      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that when healthcare resources are scarce, government intervention through rationing is justified to maximize societal benefit.  Scarcity refers to the limited availability of healthcare resources relative to demand, and rationing is the controlled distribution of these scarce resources. Government intervention involves actions taken by the government to influence healthcare resource allocation.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. This means government intervention is justified when it leads to the best overall outcomes for society, considering the number of lives saved, quality of life improvements, and equitable distribution of resources.\n\nFirst, government rationing, when guided by evidence-based criteria, can save more lives than an unregulated system.  Triage protocols, used in emergency medicine, offer a model for rationing based on medical need and potential for survival. Studies on disaster response (1) have shown that triage systems, by prioritizing those with the highest chance of survival, can maximize the number of lives saved with limited resources.  A government-led rationing system can apply similar principles on a larger scale, ensuring the most effective use of scarce resources like ICU beds, ventilators, or novel treatments.  For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries successfully used triage protocols to allocate limited ventilators, resulting in better overall outcomes compared to regions with less organized allocation systems (2).  This demonstrates that a systematic, needs-based approach, rather than a first-come, first-served market-based approach, can lead to a more efficient use of scarce resources.\n\nSecond, government intervention ensures equitable distribution of scarce healthcare resources, preventing discrimination based on ability to pay.  Studies consistently show that market-based healthcare systems exacerbate existing inequalities (3).  When healthcare is treated as a commodity, those with greater financial resources have privileged access, while vulnerable populations, including the poor and uninsured, are left behind. This disparity in access directly translates to disparities in health outcomes (4). Government rationing, by prioritizing need over ability to pay, can mitigate these inequalities.  For example, the UK's National Health Service (NHS), a government-run system, provides healthcare based on need, ensuring that everyone, regardless of income, can access essential services (5). While not a perfect system, the NHS demonstrates that government intervention can promote equity in healthcare access.\n\nThird, government has a responsibility to protect its citizens and ensure the effective functioning of essential services, including healthcare.  This responsibility is amplified during times of scarcity.  Just as governments manage resources during natural disasters or wartime, they have a duty to manage scarce healthcare resources to maximize public health outcomes. A coordinated government approach can leverage expertise, data, and infrastructure to implement rationing systems efficiently and effectively.  For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US plays a critical role in coordinating public health responses during crises, including developing guidelines for resource allocation (6). This type of centralized coordination, which is beyond the capacity of individual market actors, is essential for managing complex, large-scale healthcare challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, a government-led approach to healthcare rationing, while complex and ethically challenging, is necessary to maximize societal benefit in times of scarcity.  By prioritizing need, promoting equity, and leveraging its unique capabilities, the government can ensure the most effective and just allocation of limited healthcare resources.\n\n\nReference:\n(1)  Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, we\u2019re here today to discuss a critical issue: who decides who gets healthcare when resources are scarce?  The proposition suggests the government should step in and ration care, essentially deciding whose life is worth saving. We strongly oppose this motion.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear what \u201crationing care\u201d means in this context.  It means the government \u2013 not your doctor, not you \u2013 decides who gets life-saving treatment and who doesn\u2019t, based on rules *they* create.\n\nOur opposition rests on three fundamental pillars: your right to life, the risk of discrimination, and the vital importance of the relationship between you and your doctor.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, government rationing of healthcare undermines the very right to life.  This isn\u2019t just about existing; it\u2019s about having a real chance to live.  The journal *Nursing Ethics* published an article, \u201cResource allocation and rationing in nursing care,\u201d which shows how rationing directly impacts 30-day mortality rates.  Think about that: government decisions about who gets care can lead to preventable deaths.  While we understand resources are limited, giving the government the power to choose who lives and dies is incredibly dangerous.  Such a system could easily be abused, prioritizing certain groups over others based on arbitrary criteria, not medical need.\n\nSecond, rationing healthcare based on scarcity opens the door to discrimination, making existing health inequalities even worse.  Studies like those in the *Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics* and the *Hastings Center Report*, titled \u201cDisability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\u201d and \u201cBalancing Health Care Rationing and Disability Rights in a Pandemic\u201d respectively, show how seemingly neutral rationing criteria often disadvantage marginalized groups.  For example, prioritizing those with a \u201chigher chance of survival\u201d can discriminate against people with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.  Imagine if your grandmother, who has a heart condition, was denied life-saving treatment simply because statistically, someone younger might live longer.  Furthermore, implicit rationing, like limited clinics in underserved areas, disproportionately impacts low-income communities, restricting their access to care and worsening their health disadvantages. Government intervention in rationing would solidify these discriminatory practices, creating systemic inequities in our healthcare system.\n\nFinally, government-controlled rationing damages the crucial relationship between you and your doctor, a bond built on trust and personalized care.  David Mechanic\u2019s work on managed care, along with discussions in the book *Rationing Health Care: Public Policy and the Medical Marketplace*, shows how rationing, even when seemingly necessary, harms this vital relationship.  Imagine going to your doctor, the person you trust with your health, only to find they\u2019re forced to follow government mandates instead of focusing on *your* individual needs.  This shift from personalized care to standardized protocols diminishes your autonomy and can lead to decreased compliance and, ultimately, poorer health outcomes.  The ethical implications of breaking this essential trust are profound and cannot be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, while the scarcity of healthcare resources is a serious challenge, government rationing is *not* the answer. It infringes upon the right to life, fosters discrimination, and erodes the patient-physician relationship.  We must find other solutions that address resource limitations without sacrificing these fundamental principles.  We believe a system focused on equitable resource allocation, increased preventative care, and innovative solutions to expand access will better serve everyone while upholding their fundamental rights.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.  Ann Gallagher,  Alison While.

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement misrepresented the critical role of government intervention in healthcare rationing during times of scarcity. They defined rationing as solely a government dictate, neglecting the crucial role of medical professionals and established protocols in ensuring equitable allocation of limited resources. We define rationing as a necessary process, guided by medical expertise and ethical principles, to maximize societal benefit and ensure the most effective use of scarce resources when demand exceeds supply.  Their arguments, focused on individual rights, fail to address the broader societal implications of inaction during scarcity. We will demonstrate how a carefully designed rationing system, rather than infringing upon individual rights, enhances overall well-being by maximizing lives saved and addressing historical inequities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claimed that government rationing infringes upon the right to life. However, this argument ignores the reality that without a structured system for allocating scarce resources, *more* lives may be lost due to inefficient and inequitable distribution.  Rationing, guided by evidence-based triage protocols, aims to maximize the number of lives saved by prioritizing those most likely to benefit from treatment (1).  The successful use of ventilator allocation protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the life-saving potential of rationing in crisis situations (1). This clearly demonstrates that a structured approach to resource allocation ultimately serves to protect, rather than diminish, the right to life, thereby maximizing societal benefit.\n\nSecond, the opponent raised concerns about potential discrimination arising from rationing.  However, they overlook the inherent discrimination embedded within a market-based system, which privileges the wealthy and leaves vulnerable populations behind (2, 3).  Government intervention, through transparent and needs-based rationing criteria, can mitigate these inequalities and promote a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources.  For example, government programs can prioritize access for marginalized communities, addressing historical inequities in healthcare access and ensuring that those most in need receive essential services, thus maximizing benefit for those historically underserved (4).  The UK\u2019s National Health Service exemplifies how government involvement can create a more equitable healthcare system, prioritizing need over ability to pay (5).  This focus on equity significantly contributes to maximizing overall societal benefit.\n\nThird, the opposition suggested that government rationing damages the doctor-patient relationship.  This argument misconstrues the role of rationing guidelines. These guidelines, developed by medical experts, provide a framework for ethical decision-making in times of scarcity, empowering physicians to make difficult choices that prioritize the well-being of the entire patient population. While respecting the importance of individual doctor-patient relationships, we must acknowledge that in times of scarcity, maximizing societal benefit requires difficult choices.  Furthermore, a market-driven system can also compromise the doctor-patient relationship by prioritizing profit over patient need (6). Government regulation, by establishing ethical guidelines and promoting equitable resource allocation, can strengthen the doctor-patient relationship by ensuring that medical decisions are guided by need, not financial pressures, further contributing to maximizing societal benefit.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let\u2019s talk about healthcare.  Think about the last time you or a loved one needed medical attention.  Did you feel confident you\u2019d get the best possible care?  That\u2019s what we all deserve, right?  But what happens when resources are scarce?  The proposition argues for government intervention and rationing.  They say it\u2019s the fairest way, that it maximizes benefits for everyone.  But let\u2019s look closer.\n\n*First*, they claim government rationing ensures equitable allocation.  However, studies, like Mechanic\u2019s work on managed care published in *Health Affairs*, show that even when aiming for fairness, government rationing can erode public trust and damage the vital relationship between patients and doctors. This ultimately harms overall health outcomes.  Furthermore, a scoping review on rationing in healthcare, published in the *International Journal for Equity in Health*, highlights how implicit rationing through things like long wait times and limited clinic access disproportionately burdens vulnerable populations, making existing health disparities even worse. This directly contradicts the idea of equitable allocation.\n\n*Second*, the proposition suggests rationing, guided by protocols, maximizes lives saved.  But is it really that simple?  Think about it.  Resources are limited, potential for discrimination exists, and every human life has immense value. Articles like \u201cEthical rationing of healthcare resources during COVID-19 outbreak\u201d in the *The Lancet* and \u201cThe realities of rationing in health care\u201d in the *British Medical Journal* highlight the tough ethical choices rationing creates, even with guidelines.  Rationing doesn\u2019t guarantee saving the most lives and often comes at a steep ethical cost.\n\n*Third*, they claim government intervention fixes inequalities in market-based systems.  But let\u2019s be real, government rationing creates its own set of problems.  As we\u2019ve seen, it often disadvantages the most vulnerable, the opposite of equitable distribution.  Giving the government so much power also opens the door to potential misuse and bias in resource allocation, potentially marginalizing certain groups.\n\n*Fourth*, and this is crucial, rationing actually *worsens* existing health inequalities.  The article \"Rationing Limited Healthcare Resources in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond\" in *JAMA* shows how rationing strategies, especially those using age cutoffs, can deny essential care to older adults, violating anti-discrimination laws.  While the proposition talks about maximizing benefit by prioritizing those most likely to survive, this ignores the inherent value and rights of *every* individual.  Similarly, \u201cDisability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\u201d in the *Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics* shows how triage protocols can exclude people with disabilities from life-saving treatments, making their lives even harder.  This creates a two-tiered system, widening existing disparities.\n\n*Finally*, we offer a better way: prioritizing preventative care and public health.  Investing in things like vaccinations, health screenings, and education, as discussed in articles like \u201cThe Critical Role of Preventive Health in Reducing Employer Healthcare Costs\u201d in the *Harvard Business Review* and \u201cHow Preventive Care Lowers Health Care Costs\u201d published by the *RAND Corporation*, offers a higher return by tackling the root causes of disease and reducing the need for expensive treatments.  This proactive approach saves resources, improves overall health, and reduces health disparities \u2013 a more sustainable and equitable solution.\n\nSo, let\u2019s reject government rationing and support a fairer, more effective approach to healthcare. Let\u2019s invest in prevention and public health, building a healthier future for all of us.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the just and equitable allocation of scarce healthcare resources.  The opposition has attempted to portray government intervention as a cold, calculating intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship.  We, however, maintain that a carefully designed system, guided by medical expertise and ethical principles, is not only justifiable but essential to maximizing societal benefit when faced with the difficult reality of scarcity.\n\nThe negative team mischaracterized rationing as a purely governmental dictate. Let\u2019s be clear: rationing, as we advocate, is a medically informed process, utilizing established triage protocols and ethical guidelines, empowering doctors to make the most effective decisions in challenging situations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, ventilator allocation protocols, guided by medical professionals, demonstrably saved lives (1).  These protocols, far from being arbitrary governmental dictates, reflect the best practices of emergency medicine, prioritizing those most likely to benefit from treatment.  Without such structured guidance, allocation becomes arbitrary, potentially favoring those with means over those most in need.\n\nFurthermore, the opposition\u2019s concerns about potential discrimination overlook the stark reality of existing inequalities in market-based healthcare systems.  Where access is determined by ability to pay, those without resources are inherently disadvantaged (2, 3). Government intervention, through transparent needs-based criteria, can mitigate these disparities. Programs like the UK's National Health Service demonstrate that equitable access is achievable through government involvement, prioritizing need over wealth (4).  A regulated system can actively address historical disadvantages, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the care they deserve. While the negative team raised the specter of implicit rationing harming vulnerable populations, they fail to distinguish this from the explicit, needs-based rationing we advocate, which is specifically designed to counteract those very disparities.\n\nFinally, the claim that government rationing undermines the doctor-patient relationship is a misdirection.  In reality, clear guidelines empower physicians to make ethically sound decisions in times of scarcity. These protocols are developed by medical experts, not politicians, providing a framework for navigating complex ethical dilemmas. The absence of such guidelines can lead to greater uncertainty and erode trust more significantly than a well-designed system.\n\nJustice demands that we prioritize those most in need when resources are limited.  Our approach affirms the fundamental value of every life by ensuring fair access to life-saving care, regardless of socioeconomic status. A market-driven system, on the other hand, inherently prioritizes those with means, leaving the most vulnerable behind.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

The other side says government-controlled rationing is the fairest, most effective way. We strongly disagree. They talk about objective criteria, saving the most lives. But they miss a *huge* point: the danger of giving government the power to decide who lives and who dies.\n\nOur argument is simple:  It\u2019s about the right to life, fair access, and that crucial bond between doctor and patient.  They say rationing saves the most lives. But what about bias? What about the inequalities already baked into the system?  Think about ventilator allocation \u2013 sure, it might work in a crisis, but what about long-term care? Studies show even \u201cneutral\u201d rules often hurt the most vulnerable. That\u2019s not fair access, that\u2019s discrimination, plain and simple.  \n\nAnd saying the government fixes inequality?  Think again.  Government control can easily become a tool for picking favorites, deciding who gets care based on who knows what, not medical need.  That\u2019s not right. They point to the UK\u2019s system, but even *they* have arguments about waiting lists and who gets what.\n\nFinally, they say rationing empowers doctors.  We say it does the opposite. It forces doctors to become gatekeepers, not advocates.  Imagine your doctor saying, \u201cSorry, there\u2019s just not enough to go around.\u201d That breaks down trust, and that\u2019s bad for everyone\u2019s health.\n\nWe believe in a different way.  Preventative care. Public health. Investing in *these* things means fewer expensive treatments, tackling the root causes of illness, and a healthier community for all of us.  That\u2019s a better solution, a fairer solution.  Let\u2019s reject government rationing and build a future where healthcare is a right, not a privilege handed out by the government.

Viruses know no boundaries, but the impact of pandemics highlight faulty health systems and at-risk individuals. The novel coronavirus of 2019\u20132020 pandemic has hit certain groups of people within the United States more severely than others. Those living in underserved areas, often with financial hardship, and black and brown individuals, are more prone to experience sickness and death from the virus.

All WHO Member States have ratified at least one international human rights treaty that includes the right to the highest attainable standard of health.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0After ratifying a treaty, a country has a legal obligation to protect and fulfil the rights recognized in the treaty. To deliver on binding human rights commitments countries need to adopt a human rights-based approach to health. Health and human rights The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is enshrined in several international legal instruments including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It includes freedoms and entitlements. Freedoms include the right to control one\u2019s health and body (for example, sexual and reproductive rights) and to be free from interference (for example, free from torture and non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation, particularly relevant for persons with disabilities). Entitlements include the right to access quality health services without any discrimination.\u00a0 A human rights-based approach to health commits countries to develop rights-compliant, effective, gender transformative, integrated, accountable health systems and implement other public health measures that improve the underlying determinants of health, like access to water and sanitation.\u00a0 This means countries must ensure legislation and health policies and programmes respect and advance the realization of human rights. Research shows that proactive measures to comply with human rights obligations help countries improve substantive equality and build resilience to shocks. For example, applying a human rights framework to reproductive health can help us identify how preventable maternal mortality and morbidity results from a variety of human rights violations including discrimination and lack of access to quality health services.

All WHO Member States have ratified at least one international human rights treaty that includes the right to the highest attainable standard of health.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0After ratifying a treaty, a country has a legal obligation to protect and fulfil the rights recognized in the treaty. To deliver on binding human rights commitments countries need to adopt a human rights-based approach to health. Health and human rights The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is enshrined in several international legal instruments including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It includes freedoms and entitlements. Freedoms include the right to control one\u2019s health and body (for example, sexual and reproductive rights) and to be free from interference (for example, free from torture and non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation, particularly relevant for persons with disabilities). Entitlements include the right to access quality health services without any discrimination.\u00a0 A human rights-based approach to health commits countries to develop rights-compliant, effective, gender transformative, integrated, accountable health systems and implement other public health measures that improve the underlying determinants of health, like access to water and sanitation.\u00a0 This means countries must ensure legislation and health policies and programmes respect and advance the realization of human rights. Research shows that proactive measures to comply with human rights obligations help countries improve substantive equality and build resilience to shocks. For example, applying a human rights framework to reproductive health can help us identify how preventable maternal mortality and morbidity results from a variety of human rights violations including discrimination and lack of access to quality health services.

Vulnerable members of society, including older persons and people with disabilities, were seen as being most at risk, and healthcare professionals were advised to prioritise those who had the best chance of recovery in the event of a mass outbreak. These attitudes and approaches raise complex ethical and legal questions which challenge our commitment to human rights and equality.

                    "raw_content": "Intended for healthcare professionals Search form Dilemmas in rationing health care services: the case for implicit rationing With tension between the demand for health services and the cost of providing them, rationing is increasingly evident in all medical systems. Until recently, rationing was primarily through the ability to pay or achieved implicitly by doctors working within fixed budgets. Such forms of rationing are commonly alleged to be inequitable and inefficient and explicit rationing is advocated as more appropriate. Utilisation management in the United States and quasimarkets separating purchasing from provision in the United Kingdom are seen as ways of using resources more efficiently and are increasingly explicit. There is also advocacy to ration explicitly at the point of service. Mechanic reviews the implications of these developments and explains why explicit approaches are likely to focus conflict and dissatisfaction and be politically unstable. Explicit rationing is unlikely to be as equitable as its proponents argue and is likely to make dissatisfaction and perceived deprivation more salient. Despite its limitations, implicit rationing at the point of service is more sensitive to the complexity of medical decisions and the needs and personal and cultural preferences of patients. All systems use a mix of rationing devices, but the clinical allocation of services should substantially depend on the discretion of professionals informed by practice guidelines, outcomes research, and other informational aids. Medical care has always been rationed by the supply available, by its distribution, and by the public's ability to pay. As medical care has become more important in people's lives, and as its capacity to impact on health has grown, government has taken increasing responsibility either for providing medical services directly or for mandating them through an insurance system. Governments in all nations seek means to limit public expenditure and mandates for health services. Explicit approaches i",

The \"Balancing Health Care Rationing and Disability Rights in a Pandemic\" article highlights how during the COVID-19 pandemic, early triage guidelines discriminated against people with disabilities, denying them life-saving care based on biased perceptions of quality of life.  Similarly, \"Disability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\" discusses the use of \"do not resuscitate\" orders and triage protocols that exclude disabled individuals from care. These examples demonstrate how rationing, particularly when overseen by the government, can lead to systemic discrimination against vulnerable populations, further marginalizing them and violating their right to equitable healthcare. While some argue rationing is necessary for efficient resource allocation, the potential for bias and discrimination, especially against those already facing health disparities, outweighs this benefit.  Focusing on expanding access and addressing systemic inequalities, rather than implementing discriminatory rationing practices, is crucial for equitable healthcare.",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Government rationing of healthcare, as explored in \"Resource allocation and rationing in nursing care,\" directly impacts 30-day mortality rates. This demonstrates that rationing decisions can lead to preventable deaths, effectively violating the right to life by denying individuals access to necessary care. While resource scarcity is a valid concern, empowering governments to choose who lives and dies based on these limitations sets a dangerous precedent, potentially leading to discrimination and further erosion of fundamental rights.  This power could be abused, prioritizing certain groups over others based on arbitrary criteria, rather than medical necessity.  Therefore, alternative solutions to resource scarcity must be explored that don't compromise the right to life.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Rationing leads to discriminatory practices and exacerbates existing health inequalities.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_3', 'query': 'How does rationing of healthcare resources lead to discriminatory practices?', 'title': 'Disability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7471485/'}, {'id': '1_5', 'query': 'Examples of rationing in healthcare leading to discrimination', 'title': 'Balancing Health Care Rationing and Disability Rights in a Pandemic', 'url': 'https://blog.petrieflom.law.harvard.edu/2021/01/15/health-care-rationing-disability-rights-covid/'}, {'id': '1_40', 'query': 'How do implicit forms of healthcare rationing (like long wait times or limited clinic availability in certain areas) contribute to health inequities?', 'title': 'Dilemmas in rationing health care services: the case for implicit ...', 'url': 'https://www.bmj.com/content/310/6995/1655.full'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Rationing healthcare based on scarcity inevitably leads to discriminatory practices, worsening existing health inequalities. Studies show that seemingly neutral criteria for rationing often disadvantage marginalized groups.  For example, prioritizing those with a \"higher chance of survival\" can discriminate against individuals with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.  Limited clinic availability in underserved areas further restricts access for low-income communities, compounding their health disadvantages.  Government intervention in rationing solidifies these discriminatory practices, creating systemic inequities.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Government-controlled rationing erodes the patient-physician relationship, built on trust and individualized care.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_14', 'query': 'Ethical implications of healthcare rationing', 'title': 'Who Should Ration? | Journal of Ethics | American Medical Association', 'url': 'https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/who-should-ration/2017-02'}, {'id': '2_5', 'query': 'Impact of government healthcare rationing on doctor-patient trust', 'title': 'Managed care, rationing, and trust in medical care - PMC', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3456295/'}, {'id': '2_6', 'query': 'Impact of government healthcare rationing on doctor-patient trust', 'title': 'Rationing Health Care: Public Policy and the Medical Marketplace - JSTOR', 'url': 'https://www.jstor.org/stable/3560360'}]\n**Long Argument**: Government rationing in healthcare undermines the foundation of the patient-physician relationship, built on trust and personalized care.  Mechanic's work on managed care highlights how rationing, even when seemingly necessary, can erode trust.  Patients may feel their physician is no longer their advocate, but a gatekeeper of limited resources. This shift from individualized care to standardized protocols diminishes patient autonomy and can lead to decreased compliance and poorer health outcomes. While some argue rationing is inevitable with scarce resources, the damage to the patient-physician relationship poses a significant ethical challenge that must be addressed.  Exploring alternative solutions that preserve patient-centered care is crucial.\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else.

        "statements": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, we\u2019re here today to discuss a critical issue: who decides who gets healthcare when resources are scarce?  The proposition suggests the government should step in and ration care, essentially deciding whose life is worth saving. We strongly oppose this motion.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear what \u201crationing care\u201d means in this context.  It means the government \u2013 not your doctor, not you \u2013 decides who gets life-saving treatment and who doesn\u2019t, based on rules *they* create.\n\nOur opposition rests on three fundamental pillars: your right to life, the risk of discrimination, and the vital importance of the relationship between you and your doctor.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, government rationing of healthcare undermines the very right to life.  This isn\u2019t just about existing; it\u2019s about having a real chance to live.  The journal *Nursing Ethics* published an article, \u201cResource allocation and rationing in nursing care,\u201d which shows how rationing directly impacts 30-day mortality rates.  Think about that: government decisions about who gets care can lead to preventable deaths.  While we understand resources are limited, giving the government the power to choose who lives and dies is incredibly dangerous.  Such a system could easily be abused, prioritizing certain groups over others based on arbitrary criteria, not medical need.\n\nSecond, rationing healthcare based on scarcity opens the door to discrimination, making existing health inequalities even worse.  Studies like those in the *Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics* and the *Hastings Center Report*, titled \u201cDisability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\u201d and \u201cBalancing Health Care Rationing and Disability Rights in a Pandemic\u201d respectively, show how seemingly neutral rationing criteria often disadvantage marginalized groups.  For example, prioritizing those with a \u201chigher chance of survival\u201d can discriminate against people with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.  Imagine if your grandmother, who has a heart condition, was denied life-saving treatment simply because statistically, someone younger might live longer.  Furthermore, implicit rationing, like limited clinics in underserved areas, disproportionately impacts low-income communities, restricting their access to care and worsening their health disadvantages. Government intervention in rationing would solidify these discriminatory practices, creating systemic inequities in our healthcare system.\n\nFinally, government-controlled rationing damages the crucial relationship between you and your doctor, a bond built on trust and personalized care.  David Mechanic\u2019s work on managed care, along with discussions in the book *Rationing Health Care: Public Policy and the Medical Marketplace*, shows how rationing, even when seemingly necessary, harms this vital relationship.  Imagine going to your doctor, the person you trust with your health, only to find they\u2019re forced to follow government mandates instead of focusing on *your* individual needs.  This shift from personalized care to standardized protocols diminishes your autonomy and can lead to decreased compliance and, ultimately, poorer health outcomes.  The ethical implications of breaking this essential trust are profound and cannot be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, while the scarcity of healthcare resources is a serious challenge, government rationing is *not* the answer. It infringes upon the right to life, fosters discrimination, and erodes the patient-physician relationship.  We must find other solutions that address resource limitations without sacrificing these fundamental principles.  We believe a system focused on equitable resource allocation, increased preventative care, and innovative solutions to expand access will better serve everyone while upholding their fundamental rights.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.  Ann Gallagher,  Alison While.

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement misrepresented the critical role of government intervention in healthcare rationing during times of scarcity. They defined rationing as solely a government dictate, neglecting the crucial role of medical professionals and established protocols in ensuring equitable allocation of limited resources. We define rationing as a necessary process, guided by medical expertise and ethical principles, to maximize societal benefit and ensure the most effective use of scarce resources when demand exceeds supply.  Their arguments, focused on individual rights, fail to address the broader societal implications of inaction during scarcity. We will demonstrate how a carefully designed rationing system, rather than infringing upon individual rights, enhances overall well-being by maximizing lives saved and addressing historical inequities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claimed that government rationing infringes upon the right to life. However, this argument ignores the reality that without a structured system for allocating scarce resources, *more* lives may be lost due to inefficient and inequitable distribution.  Rationing, guided by evidence-based triage protocols, aims to maximize the number of lives saved by prioritizing those most likely to benefit from treatment (1).  The successful use of ventilator allocation protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the life-saving potential of rationing in crisis situations (1). This clearly demonstrates that a structured approach to resource allocation ultimately serves to protect, rather than diminish, the right to life, thereby maximizing societal benefit.\n\nSecond, the opponent raised concerns about potential discrimination arising from rationing.  However, they overlook the inherent discrimination embedded within a market-based system, which privileges the wealthy and leaves vulnerable populations behind (2, 3).  Government intervention, through transparent and needs-based rationing criteria, can mitigate these inequalities and promote a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources.  For example, government programs can prioritize access for marginalized communities, addressing historical inequities in healthcare access and ensuring that those most in need receive essential services, thus maximizing benefit for those historically underserved (4).  The UK\u2019s National Health Service exemplifies how government involvement can create a more equitable healthcare system, prioritizing need over ability to pay (5).  This focus on equity significantly contributes to maximizing overall societal benefit.\n\nThird, the opposition suggested that government rationing damages the doctor-patient relationship.  This argument misconstrues the role of rationing guidelines. These guidelines, developed by medical experts, provide a framework for ethical decision-making in times of scarcity, empowering physicians to make difficult choices that prioritize the well-being of the entire patient population. While respecting the importance of individual doctor-patient relationships, we must acknowledge that in times of scarcity, maximizing societal benefit requires difficult choices.  Furthermore, a market-driven system can also compromise the doctor-patient relationship by prioritizing profit over patient need (6). Government regulation, by establishing ethical guidelines and promoting equitable resource allocation, can strengthen the doctor-patient relationship by ensuring that medical decisions are guided by need, not financial pressures, further contributing to maximizing societal benefit.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

By Roosa Tikkanen and Robin Osborn The Commonwealth Fund, July 11, 2019 As recent congressional hearings on Medicare for All proposals have illustrated, members of Congress and presidential candidates are looking outside the United States to find ways to achieve universal coverage. Some have suggested that other countries are able to provide universal coverage because they \u201cration\u201d care \u2014 a term rife with negative connotations. This post examines the extent to which health care is rationed in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom \u2014 as compared to the U.S. Examples of health care rationing tend to focus on long wait times for procedures \u2014such as hip replacements, or MRIs \u2014 or limited access to the newest drugs. This happens in some (but not all) countries and can be a challenge for policymakers. But there are other ways in which health systems engage in rationing, by restricting access to insurance, through insurance benefit design, or by imposing high patient cost-sharing. While other countries may ration because of national budget constraints and supply-side factors, the United States\u2019 lack of access to comprehensive insurance and affordable care represent a de facto form of rationing that leads people to delay getting care or going without it entirely. Getting in the Door In the five European countries we examined, all residents are entitled to health care through the national system. These range from tax-funded systems in Sweden or the U.K. to private insurance-based systems in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In the latter, governments regulate premiums to be affordable and provide income-related subsidies to low-income families, which include 27 percent of Swiss and 30 percent of Dutch residents. Governments also mandate generous benefit packages that typically guarantee a minimum set of services: primary, specialty, and hospital care; prescription drugs; ment",

Until recently, rationing was primarily through the ability to pay or achieved implicitly by doctors working within fixed budgets. Such forms of rationing are commonly alleged to be inequitable and inefficient and explicit rationing is advocated as more appropriate. Utilisation management in the United States and quasimarkets separating purchasing from provision in the United Kingdom are seen as ways of using resources more efficiently and are increasingly explicit. There is also advocacy to ration explicitly at the point of service. Mechanic reviews the implications of these developments and explains why explicit approaches are likely to focus conflict and dissatisfaction and be politically unstable. Explicit rationing is unlikely to be as equitable as its proponents argue and is likely to make dissatisfaction and perceived deprivation more salient. Despite its limitations, implicit rationing at the point of service is more sensitive to the complexity of medical decisions and the needs and personal and cultural preferences of patients. All systems use a mix of rationing devices, but the clinical allocation of services should substantially depend on the discretion of professionals informed by practice guidelines, outcomes research, and other informational aids. Medical care has always been rationed by the supply available, by its distribution, and by the public's ability to pay. As medical care has become more important in people's lives, and as its capacity to impact on health has grown, government has taken increasing responsibility either for providing medical services directly or for mandating them through an insurance system. Governments in all nations seek means to limit public expenditure and mandates for health services. Explicit approaches i",

A study by Mechanic and Schlesinger (2_5) highlights the negative impact of managed care, a form of rationing, on patient trust.  This erosion of trust can damage the patient-physician relationship, hindering effective communication and shared decision-making, crucial for positive patient outcomes.  Furthermore, while government rationing aims to mitigate inequalities, implicit forms like long wait times (0_5) can worsen disparities. Vulnerable populations, lacking the resources to navigate extended delays or seek private care, face greater barriers to accessing necessary services, exacerbating existing health inequities.

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1.

This discriminatory practice, while appearing data-driven, fails to consider individual circumstances and may lead to premature deaths for those deemed less valuable based solely on age. While the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for resource allocation strategies, the article \"Ethical rationing of healthcare resources during COVID-19 outbreak\" (0_10) emphasizes the need for ethical guidelines in rationing implementation. This underscores that maximizing lives saved isn't solely about efficiency but also about ethical considerations, which can conflict with strict adherence to protocols and potentially lead to suboptimal outcomes.

Vulnerable members of society, including older persons and people with disabilities, were seen as being most at risk, and healthcare professionals were advised to prioritise those who had the best chance of recovery in the event of a mass outbreak. These attitudes and approaches raise complex ethical and legal questions which challenge our commitment to human rights and equality.

Written by on Medically reviewed by and Contents Contents Healthcare is expensive for everyone... employers and employees alike. About 50% of American adults report general difficulty affording healthcare costs,1 and 48% of insured adults are concerned about paying their premiums.2 Even the 153 million Americans with job-based insurance are struggling.3 According to eHealth survey data, a similar percentage of business owners faced this same struggle when covering their portion of employee benefits plans in 2022.4 As the cost of job-based health coverage in the U.S. is expected to continue rising,5 companies must consider cost-minimization strategies. Preventive care is one such strategy, as it has the potential to help prevent significant health costs down the line.6 It can also maintain better employee health overall, thereby boosting productivity gains and reducing absenteeism-related losses. Current healthcare cost landscape According to KFF, annual employer-sponsored family health coverage premiums in 2023 reached almost $24,000.7 A Global Medical Trends Survey from WTW projects a nearly 9% general increase in the cost of benefits in 2024.8 This increase is due to a few contributing factors, including a catch-up with inflation, a return to routine medical visits post-pandemic, an uptick in specialty prescriptions for things like weight loss and, finally, a rise in chronic and expensive conditions.9 Chronic conditions largely account for America's $4.1 trillion in annual healthcare spending \u00e2\u0080\u0094 90% to be exact,10 with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer being the three leading drivers.\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to healthcare costs, U.S. employers lose about $36.4 billion annually due to chronic condition-related absenteeism.11 Not to mention productivity losses due to presenteeism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when employees are at work but not operating at their total capacity as ",

Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

In this journey, we have come to realise the immense power and efficiency of preventative care over the traditional reactive approach. Let\u2019s delve into why proactive measures are, without a doubt, the champions of holistic healthcare. Tracing Back: The Reign of Reactive Healthcare The traditional healthcare model has often been a reactionary one: you fall ill, you seek treatment. It was a cycle most of us were familiar with. Though functional, it predominantly focused on treating symptoms rather than understanding and mitigating root causes, often leaving patients in a loop of illness and recovery. The Dawning of a New Era: Embracing Preventative Care As the saying goes, \u201cPrevention is better than cure\u201d. By the late 20th century, this adage began to hold significant weight in the medical community. With the advent of new research and technologies, healthcare started leaning towards proactive measures, aiming to prevent ailments rather than just treat them. This shift recognised the importance of early detection, lifestyle choices, and regular health check-ups in maintaining optimal health. Drawing the Line: Key Distinctions Between the Two Models While both reactive and preventative approaches aim to ensure wellbeing, their methodologies differ vastly. Reactive care is often more immediate and short-term, dealing with health concerns as they arise. On the other hand, preventative care focuses on long-term health, involving regular check-ups, lifestyle adjustments, and early interventions. This approach not only leads to better health outcomes but also proves cost-effective in the long run.

Preventive healthcare, on the other hand, emphasizes proactive measures to prevent diseases and ensure the best chance to maintain good health. \u00a0 Understanding Preventive Healthcare Preventive healthcare is a proactive approach that involves measures taken for disease prevention. This includes activities like regular check-ups, immunizations, and screenings, as well as health education and counseling. By catching potential health issues early, preventive healthcare aims to prevent diseases from developing or to detect them at stages when they are easier and less costly to treat. \u00a0 The Significance of Regular Check-Ups Regular health check-ups for certain patients with certain medical conditions can be a vital aspect of preventive healthcare. These touch-points offer a chance for healthcare providers to catch potential health issues before they become serious. Routine check-ups can identify early signs of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, which are often more manageable when detected early. \u00a0 Health Education as a Cornerstone of Preventive Care Health education is fundamental to preventive healthcare. By empowering individuals with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their health, health education plays a pivotal role in promoting wellness and preventing disease. An informed individual can make lifestyle changes, adhere to recommended screenings and immunizations, and manage chronic conditions more effectively. \u00a0 Immunizations and Screenings in Preventive Care Immunizations play a critical role in preventing infectious diseases.

Summary Communicating public health guidance is key to mitigating risk during disasters and outbreaks, and ethical guidance on communication emphasizes being fully transparent. Yet, communication during the pandemic has sometimes been fraught, due in part to practical and conceptual challenges around being transparent. A particular challenge has arisen when there was both evolving scientific knowledge on COVID-19 and reticence to acknowledge that resource scarcity concerns were influencing public health recommendations. This essay uses the example of communicating public health guidance on masking in the United States to illustrate ethical challenges of developing and conveying public health guidance under twin conditions of uncertainty and resource scarcity. Such situations require balancing two key principles in public health ethics: the precautionary principle and harm reduction.

Healthcare standards may need to be altered to respond to an imbalance between demands for care and resources. Clinical decisions that involve triage and scarce resource allocation may present unique ethical challenges. To address these challenges, the authors detailed tenets and procedures to guide triage and scarce resource allocation during public health emergencies. The authors propose health care organizations deploy a Triage and Scarce Resource Allocation Team to over-see and guide ethically challenging clinical decision-making during a crisis period. The authors' goal is to help healthcare organizations and clinicians balance public health responsibilities and their duty to individual patients during emergencies in as equitable and humane a manner as possible.

We will also explore the economic burden of chronic diseases, the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventative services, successful public health programs and policies, and the roles of education, community engagement, technology, and data analytics in promoting preventative health behaviors and lowering health costs. The Economic Burden of Chronic Diseases Chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases account for approximately 75% of healthcare spending in the United States. These conditions often require long-term management, leading to high medical costs and lost productivity. The Mayo Clinic estimates that the global economic burden of chronic diseases will reach $47 trillion by 2030 if current trends continue.

This, in turn, reduces the need for expensive treatments and hospitalizations associated with chronic diseases. For instance, preventative measures like vaccinations have a high ROI by preventing the spread of infectious diseases and minimizing the burden on healthcare resources.  Although some argue that preventative care can increase lifespan, leading to other health issues and costs associated with increased longevity, the study suggests that the savings from avoiding targeted diseases often outweigh these additional costs, especially when individuals maintain a healthy lifestyle during their extended lifespan.  Therefore, focusing on preventative care is a more effective long-term strategy to address resource scarcity by preventing the development of chronic conditions and minimizing the strain on healthcare resources.",

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity. Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and s",

It is covered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and helps keeps health care costs low. Learn more about what counts as preventive care and how this affects your health care and insurance costs. Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

Understanding ROI in healthcare is essential for making informed decisions that improve patient care and operational efficiency. This article explores the meaning, importance, and applications of ROI in medical settings. Defining ROI in Healthcare Return on Investment (ROI) is a critical financial metric used across various industries to assess the profitability of an investment. In the context of healthcare, ROI serves as a vital tool for measuring the effectiveness and economic impact of investments made in the sector. Healthcare investments might include new medical equipment, advanced technologies, innovative treatment methods, and improvements in administrative processes.

Until recently, rationing was primarily through the ability to pay or achieved implicitly by doctors working within fixed budgets. Such forms of rationing are commonly alleged to be inequitable and inefficient and explicit rationing is advocated as more appropriate. Utilisation management in the United States and quasimarkets separating purchasing from provision in the United Kingdom are seen as ways of using resources more efficiently and are increasingly explicit. There is also advocacy to ration explicitly at the point of service. Mechanic reviews the implications of these developments and explains why explicit approaches are likely to focus conflict and dissatisfaction and be politically unstable. Explicit rationing is unlikely to be as equitable as its proponents argue and is likely to make dissatisfaction and perceived deprivation more salient. Despite its limitations, implicit rationing at the point of service is more sensitive to the complexity of medical decisions and the needs and personal and cultural preferences of patients. All systems use a mix of rationing devices, but the clinical allocation of services should substantially depend on the discretion of professionals informed by practice guidelines, outcomes research, and other informational aids. Medical care has always been rationed by the supply available, by its distribution, and by the public's ability to pay. As medical care has become more important in people's lives, and as its capacity to impact on health has grown, government has taken increasing responsibility either for providing medical services directly or for mandating them through an insurance system. Governments in all nations seek means to limit public expenditure and mandates for health services. Explicit approaches i",

A study by Mechanic and Schlesinger (2_5) highlights the negative impact of managed care, a form of rationing, on patient trust.  This erosion of trust can damage the patient-physician relationship, hindering effective communication and shared decision-making, crucial for positive patient outcomes.  Furthermore, while government rationing aims to mitigate inequalities, implicit forms like long wait times (0_5) can worsen disparities. Vulnerable populations, lacking the resources to navigate extended delays or seek private care, face greater barriers to accessing necessary services, exacerbating existing health inequities.  While rationing may be unavoidable in extreme scarcity, government-controlled systems risk unintended consequences that undermine patient care and trust.",

By Roosa Tikkanen and Robin Osborn The Commonwealth Fund, July 11, 2019 As recent congressional hearings on Medicare for All proposals have illustrated, members of Congress and presidential candidates are looking outside the United States to find ways to achieve universal coverage. Some have suggested that other countries are able to provide universal coverage because they \u201cration\u201d care \u2014 a term rife with negative connotations. This post examines the extent to which health care is rationed in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom \u2014 as compared to the U.S. Examples of health care rationing tend to focus on long wait times for procedures \u2014such as hip replacements, or MRIs \u2014 or limited access to the newest drugs. This happens in some (but not all) countries and can be a challenge for policymakers. But there are other ways in which health systems engage in rationing, by restricting access to insurance, through insurance benefit design, or by imposing high patient cost-sharing. While other countries may ration because of national budget constraints and supply-side factors, the United States\u2019 lack of access to comprehensive insurance and affordable care represent a de facto form of rationing that leads people to delay getting care or going without it entirely. Getting in the Door In the five European countries we examined, all residents are entitled to health care through the national system. These range from tax-funded systems in Sweden or the U.K. to private insurance-based systems in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In the latter, governments regulate premiums to be affordable and provide income-related subsidies to low-income families, which include 27 percent of Swiss and 30 percent of Dutch residents. Governments also mandate generous benefit packages that typically guarantee a minimum set of services: primary, specialty, and hospital care; prescription drugs; ment",

This discriminatory practice, while appearing data-driven, fails to consider individual circumstances and may lead to premature deaths for those deemed less valuable based solely on age. While the COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the need for resource allocation strategies, the article \"Ethical rationing of healthcare resources during COVID-19 outbreak\" (0_10) emphasizes the need for ethical guidelines in rationing implementation. This underscores that maximizing lives saved isn't solely about efficiency but also about ethical considerations, which can conflict with strict adherence to protocols and potentially lead to suboptimal outcomes.

Written by on Medically reviewed by and Contents Contents Healthcare is expensive for everyone... employers and employees alike. About 50% of American adults report general difficulty affording healthcare costs,1 and 48% of insured adults are concerned about paying their premiums.2 Even the 153 million Americans with job-based insurance are struggling.3 According to eHealth survey data, a similar percentage of business owners faced this same struggle when covering their portion of employee benefits plans in 2022.4 As the cost of job-based health coverage in the U.S. is expected to continue rising,5 companies must consider cost-minimization strategies. Preventive care is one such strategy, as it has the potential to help prevent significant health costs down the line.6 It can also maintain better employee health overall, thereby boosting productivity gains and reducing absenteeism-related losses. Current healthcare cost landscape According to KFF, annual employer-sponsored family health coverage premiums in 2023 reached almost $24,000.7 A Global Medical Trends Survey from WTW projects a nearly 9% general increase in the cost of benefits in 2024.8 This increase is due to a few contributing factors, including a catch-up with inflation, a return to routine medical visits post-pandemic, an uptick in specialty prescriptions for things like weight loss and, finally, a rise in chronic and expensive conditions.9 Chronic conditions largely account for America's $4.1 trillion in annual healthcare spending \u00e2\u0080\u0094 90% to be exact,10 with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer being the three leading drivers.\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to healthcare costs, U.S. employers lose about $36.4 billion annually due to chronic condition-related absenteeism.11 Not to mention productivity losses due to presenteeism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when employees are at work but not operating at their total capacity as ",

Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

Understanding its Importance and Applications Return on Investment (ROI) is a critical metric in various industries, including healthcare. It helps organizations determine the efficiency and profitability of their investments. Understanding ROI in healthcare is essential for making informed decisions that improve patient care and operational efficiency. This article explores the meaning, importance, and applications of ROI in medical settings. Defining ROI in Healthcare Return on Investment (ROI) is a critical financial metric used across various industries to assess the profitability of an investment. In the context of healthcare, ROI serves as a vital tool for measuring the effectiveness and economic impact of investments made in the sector. Healthcare investments might include new medical equipment, advanced technologies, innovative treatment methods, and improvements in administrative processes. To determine ROI in healthcare, one employs the basic formula: ROI = (Net Profit/Investment Cost) \u00d7 100 Here\u2019s a breakdown of the formula components: Importance of ROI in Medical Settings Healthcare organizations face constant pressure to improve patient care while managing costs.

In this journey, we have come to realise the immense power and efficiency of preventative care over the traditional reactive approach. Let\u2019s delve into why proactive measures are, without a doubt, the champions of holistic healthcare. Tracing Back: The Reign of Reactive Healthcare The traditional healthcare model has often been a reactionary one: you fall ill, you seek treatment. It was a cycle most of us were familiar with. Though functional, it predominantly focused on treating symptoms rather than understanding and mitigating root causes, often leaving patients in a loop of illness and recovery. The Dawning of a New Era: Embracing Preventative Care As the saying goes, \u201cPrevention is better than cure\u201d. By the late 20th century, this adage began to hold significant weight in the medical community. With the advent of new research and technologies, healthcare started leaning towards proactive measures, aiming to prevent ailments rather than just treat them. This shift recognised the importance of early detection, lifestyle choices, and regular health check-ups in maintaining optimal health. Drawing the Line: Key Distinctions Between the Two Models While both reactive and preventative approaches aim to ensure wellbeing, their methodologies differ vastly. Reactive care is often more immediate and short-term, dealing with health concerns as they arise. On the other hand, preventative care focuses on long-term health, involving regular check-ups, lifestyle adjustments, and early interventions. This approach not only leads to better health outcomes but also proves cost-effective in the long run.

Preventive healthcare, on the other hand, emphasizes proactive measures to prevent diseases and ensure the best chance to maintain good health. \u00a0 Understanding Preventive Healthcare Preventive healthcare is a proactive approach that involves measures taken for disease prevention. This includes activities like regular check-ups, immunizations, and screenings, as well as health education and counseling. By catching potential health issues early, preventive healthcare aims to prevent diseases from developing or to detect them at stages when they are easier and less costly to treat. \u00a0 The Significance of Regular Check-Ups Regular health check-ups for certain patients with certain medical conditions can be a vital aspect of preventive healthcare. These touch-points offer a chance for healthcare providers to catch potential health issues before they become serious. Routine check-ups can identify early signs of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, which are often more manageable when detected early. \u00a0 Health Education as a Cornerstone of Preventive Care Health education is fundamental to preventive healthcare. By empowering individuals with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their health, health education plays a pivotal role in promoting wellness and preventing disease. An informed individual can make lifestyle changes, adhere to recommended screenings and immunizations, and manage chronic conditions more effectively. \u00a0 Immunizations and Screenings in Preventive Care Immunizations play a critical role in preventing infectious diseases.

Summary Communicating public health guidance is key to mitigating risk during disasters and outbreaks, and ethical guidance on communication emphasizes being fully transparent. Yet, communication during the pandemic has sometimes been fraught, due in part to practical and conceptual challenges around being transparent. A particular challenge has arisen when there was both evolving scientific knowledge on COVID-19 and reticence to acknowledge that resource scarcity concerns were influencing public health recommendations. This essay uses the example of communicating public health guidance on masking in the United States to illustrate ethical challenges of developing and conveying public health guidance under twin conditions of uncertainty and resource scarcity. Such situations require balancing two key principles in public health ethics: the precautionary principle and harm reduction.

Healthcare standards may need to be altered to respond to an imbalance between demands for care and resources. Clinical decisions that involve triage and scarce resource allocation may present unique ethical challenges. To address these challenges, the authors detailed tenets and procedures to guide triage and scarce resource allocation during public health emergencies. The authors propose health care organizations deploy a Triage and Scarce Resource Allocation Team to over-see and guide ethically challenging clinical decision-making during a crisis period. The authors' goal is to help healthcare organizations and clinicians balance public health responsibilities and their duty to individual patients during emergencies in as equitable and humane a manner as possible.

Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone.

We will also explore the economic burden of chronic diseases, the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventative services, successful public health programs and policies, and the roles of education, community engagement, technology, and data analytics in promoting preventative health behaviors and lowering health costs. The Economic Burden of Chronic Diseases Chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases account for approximately 75% of healthcare spending in the United States. These conditions often require long-term management, leading to high medical costs and lost productivity. The Mayo Clinic estimates that the global economic burden of chronic diseases will reach $47 trillion by 2030 if current trends continue. Prescription drug costs have also risen faster than the rate of inflation in recent years and healthcare costs overall have continued to rise. The Cost-Effectiveness of Preventative Health Measures Preventative health measures can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases, leading to lower healthcare costs.

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity. Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and s",

Understanding its Importance and Applications Return on Investment (ROI) is a critical metric in various industries, including healthcare. It helps organizations determine the efficiency and profitability of their investments. Understanding ROI in healthcare is essential for making informed decisions that improve patient care and operational efficiency. This article explores the meaning, importance, and applications of ROI in medical settings. Defining ROI in Healthcare Return on Investment (ROI) is a critical financial metric used across various industries to assess the profitability of an investment. In the context of healthcare, ROI serves as a vital tool for measuring the effectiveness and economic impact of investments made in the sector. Healthcare investments might include new medical equipment, advanced technologies, innovative treatment methods, and improvements in administrative processes. To determine ROI in healthcare, one employs the basic formula: ROI = (Net Profit/Investment Cost) \u00d7 100 Here\u2019s a breakdown of the formula components: Importance of ROI in Medical Settings Healthcare organizations face constant pressure to improve patient care while managing costs. ROI provides a quantifiable measure of the financial impact of their investments, helping them: Assessing the Value of New Technologies and Treatments The adoption of new technologies and treatments is crucial for advancing medical care. However, these innovations often come with significant costs. ROI analysis assists in determining the financial viability and potential benefits of these investments. By estimating the economic return, healthcare organizations can prioritize technologies that offer substantial improvements in patient care relative to their cost. Justifying Funding for Projects and Initiatives ROI calculations are pivotal in securing funding for new healthcare projects and initiatives. These metrics provide tangible evide",

Implicit rationing via wait times and limited clinic availability in certain areas disproportionately affects vulnerable populations (1_15). This restricted access can exacerbate existing health inequalities and decrease patient satisfaction (2_15).  Furthermore, rationing can erode public trust in the healthcare system, damaging the patient-physician relationship (2_5).

        "statements": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let\u2019s talk about healthcare.  Think about the last time you or a loved one needed medical attention.  Did you feel confident you\u2019d get the best possible care?  That\u2019s what we all deserve, right?  But what happens when resources are scarce?  The proposition argues for government intervention and rationing.  They say it\u2019s the fairest way, that it maximizes benefits for everyone.  But let\u2019s look closer.\n\n*First*, they claim government rationing ensures equitable allocation.  However, studies, like Mechanic\u2019s work on managed care published in *Health Affairs*, show that even when aiming for fairness, government rationing can erode public trust and damage the vital relationship between patients and doctors. This ultimately harms overall health outcomes.  Furthermore, a scoping review on rationing in healthcare, published in the *International Journal for Equity in Health*, highlights how implicit rationing through things like long wait times and limited clinic access disproportionately burdens vulnerable populations, making existing health disparities even worse. This directly contradicts the idea of equitable allocation.\n\n*Second*, the proposition suggests rationing, guided by protocols, maximizes lives saved.  But is it really that simple?  Think about it.  Resources are limited, potential for discrimination exists, and every human life has immense value. Articles like \u201cEthical rationing of healthcare resources during COVID-19 outbreak\u201d in the *The Lancet* and \u201cThe realities of rationing in health care\u201d in the *British Medical Journal* highlight the tough ethical choices rationing creates, even with guidelines.  Rationing doesn\u2019t guarantee saving the most lives and often comes at a steep ethical cost.\n\n*Third*, they claim government intervention fixes inequalities in market-based systems.  But let\u2019s be real, government rationing creates its own set of problems.  As we\u2019ve seen, it often disadvantages the most vulnerable, the opposite of equitable distribution.  Giving the government so much power also opens the door to potential misuse and bias in resource allocation, potentially marginalizing certain groups.\n\n*Fourth*, and this is crucial, rationing actually *worsens* existing health inequalities.  The article \"Rationing Limited Healthcare Resources in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond\" in *JAMA* shows how rationing strategies, especially those using age cutoffs, can deny essential care to older adults, violating anti-discrimination laws.  While the proposition talks about maximizing benefit by prioritizing those most likely to survive, this ignores the inherent value and rights of *every* individual.  Similarly, \u201cDisability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\u201d in the *Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics* shows how triage protocols can exclude people with disabilities from life-saving treatments, making their lives even harder.  This creates a two-tiered system, widening existing disparities.\n\n*Finally*, we offer a better way: prioritizing preventative care and public health.  Investing in things like vaccinations, health screenings, and education, as discussed in articles like \u201cThe Critical Role of Preventive Health in Reducing Employer Healthcare Costs\u201d in the *Harvard Business Review* and \u201cHow Preventive Care Lowers Health Care Costs\u201d published by the *RAND Corporation*, offers a higher return by tackling the root causes of disease and reducing the need for expensive treatments.  This proactive approach saves resources, improves overall health, and reduces health disparities \u2013 a more sustainable and equitable solution.\n\nSo, let\u2019s reject government rationing and support a fairer, more effective approach to healthcare. Let\u2019s invest in prevention and public health, building a healthier future for all of us.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.

The opposition has attempted to portray government intervention as a cold, calculating intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship.  We, however, maintain that a carefully designed system, guided by medical expertise and ethical principles, is not only justifiable but essential to maximizing societal benefit when faced with the difficult reality of scarcity.\n\nThe negative team mischaracterized rationing as a purely governmental dictate. Let\u2019s be clear: rationing, as we advocate, is a medically informed process, utilizing established triage protocols and ethical guidelines, empowering doctors to make the most effective decisions in challenging situations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, ventilator allocation protocols, guided by medical professionals, demonstrably saved lives (1).  These protocols, far from being arbitrary governmental dictates, reflect the best practices of emergency medicine, prioritizing those most likely to benefit from treatment.  Without such structured guidance, allocation becomes arbitrary, potentially favoring those with means over those most in need.\n\nFurthermore, the opposition\u2019s concerns about potential discrimination overlook the stark reality of existing inequalities in market-based healthcare systems.  Where access is determined by ability to pay, those without resources are inherently disadvantaged (2, 3). Government intervention, through transparent needs-based criteria, can mitigate these disparities. Programs like the UK's National Health Service demonstrate that equitable access is achievable through government involvement, prioritizing need over wealth (4).  A regulated system can actively address historical disadvantages, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the care they deserve. While the negative team raised the specter of implicit rationing harming vulnerable populations, they fail to distinguish this from the explicit, needs-based rationing we advocate, which is specifically designed to counteract those very disparities.\n\nFinally, the claim that government rationing undermines the doctor-patient relationship is a misdirection.  In reality, clear guidelines empower physicians to make ethically sound decisions in times of scarcity. These protocols are developed by medical experts, not politicians, providing a framework for navigating complex ethical dilemmas. The absence of such guidelines can lead to greater uncertainty and erode trust more significantly than a well-designed system.\n\nJustice demands that we prioritize those most in need when resources are limited.  Our approach affirms the fundamental value of every life by ensuring fair access to life-saving care, regardless of socioeconomic status. A market-driven system, on the other hand, inherently prioritizes those with means, leaving the most vulnerable behind.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

Arguments for Public Health Care Arguments for Private Health Care Examples US and the UK UK Healthcare spending as % of GDP rose from 4.5% in 1990 to just under 8% in 2010. This reflects a global trend to higher healthcare spending. Source:\u00a0Kings Fund\u00a0Rising health care spending is a global phenomenon. US healthcare costs The US healthcare has a strong element of private provision \u2013 with private insurance complemented by government programmes like Medicaid and Medicare. There is no universal right to healthcare. The US has the highest per capita expenditure on healthcare, but still, some people don\u2019t have proper access.

The problem is healthcare will never be free. Whether its run by government or the private sector it will always cost money. The problem is whether or not you would like to be able to pick and choose what services you would like and what quality of care you would like to receive. The biggest point in the article is that the private sector has incentives to provide the best quality care possible while if it was operated by the government, individual healthcare workers lose many competitive factors that drive their efficiency to the maximum. The only positive is that healthcare becomes available to all people rather than to only those who can afford it. I believe the obvious fix to this is to have the government provide it for those who cant afford it but never force those who can afford to pay for their own onto their system. This would retain the free market competitiveness to increase efficiency while stil",

They play by the rules, work hard just like the rest of Americans, and yet they can't get insurance from the employer because it's not offered, or they can't afford it if it is offered. Is that their fault? \u2022 Is it really anyone's fault that health insurance is so expensive that they can't afford it? The high costs of health care are due to influences beyond any one individual's control - they are influenced by society-wide trends towards increased use of technology, high administrative costs of our healthcare system, and a strong profit motive in the health insurance industry that drives up the cost of premiums. The uninsured should take more individual responsibility to get insurance. It\u2019s not our responsibility to give them insurance. \u2022 A small percentage of the uninsured can afford insurance but choose not to obtain it. Most of these are young, healthy individuals. Should these people go to the ER or become hospitalized, their medical bills may become so great that they can't afford to pay it, in which case the hospital often writes off all or part of their bill as \"uncompensated care.\" In so doing, government and individuals with private insurance end up subsidizing the cost of care for these people, who essentially become \"free-riders\" off the system. \u2022 For the vast majority of the uninsured, however, inability to afford health insurance, and not a conscious choice, is the reason they are uninsured. It's fine to say that people should take individual responsibility if they can afford to carry out that responsibility. Since this is not the case for the majority of the uninsured, it becomes ridiculous to argue that the problem of uninsurance can be solved with simple individu",

While the number of Americans without health insurance has dropped significantly due to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, nearly 30 million Americans remain without health coverage and experience limited access to health care. This considerable figure should be of tremendous moral concern, as studies have shown that tens of thousands of Americans die each year due to this lack of health coverage. Additionally, universal health coverage would promote fairness, equality and greater transparency and accountability concerning access to health care.

By Roosa Tikkanen and Robin Osborn The Commonwealth Fund, July 11, 2019 As recent congressional hearings on Medicare for All proposals have illustrated, members of Congress and presidential candidates are looking outside the United States to find ways to achieve universal coverage. Some have suggested that other countries are able to provide universal coverage because they \u201cration\u201d care \u2014 a term rife with negative connotations. This post examines the extent to which health care is rationed in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom \u2014 as compared to the U.S. Examples of health care rationing tend to focus on long wait times for procedures \u2014such as hip replacements, or MRIs \u2014 or limited access to the newest drugs. This happens in some (but not all) countries and can be a challenge for policymakers. But there are other ways in which health systems engage in rationing, by restricting access to insurance, through insurance benefit design, or by imposing high patient cost-sharing. While other countries may ration because of national budget constraints and supply-side factors, the United States\u2019 lack of access to comprehensive insurance and affordable care represent a de facto form of rationing that leads people to delay getting care or going without it entirely. Getting in the Door In the five European countries we examined, all residents are entitled to health care through the national system. These range from tax-funded systems in Sweden or the U.K. to private insurance-based systems in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In the latter, governments regulate premiums to be affordable and provide income-related subsidies to low-income families, which include 27 percent of Swiss and 30 percent of Dutch residents. Governments also mandate generous benefit packages that typically guarantee a minimum set of services: primary, specialty, and hospital care; prescription drugs; ment",

                      "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Citation PDF Altmetric Abstract A principal component of physician decision making is judging what interventions are clinically appropriate. Due to the inexorable and steady increase of health care costs in the US, physicians are constantly being urged to exercise judicious financial stewardship with due regard for the financial implications of what they prescribe. When applied on a case-by-case basis, this otherwise reasonable approach can lead to either inadvertent or overt and arbitrary restriction of interventions for some patients rather than others on the basis of clinically irrelevant characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, or skin color. In the absence of systemwide reform in which the resources saved from one patient or group of patients are reallocated for the benefit of others, prudence is urged in the application of \u201cbedside rationing.\u201d Case Mr. J is a 58-year-old black man who has been mostly homeless for the past eight years. He has a number of chronic medical conditions of which end-stage renal failure is his most critical. He has been receiving hemodialysis for six years. Because he does not have health insurance and is not eligible for Medicaid in the state in which he resides, Medicare covers many of the costs associated with care for his kidney disease under the end-stage renal disease benefit. Mr. J is not a known substance abuser but does have significant mental health issues and has preferred to live on the streets rather than in the shelters and the halfway houses to which he has been assigned",

During the last week of December, the CDC recorded a record of 225,269 new coronavirus cases and 118,948 total hospitalizations. Health care systems across the country have predicted that they soon may face shortages of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other limited resources. In Utah, for example, hospital administrators have implemented informal triage protocols that prioritize patients based on health status, clinical factors, and the time sensitivity of their needed procedures. Hospitals in California have similarly begun rationing care. If these dire circumstances worsen, hospital systems may apply triage protocols that deviate from best practices and impermissibly discriminate against people with disabilities. Disability rights advocates have warned that triage policies might result in unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities. It is neither morally nor legally permissible for medical personnel to deny life-sustaining care on the basis of stereotypes about disability. To prevent unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities, federal agencies should issue a detailed, nationalized model triage policy and encourage state adoption of such guidance. Such guidance should help prevent disability discrimination by providing specific protections, delineating individualized assessments, and prohibiting discriminatory exclusions. \u201cRuthless Utilitarianism\u201d: Disability Discrimination in Early Triage Protocols In the spring of 2020, as health care systems across the country prepared to respond to rationing decisions in the COVID-19 pandemic, many of the earliest triage guidelines and policies adopted by hospitals called for categorical discrimination against people with disabilities.

While resource allocation decision\u2010making frameworks have been developed, or adapted, to govern the unprecedented impacts of the pandemic, access to health care may, now and in the future, be restricted in ways previously unimaginable. While the broader community may accept the need for rationing, individuals denied COVID\u201019 or other care might look to the law to protect their interests.

Citation PDF Altmetric Abstract A principal component of physician decision making is judging what interventions are clinically appropriate. Due to the inexorable and steady increase of health care costs in the US, physicians are constantly being urged to exercise judicious financial stewardship with due regard for the financial implications of what they prescribe. When applied on a case-by-case basis, this otherwise reasonable approach can lead to either inadvertent or overt and arbitrary restriction of interventions for some patients rather than others on the basis of clinically irrelevant characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, or skin color. In the absence of systemwide reform in which the resources saved from one patient or group of patients are reallocated for the benefit of others, prudence is urged in the application of \u201cbedside rationing.\u201d Case Mr. J is a 58-year-old black man who has been mostly homeless for the past eight years. He has a number of chronic medical conditions of which end-stage renal failure is his most critical. He has been receiving hemodialysis for six years.

Perry, Christian Guillermet Fern\u00e1ndez, David Fern\u00e1ndez Puyana Abstract Since 2008, the UN Human Rights Council has been working on a declaration related to the right to peace. The Council has established an Open-Ended Working Group, which is refining the draft declaration. This paper discusses the relationship between the right to health and the right to life in peace; we argue that peace and the conditions that support peace are essential to realize the right to health. Health professionals have an important role to play in promoting the right to a life in peace. We suggest that human dignity, as foundational to all human rights as well as health professionals\u2019 codes of ethics, provides a normative basis for the progressive realization of both the rights to health and to life in peace.

All WHO Member States have ratified at least one international human rights treaty that includes the right to the highest attainable standard of health.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0After ratifying a treaty, a country has a legal obligation to protect and fulfil the rights recognized in the treaty. To deliver on binding human rights commitments countries need to adopt a human rights-based approach to health. Health and human rights The right to the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health is enshrined in several international legal instruments including the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It includes freedoms and entitlements. Freedoms include the right to control one\u2019s health and body (for example, sexual and reproductive rights) and to be free from interference (for example, free from torture and non-consensual medical treatment and experimentation, particularly relevant for persons with disabilities). Entitlements include the right to access quality health services without any discrimination.\u00a0 A human rights-based approach to health commits countries to develop rights-compliant, effective, gender transformative, integrated, accountable health systems and implement other public health measures that improve the underlying determinants of health, like access to water and sanitation.\u00a0 This means countries must ensure legislation and health policies and programmes respect and advance the realization of human rights. Research shows that proactive measures to comply with human rights obligations help countries improve substantive equality and build resilience to shocks. For example, applying a human rights framework to reproductive health can help us identify how preventable maternal mortality and morbidity results from a variety of human rights violations including discrimination and lack of access to quality health services.

In fact, more than half of the world's countries have some degree of a guaranteed, specific right to public health and medical care for their citizens written into their national constitutions. The United States is one of 86 countries whose constitutions do not guarantee their citizens any kind of health protection. That's the finding of a new study from the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health that examined the level and scope of constitutional protection of specific rights to public health and medical care, as well as the broad right to health. The study examined the constitutions of all United Nations member states and found the results to be mixed, despite the fact that all U.N. members have universally recognized the right to health, which is written into the original foundational document establishing the international body in 1948.The researchers reviewed the constitutions of all the member states as amended to two points in time: August 2007 and June 2011. The report appears in the July issue of the journal Global Public Health. The study also calls for regular and long-term monitoring of all countries' protection of health rights, whether or not such rights are written into specific country's constitutions. That's because a constitutional definition of what health protection actually is varies widely between nations. Further, how such protections have been implemented varies widely, said the study's first author, Dr. Jody Heymann, dean of the Fielding School of Public Health. \"With respect to specific rights to health, the status of the world's constitutions can be described as either half empty or half full,\" Heymann said. The study found that 73 U.N. member countries (38 percent) guaranteed the right to medical care services, while 27 (14 percent) aspired to protect this right in 2011.

This article examines the level and scope of constitutional protection of specific rights to public health and medical care, as well as the broad right to health. We analysed health rights in the constitutions of 191 UN countries in 2007 and 2011. We examined how rights protections varied across the year of constitutional adoption; national income group and region; and for vulnerable groups within each country. A minority of the countries guaranteed the rights to public health (14%), medical care (38%) and overall health (36%) in their constitutions in 2011. Free medical care was constitutionally protected in 9% of the countries. Thirteen per cent of the constitutions guaranteed children's right to health or medical care, 6% did so for persons with disabilities and 5% for each of the elderly and the socio-economically disadvantaged. Valuable next steps include regular monitoring of the national protection of health rights recognised in international agreements, analyses of the imp",

Abstract Panel data from 157 countries, between 1970 and 2007, were used to study the associations between introducing an explicit and enforceable right to health into national constitutions and subsequent reductions in neonatal, infant, and maternal mortality and the probability of dying for adult women. The introduction of a right to health in a national constitution was significantly associated with subsequent reductions in neonatal and infant mortality rates. However, it was not associated with reductions in maternal mortality ratios and the probability of dying for adult women. The reduction in neonatal and infant mortality rates was large in countries with high scores for democratic governance, but approximately half as great in countries with low scores for democratic governance. The results suggest that introducing a constitutional right to health is likely to be an effective mechanism for improving infant health in countries with a high level of democratic governance. This health benefit is not seen in m",

Skip to content American Bar Association TM American Bar Association Civil Rights & Social Justice HOME Health Care As a Human Right The only remedy to our lack of access to health care is to stop confusing health insurance with health care. Health is not a commodity; it is a right. There are rights to which we are entitled, simply by virtue of our humanity. Human rights exist independent of our culture, religion, race, nationality, or economic status. Only by the free exercise of those rights can we enjoy a life of dignity. Among all the rights to which we are entitled, health care may be the most intersectional and crucial. The very frailty of our human lives demands that we protect this right as a public good. Universal health care is crucial to the ability of the most marginalized segments of any population to live lives of dignity. Without our health we\u00e2\u0080\u0094literally\u00e2\u0080\u0094do not live, let alone live with dignity.\u00a0 In the United States, we cannot enjoy the right to health care. Our country has a system designed to deny, not support, the right to health. The United States does not really have a health care system, only a health insurance system. Our government champions human rights around the world, insisting that other countries protect human rights, even imposing sanctions for a failure to do so. Our government is not as robust in protecting rights at home. The right to health care has long been recognized internationally. Ironically, the origins of this right are here in the United States. Health care was listed in the Second Bill of Rights drafted by Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR). Sadly, FDR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death kept this Second Bill of Rights from being implemented. Eleanor Roosevelt, however, took his work to the United Nations (UN), where it was expanded and clarified. She became the drafting chairperson for the UN\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Unive",

Some immediate obligations for countries include the guarantees of non-discrimination and equal treatment in health. The right to health includes entitlements, such as the right to control one\u2019s health, informed consent, bodily integrity, and participation in health-related decision-making. It also includes freedoms, like freedom from torture, ill-treatment and harmful practices. The right to health is closely related to and dependent on the realization of other human rights, including the rights to life, food, housing, work, education, privacy, access to information, freedom from torture and the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. It includes both nondiscriminatory access to quality, timely and appropriate health services and systems and to the underlying determinants of health.\u00a0 A human rights-based approach (HRBA) aims to support sustainable development by addressing inequalities, discriminatory practices and unjust power relations that are often at the core of unequal outcomes. HRBA focuses on the groups of people who are most marginalized and discriminated against. The United Nations common understanding of a HRBA serves as a guiding framework. It has the following elements. Goal: All programmes, policies and technical assistance should further the realization of the right to health and other health-related human rights.

Overall health care United States Healthcare rationing in the United States of America is largely accomplished through market forces, though major government programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and the Indian Health Service. Most Americans have private health insurance, and non-emergency health care rationing decisions are made based on what the insurance company or government insurance will pay for, what the patient is willing to pay for (though health care prices are often not transparent), and the ability and willingness of the provider to perform uncompensated care. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 requires any properly equipped hospital receiving Medicare funds (nearly all private hospitals) to provide emergency healthcare regardless of citizenship, immigration status, or ability to pay. The government also regulates insurance policies, requiring coverage for some items and controlling the rules for who is eligible and what they can be charged.[1] The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (known as the PPACA or Obamacare) contained many changes to these regulations, including the first requirement that all Americans purchase health insurance (starting in 2014), which significantly changed the calculus of rationing decisions, including for preventive care. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) sets coverage requirements for the National Health Service (NHS), which is funded and operated by the government. NICE calculates an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALY). Treatments under \u00a320,000 per QALY gained are considered cost-effective, but those above \u00a330,000 per QALY are rarely approved. Individuals who are able to do so may also pay for private treatments beyond what the NHS offers, but low-income people large",

Overall health care [edit] United States [edit] Main article: Healthcare rationing in the United States Healthcare rationing in the United States of America is largely accomplished through market forces, though major government programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and the Indian Health Service. Most Americans have private health insurance, and non-emergency health care rationing decisions are made based on what the insurance company or government insurance will pay for, what the patient is willing to pay for (though health care prices are often not transparent), and the ability and willingness of the provider to perform uncompensated care. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 requires any properly equipped hospital receiving Medicare funds (nearly all private hospitals) to provide emergency healthcare regardless of",

Citation PDF Altmetric Abstract A principal component of physician decision making is judging what interventions are clinically appropriate. Due to the inexorable and steady increase of health care costs in the US, physicians are constantly being urged to exercise judicious financial stewardship with due regard for the financial implications of what they prescribe. When applied on a case-by-case basis, this otherwise reasonable approach can lead to either inadvertent or overt and arbitrary restriction of interventions for some patients rather than others on the basis of clinically irrelevant characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, or skin color. In the absence of systemwide reform in which the resources saved from one patient or group of patients are reallocated for the benefit of others, prudence is urged in the application of \u201cbedside rationing.\u201d Case Mr. J is a 58-year-old black man who has been mostly homeless for the past eight years. He has a number of chronic medical conditions of which end-stage renal failure is his most critical. He has been receiving hemodialysis for six years. Because he does not have health insurance and is not eligible for Medicaid in the state in which he resides, Medicare covers many of the costs associated with care for his kidney disease under the end-stage renal disease benefit. Mr. J is not a known substance abuser but does have significant mental health issues and has preferred to live on the streets rather than in the shelters and the halfway houses to which he has been assigned",

Received 2020 Jul 10; Revised 2020 Aug 14; Accepted 2020 Aug 17; Collection date 2020 Dec. Abstract The current public health crisis has exposed deep cracks in social equality and justice for marginalised and vulnerable communities around the world. The reported rise in the number of \u2018do not resuscitate\u2019 orders being imposed on people with disabilities has caused particular concerns from a human rights perspective. While the evidence of this is contested, this article will consider the human rights implications at stake and the dangers associated with using \u2018quality of life\u2019 measures as determinant of care in medical decision-making and triage assessments. Keywords: Disability rights, Medical necessity, Right to dignity, Medical treatment Introduction At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, there were concerns about how health services would cope with the rising numbers of patients in a critical condition, thereby leading to the question of how patients with disabilities might be \u2018triaged\u2019 under insufficient ventilators or staff (Bagenstos 2020). Vulnerable members of society, including older persons and people with disabilities, were seen as being most at risk, and healthcare professionals were advised to prioritise those who had the best chance of recovery in the event of a mass outbreak. These attitudes and approaches raise complex ethical and legal questions which challenge our commitment to human rights and equality. There are further concerns about the appropriateness of resorting to a utilitarian model",

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases. Concrete and pragmatic regulations and guidelines for systematic rationing have to be framed and followed. In addition, physicians being sensitive and empowered on deciding bedside rationing in coordination with the recommendations of ethicists and healthcare officials, will ensure fair practice.

During the last week of December, the CDC recorded a record of 225,269 new coronavirus cases and 118,948 total hospitalizations. Health care systems across the country have predicted that they soon may face shortages of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other limited resources. In Utah, for example, hospital administrators have implemented informal triage protocols that prioritize patients based on health status, clinical factors, and the time sensitivity of their needed procedures. Hospitals in California have similarly begun rationing care. If these dire circumstances worsen, hospital systems may apply triage protocols that deviate from best practices and impermissibly discriminate against people with disabilities. Disability rights advocates have warned that triage policies might result in unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities. It is neither morally nor legally permissible for medical personnel to deny life-sustaining care on the basis of stereotypes about disability. To prevent unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities, federal agencies should issue a detailed, nationalized model triage policy and encourage state adoption of such guidance. Such guidance should help prevent disability discrimination by providing specific protections, delineating individualized assessments, and prohibiting discriminatory exclusions. \u201cRuthless Utilitarianism\u201d: Disability Discrimination in Early Triage Protocols",

Prioritizing patients with the greatest prognosis is advocated for healthcare practitioners. Due to the increased pressures on limited resources distribution, COVID-19 caused much controversy about the possible consequences of healthcare rationing. COVID-19 exposed hospitals to difficulties in emergency decision-making and made it evident that funding is necessary to be spent on hospital resources, such as equipment, medication, and the employment of more staff. For that matter, this paper is designed to claim that healthcare rationing is problematic because it leads to various types of discrimination against marginalized and disadvantaged populations due to the use of color-blind criteria. Healthcare Rationing and Its Occurrence Health service rationing entails limiting some people\u2019s access to essential healthcare services due to resource constraints. Although \u201ctreating patients equally should be a central goal of medicine,\u201d it is not always possible due to the limited capacity of the healthcare systems in times of emergencies (Schmidt et al., 2021, p. 126). Healthcare rationing occurs when insufficient supplies and excessive demand for resources such as equipment and a low number of hospital staff make it difficult to provide healthcare to everyone who requires it (Fink, 2020). When the number of patients exceeds the number of available means, hospital staff must \u201cdecide which ones would get the lifesaving resources,\u201d leaving some \u2018unlucky\u2019 patients without chances for survival (Fink, 2020, p. 1). Thus, when pressured by the dilemmas of whom to save, hospitals refer to triage practices, which obstruct the opportunities of providing equal care to all.

Phone 617-632-9810. Fax 617-632-9820. kladin@post.harvard.edu Issue date 2011 Nov. Abstract After six years of deliberation, the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network recently released a concept document proposing changes to the kidney allocation algorithm, sparking a heated debate about priority-setting of scarce health resources and discrimination. Proponents of the proposal argue that it will result in an additional 15,223 life years following transplant annually for recipients, yet the benefit will not be equally distributed and will likely benefit younger patients. Critics argue the new model will promote age discrimination and may lead to a further decrease in live kidney donation. If true, these concerns could undermine fairness and damage public trust in the organ allocation system. We address these objections and consider their merit, highlighting both benefits and shortcomings of the proposal. We argue that, despite weaknesses of the proposal and the importance of maintaining consistency in patient and provider expectations over time, the proposal represents a needed first step in balancing equity and efficiency.

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

During the last week of December, the CDC recorded a record of 225,269 new coronavirus cases and 118,948 total hospitalizations. Health care systems across the country have predicted that they soon may face shortages of ventilators, personal protective equipment (PPE), and other limited resources. In Utah, for example, hospital administrators have implemented informal triage protocols that prioritize patients based on health status, clinical factors, and the time sensitivity of their needed procedures. Hospitals in California have similarly begun rationing care. If these dire circumstances worsen, hospital systems may apply triage protocols that deviate from best practices and impermissibly discriminate against people with disabilities. Disability rights advocates have warned that triage policies might result in unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities. It is neither morally nor legally permissible for medical personnel to deny life-sustaining care on the basis of stereotypes about disability. To prevent unlawful discrimination against people with disabilities, federal agencies should issue a detailed, nationalized model triage policy and encourage state adoption of such guidance. Such guidance should help prevent disability discrimination by providing specific protections, delineating individualized assessments, and prohibiting discriminatory exclusions. \u201cRuthless Utilitarianism\u201d: Disability Discrimination in Early Triage Protocols",

Shortages of necessary medical equipment to treat COVID-19 have prompted triage guidelines outlining the ways in which lifesaving equipment, such as mechanical ventilators and intensive care unit beds, may need to be rationed among affected individuals. In this article, we explore the realities of medical rationing, and various approaches to triage and prioritization. We discuss the psychology of ableism, perceptions about quality of life, social determinants of health, and how attitudes toward disability can affect rationing decisions and access to care. In addition to the grassroots advocacy and activism undertaken by the disability community, psychology is rich in its contributions to the role of attitudes, prejudice, and discriminatory behavior on the social fabric of society.

While medical breakthroughs and improved access to care have benefited many, there are still profound gaps in health outcomes, quality of care and access to essential services for these communities.\u00a0 These disparities disproportionately affect minority populations, low-income individuals and other vulnerable groups, such as the ALICE population, leading to significant health inequities. ALICE stands for Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed and represents the nearly 500,000 households in the National Capital Area who earn above the Federal Poverty Line, but still cannot afford to meet their basic needs. Read on to better understand health disparities and learn how we can achieve a more equitable health care system that provides equal opportunities for all individuals to attain optimal health and well-being. Health Disparities Definition According to the CDC, health disparities are preventable differences in the burden of disease, injury, violence or opportunities to achieve optimal health that socially disadvantaged populations experience. One way to understand health disparities is through United Way of the National Capital Area\u2019s ALICE Reports. ALICE individuals and families work but struggle to afford necessities such as housing, food, childcare, health care and transportation. ALICE Reports provide valuable insights into the financial challenges faced by these individuals and the impact of those challenges on their health. Numerous factors contribute to health disparities, and socioeconomic status plays a significant role. Socioeconomic factors, such as income, education, occupation and housing, influence an individual\u2019s ability to access quality health care services.\u00a0 Those with lower socioeconomic statu",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing.

Objective Identify and synthesize strategies or interventions that facilitate the reduction of health inequalities. Methods A systematic search strategy was carried out up until August 2019 in MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, LILACS, Scopus, Scielo and Epistemonikos. In addition, a snowball strategy was used. Literature reviews (LRs) of experimental and quasi-experimental studies were included. The identified interventions and outcomes were categorized based on the recommendation by the Cochrane group in \u201cEffective Practice and Organization of Care\u201d. The quality of the included LRs was evaluated using the AMSTAR 2 tool. Results Four thousand ninety-five articles were identified, of which 97 were included in the synthesis of evidence. Most of the studies included focused on the general population, vulnerable populations and minority populations. The subjects of general health and healthy lifestyles were the most commonly addressed. According to the classification of the type of intervention, the domain covered most was the delivery arrangements, followed by the domain of implementation strategies. The most frequent group of outcomes was the reported outcome in (clinical) patients, followed by social outcomes. Conclusion The strategies that facilitate the reduction of health inequalities must be intersectoral and multidisciplinary in nature, including all sectors of the health system. It is essential to continue generating interventions focused on strengthening health systems in order to achieve adequate universal health coverage, with a process of comprehensive and qu",

An analysis of disenfranchised, vulnerable, and marginalized groups identifies critical factors such as social determinants of health and structural violence, which are vital contributors to healthcare disparities and inequities in the United States and globally. There is a particular focus on vulnerable groups such as migrant workers, indigenous peoples, individuals with chronic mental health conditions,\u00a0homeless, and immigrant communities. The pertinence of addressing healthcare disparities between the general population and these vulnerable groups is discussed, along with recommendations for reducing inequality.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Until recently, rationing was primarily through the ability to pay or achieved implicitly by doctors working within fixed budgets. Such forms of rationing are commonly alleged to be inequitable and inefficient and explicit rationing is advocated as more appropriate. Utilisation management in the United States and quasimarkets separating purchasing from provision in the United Kingdom are seen as ways of using resources more efficiently and are increasingly explicit. There is also advocacy to ration explicitly at the point of service. Mechanic reviews the implications of these developments and explains why explicit approaches are likely to focus conflict and dissatisfaction and be politically unstable. Explicit rationing is unlikely to be as equitable as its proponents argue and is likely to make dissatisfaction and perceived deprivation more salient. Despite its limitations, implicit rationing at the point of service is more sensitive to the complexity of medical decisions and the needs and personal and cultural preferences of patients. All systems use a mix of rationing devices, but the clinical allocation of services should substantially depend on the discretion of professionals informed by practice guidelines, outcomes research, and other informational aids. Medical care has always been rationed by the supply available, by its distribution, and by the public's ability to pay. As medical care has become more important in people's lives, and as its capacity to impact on health has grown, government has taken increasing responsibility either for providing medical services directly or for mandating them through an insurance system. Governments in all nations seek means to limit public expenditure and mandates for health services. Explicit approaches i",

Implicit rationing care occurs at the nurse-to-patient level (micro-level), and nurses are direct participants. Therefore, the strategies based on experience of nurses to reduce implicit rationing care have more reference value and promotion significance. The aim of the study is to explore the experience of nurses to reduce implicit rationing care, thereby to provide references for conducting randomized controlled trials to reduce implicit rationing care. Methods This is a descriptive phenomenological study. Purpose sampling was conducted nationwide. There are 17 nurses were selected and semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed via thematic analysis. Results Our study found that nurses\u2019 reported experience of coping with implicit rationing of nursing care contained three aspects: personal, resource, and managerial. Three themes were extracted from the results of the study: (1) improving personal literacy; (2) supplying and optimizing resources and (3) standardizing management mode. The improvement of nurses\u2019 own qualities are the prerequisites, the supply and optimization of resources is an effective strategy, and clear scope of work has attracted the attention of nurses. Conclusion The experience of dealing with implicit nursing rationing includes many aspects. Nursing managers should be grounded in nurses\u2019 perspectives when developing strategies to reduce implicit rationing of nursing care. Promoting the improvement of nurses\u2019 skills, improving staffing level and optimizing scheduling mode are promising measures to reduce hidden nursing rationing. Peer Revi",

As healthcare resources become scarce, hospitals and other healthcare institutions move through the continuum of care from conventional care, to contingency care, to crisis care. This guidance seeks to remind the healthcare community of their ongoing obligations to render healthcare in an ethical and non-discriminatory manner, obligations that are even more critical when providers are operating beyond their capacity. Healthcare institutions and providers must ensure effective protocols are in place in order to support the delivery of ethical, non-discriminatory decisions, especially those related to the allocation and rationing of limited healthcare resources. It is essential that healthcare institutions operate within an ethical framework and consistent with civil rights laws that prohibit discrimination in the delivery of healthcare. Specifically, in allocating healthcare resources or services during public health emergencies, healthcare institutions are prohibited from using factors including, but not limited to race, ethnicity, sex, gender identity, national origin, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, age, and disability. Assumptions or stereotypes based on these characteristics serve no meaningful purpose in differentiating between people in the context of healthcare allocation decisions, and as further detailed below, are unacceptable both from an ethical standpoint, and as a matter of civil rights law. Significant legal protections are in place to prohibit discrimination in the delivery of healthcare. Healthcare providers in the United States are subject to nondiscrimination mandates. Specifically, federal civil rights laws, including Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act, Section",

Abstract Health justice as a movement incorporates research about how to more effectively leverage law, policy, and institutions to dismantle inequitable power distributions and accompanying patterns of marginalization that are root causes of health inequity. Legal advocacy is key to health justice because it addresses patients\u2019 health-harming legal needs in housing, public benefits, employment, education, immigration, domestic violence, and other areas of law. In medical-legal partnerships, lawyers and clinicians are uniquely positioned to jointly identify and remove legal barriers to patients\u2019 health, advocate for structural reform, and build community power. Case JM is 29 years of age and presents in distress to a municipal emergency department with an acute asthma exacerbation for the third time this month. JM is admitted and seen by a hospitalist, Dr H, who learns from JM that he is living in an apartment with mold and fears being evicted after falling behind on rent. Dr H is concerned that JM will continue to experience severe asthma exacerbations and overall poor health if he remains in substandard and unstable housing. Commentary Dr H is rightfully concerned about JM\u2019s health. Exposure to mold in homes has been linked to increased incidence and severity of asthma.1,2,3 If JM were to be evicted, his health would be further at risk, as eviction has been linked to myriad health conditions.4 Indeed, even the threat of eviction has been shown to harm health.5 On her own, Dr H lacks the tools in her toolbox to address JM\u2019s substandard housing conditions or prevent his eviction. JM is experiencing health-harming legal needs and requires legal advocacy both to ensure that his landlord remediates the mold in his home in accordance with the local housing code and to prevent his eviction.6,7 Each year, millions of Americans\u2014and disproportionately people with low-income and people of color\u2014have unmet lega",

Abstract Background Several quantitative surveys have been conducted internationally to gather empirical information about physicians\u2019 general attitudes towards health care rationing. Are physicians ready to accept and implement rationing, or are they rather reluctant? Do they prefer implicit bedside rationing that allows the physician\u2013patient relationship broad leeway in individual decisions? Or do physicians prefer strategies that apply explicit criteria and rules? Objectives To analyse the range of survey findings on rationing. To discuss differences in response patterns. To provide recommendations for the enhancement of transparency and systematic conduct in reviewing survey literature. Methods A systematic search was performed for all English and non-English language references using CINAHL, EMBASE, and MEDLINE. Three blinded experts independently evaluated title and abstract of each reference. Survey items were extracted that match with: (i) willingness to ration health care or (ii) preferences for different rationing strategies. Results 16 studies were eventually included in the systematic review. Percentages of respondents willing to accept rationing ranged from 94% to 9%. Conclusions The conflicting findings",

Abstract Trust in physicians has declined, and surveys of public opinion show a poor level of public trust in physicians. Commodification of health care has been speculated as a plausible driving force. We used cross-national data of 23 countries from the International Social Survey Programme 2011 to quantify health care commodification and study its role in the trust that patients generally place in physicians. A modified health care index was used to quantify health care commodification. There were 34 968 respondents. A question about the level of general trust in physicians and a 4-item \u201cgeneral trust in physicians\u201d scale were used as our major and minor outcomes.

The Missing Links Affiliations How Public Trust in Health Care Can Shape Patient Overconsumption in Health Systems? The Missing Links Authors Affiliations Abstract Overconsumption of health care is an ever-present and complex problem in health systems. It is especially significant in countries in transition that assign relatively small budgets to health care. In these circumstances, trust in the health system and its institutions is of utmost importance. Many researchers have studied interpersonal trust. Relatively less attention, however, has been paid to public trust in health systems and its impact on overconsumption. Therefore, this paper seeks to identify and examine the link between public trust and the moral hazard experienced by the patient with regard to health care consumption. Moreover, it explores the mediating role of patient satisfaction and patient non-adherence. For these purposes, quantitative research was conducted based on a representative sample of patients in Poland. Interesting findings were made on the issues examined. Patients were shown not to overconsume health care if they trusted the system and were satisfied with their doctor-patient relationship. On the other hand, nonadherence to medical recommendations was shown to increase overuse of medical services. The present study contributes to the existing knowledge by",

In this health economic climate, personalized medicine promises not only an improvement in healthcare delivery but also the possibility of more cost-effective therapies. It is important to remember, however, that personalized medicine has the potential to both increase and decrease costs. Each targeted therapy must be evaluated individually. However, standard clinical trial design is not suitable for personalized therapies. Therefore, both scientists and regulatory authorities will need to accept innovative study designs in order to validate personalized therapies. Hence correct economic evaluations are difficult to carry out due to lack of clear clinical evidence, longitudinal accounting and experience with patient/clinician behavior in the context of personalized medicine. In terms of reimbursement, payers, pharmaceutical companies and companion diagnostic manufacturers will also need to explore creative risk-sharing concepts. Germany is no exception to the challenges that face personalized medicine and for personalized medicine to really become the future of medicine many health econo",

Email: muir.gray@medknox.netThis article is part of the series on population healthcare. Issue date 2018 Feb. Personalised or individualised healthcare and population healthcare are two sides of one coin. It follows that those responsible for developing population healthcare cannot ignore the individual. The first reason we cannot separate the individual from the population is that everyone involved in managing health services has an ethical duty to think of the individual. This principle was first enunciated in 1789 by Jeremy Bentham in his classic book An Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, in which he wrote \u2018It is in vain to talk of the interests of the community without understanding what is the interest of the individual\u2019.1 The second reason is that the value for each individual changes just like the value for the population as the investment in a service increases so people who make decisions about populations, for example to increase investment in a particular service change the nature of the clinical decisions made by individual clinicians and patients too. In Explorations in Quality Assessment and Monitoring,2 Donabedian described not only the concept of structure, process and outcome but also his \u2018unifying model of benefit, risk and cost\u2019. The power of this model is that it quantifies for the first time the relationship between resources invested in healthcare and the amount of value obtained from that level of investment. Donabedian showed that as healthcare resources are increased, ben",

It has been portrayed as precision medicine, targeting with deadly accuracy cancer cells and sparing patients the debilitating broad-spectrum side effects of more traditional forms of cancer therapy. But personalized medicine still has its costs to patients and society, both moral and economic costs. How to recognize and address those issues will be the focus of this essay. We start with these questions: Does everyone faced with cancer have a moral right to the most effective cancer care available, no matter what the cost, no matter whether a particular individual has the personal ability to pay for that care or not? Or are there limits to the cancer care that anyone has a right to at social expense? If so, what are those limits and how are those limits to be determined? Are those limits a matter of both morality and economics? I will answer this last question in the affirmative. This is what I refer to as the \"Just Caring\" problem in health care.

In ancient times, Hippocrates combined an assessment of the four humors \u2014 blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile \u2014 to determine the best course of treatment for each patient. Today, the sequence of the four chemical building blocks that comprise DNA, coupled with telltale proteins in the blood, enable more accurate medical predictions. The Personalized Medicine Report 5 INTRODUCTION When it comes to medicine, one size does not fit all. Treatments and prevention strategies that help some patients are ineffective for others, 1 and the same medicine may cause side effects or adverse reactions in only certain patients. Yet physicians usually recommend medical inter\u00ad ventions based on what works best for patients on average.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Rationing of nursing care (RONC) refers to necessary nursing tasks that nurses refuse or fail to do because of limited time, staffing level, or skill mix. As an important process factor, it affects the quality of patient care. The concept of rationing of nursing care has not yet been clearly defined and analyzed and there are different views regarding this issue. Using Walker and Avant's eight-step method, this concept analysis was conducted to analyze the meaning, attributes, dimensions, antecedents, and consequences of nursing care rationing. The literature was collected by searching in electronic databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar with no date limitation. Both qualitative and quantitative studies on rationing of nursing care, which were open-access and published in English, were included in this study. Thirty-three articles were investigated in the present study. The four defining attributes of RONC included the duty of performing nursing care, dealing with problems of doing nursing care, decision-making and prioritizing, and outcome. The antecedents included nurse-related, organization-related, care-related, and patient-related antecedents. A theoretical definition and a conceptual model of RONC were developed.",

All decisions made in the care of patients with kidney disease can potentially be explored through SDM. Adoption of SDM in routine kidney care faces numerous institutional and practical barriers. Patients with chronic disease who have become accustomed to paternalistic care may need support to engage in SDM\u2014even though most patients actively want more involvement in decisions about their care. Nephrologists often underestimate the risks and overestimate the benefits of investigations and treatments and often default to recommending burdensome treatments rather than discussing prognosis openly. Guideline bodies continue to issue recommendations written for healthcare professionals without providing patient decision aids. To mitigate health inequalities, care needs to be taken to provide SDM to all patients, not just the highly health-literate pa",

A service of the National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health. Shared decision making NICE Guideline, No. 197 This guideline is the basis of QS15. Overview This guideline covers how to make shared decision making part of everyday care in all healthcare settings. It promotes ways for healthcare professionals and people using services to work together to make decisions about treatment and care. It includes recommendations on training, communicating risks, benefits and consequences, using decision aids, and how to embed shared decision making in organisational culture and practices. The guideline does not cover unexpected emergencies in which immediate life-saving care is needed. It also does not cover situations when, at the time a decision needs to be made, an adult does not have mental capacity to make a decision about their healthcare. For more information, see the NICE guideline on decision-making and mental capacity. Who is it for? It may also be relevant for: Social care practitionersVoluntary, community and social enterprise organisationsPeople who use social care services Recommendations Shared decision making is a collaborative process that involves a person and their healthcare professional working together to reach a joint decision about care. It could be care the person needs straightaway or care in the future, for example, through advance care planning. See the full definition of shared decision making.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted.

Corresponding Author: Anu Kant Mital E-mail: akmital@gmail.com Introduction Healthcare rationing for elderly is an unfinished agenda in bioethics. It has gained momentum in recent years especially in resource-strapped country. More than two decades ago, Callahan in his highly controversial book, Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Ageing Society [1] argued that expensive medical aid needs to be prudently decided and rationed carefully for the elder members. Even earlier to this, Veatch [2] had made a strong opinion of favoring younger population over elderly group in resource allocation. With rise in average life expectancy, burden of chronic and intractable diseases too has increased. On the other hand, there is an ever increase in the healthcare resource cost, socio-economic rift between rich and poor and population growth. These factors make it formidable to discuss healthcare rationing. Hospitals, across the world are already under pressure of huge patient influx, majority of whom are elderly, chronically ill and dying. The emergence of COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 has crippled the healthcare system even more. In India, healthcare institutions are already facing challenges in balancing issues around ethics, economic efficiency, universal access, and delivering medical services. In the present context, where health indicators are poor, the issue of ethics becomes more complex and requires a nuanced understanding and appreciation of the social predicaments. At present inequality in access to healthcare, unequal distribution of ",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted.

According to the survey, nearly half of those who experienced unreasonable wait times gave up seeking an appointment and did not receive care. This includes patients seeking critical mental health services. \u201cThese results are an eye-opening look at the state of access to care in our health care system,\u201d said AANP President Stephen Ferrara, DNP. \u201cA lack of timely access to care, particularly primary and preventive care, can lead to chronic conditions that put patients\u2019 lives in danger and increase costs. Delayed or deferred care can put an individual\u2019s health at greater risk for complications, which may also lead to a negative impact on mental health and lost wages for those patients. A decline in productivity for employers may also occur.\u201d Among those surveyed, 26% reported waiting more than two months to gain access to a health care provider. This situation extends across all major demographics, including age, gender and education, and it impacts access to care in all geographic areas, including rural, suburban and urban settings. Those most likely to give up on seeing a provider after a lengthy wait include younger adults, people living in urban areas and respondents who reported their ethnicity as Hispanic. \u201cAs a nation, we can solve the growing crisis in access to care by modernizing the outdated policies that sideline NPs from delivering care they are educated and clinically prepared to provide,\u201d said AANP Chief Executive Officer Jon Fanning MS, CAE, CNED. \u201cWe can help shorten wait times and give patients timely access to the ca",

The effects of predicted emergency wait times on the health and volume of patients who present for care Author Affiliation Abstract Healthcare is often free at the point-of-care so that price does not deter patients. However, the dis-utility from waiting for care that often occurs could also lead to deterrence. I investigate responses in the volume and types of patients that demand emergency care when predicted waiting times quasi-randomly change. I leverage a discontinuity to compare emergency sites with similar predicted wait times but with different apparent wait times displayed to patients. I use impulse response functions estimated by local projections to estimate effects of predicted wait times on patient demand for care. An additional thirty minutes of predicted wait time results in 15% fewer waiting patients at urgent cares and 2% fewer waiting patients at emergency departments within three hours of display. Patients that stop using emergency care are also triaged as healthier. However, at very high predicted wait times, there are reductions in demand for all patients including sicker patients.

But the question of which countries have the shortest wait times is complicated by the different ways that countries measure wait time and the differences in the health care systems of various countries. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) measured wait times in several countries, specifically: Are health care wait times longer in countries with universal health care than in the United States? A common misconception in the U.S. is that countries with universal health care have much longer wait times. However, data from nations with universal coverage, coupled with historical data from coverage expansion in the United States, show that patients in other nations often have similar or shorter wait times. The U.S. was on the higher side for the share of people who sometimes, rarely, or never get an answer from their regular doctor on the same day at 28%. Canada had the highest at 33% and Switzerland had the lowest at 12%. The U.S. was towards the lower end for the share of people waiting one month or more for a specialist appointment at 27%.

The aim of this systematic study was to investigate the connection between patient safety and the RONC. MATERIAL AND METHODS A thorough search of electronic databases was done to find research that examined the relationship between restricting nurse services and patient safety. The systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two reviewers (M.L. and A.P.) independently screened the titles and abstracts, and full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. Data were extracted, and a quality assessment was performed using appropriate techniques. RESULTS A total of 15 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies included in the review demonstrated a correlation between rationing of nursing care and patient safety. The results of these studies revealed that there is an inverse relationship between rationing of nursing care and patient safety. The review found that when nursing care is rationed, there is a higher incidence of falls, medication errors, pressure ulcers, infections, and readmissions. In addition, the review identified t",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come.

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK Rationing health care: its impact and implications for hematology-oncology. T P Duffy Abstract Rationing of health care in the United States currently exists via the covert mechanism of restricting significant segments of medical care for many of those who cannot afford it. Provision of universal health care would necessitate explicit rationing of certain interventions and technologies, even though an individual could afford them. The British and Canadian experiences provide lessons from which America can profit, and the Oregon health plan is an experiment in this direction. The progressive \"graying\" of America has raised the question of the need for intergenerational charity as a form of rationing. The implications of these rationing plans would result in a major restructuring of the practice of hematology-oncology. Full text Selected References These references are in PubMed.

Its effects show on an emotional level and it affects medical practice. A distinction is made between explicit and implicit health care rationing. For example, performing fewer human organ transplants can be regarded as explicit rationing. Implicit or soft rationing may arise through either an undersupply of medical and nursing staff or through an oversupply of medical care as a consequence of the DRG bonus system. In this way an underlying and misleading incentive for an oversupply of diagnoses and treatments is created while at the same time the pressure is increased to reduce the length of hospital stay. Consequently, patients especially miss out on what they need most at this late stage of life: care and time to care. There are no clear rules for old-age-based health care rationing, which undermines the credibility of the health care system.

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Rationing of nursing care (RONC) refers to necessary nursing tasks that nurses refuse or fail to do because of limited time, staffing level, or skill mix. As an important process factor, it affects the quality of patient care. The concept of rationing of nursing care has not yet been clearly defined and analyzed and there are different views regarding this issue. Using Walker and Avant's eight-step method, this concept analysis was conducted to analyze the meaning, attributes, dimensions, antecedents, and consequences of nursing care rationing. The literature was collected by searching in electronic databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar with no date limitation. Both qualitative and quantitative studies on rationing of nursing care, which were open-access and published in English, were included in this study. Thirty-three articles were investigated in the present study. The four defining attributes of RONC included the duty of performing nursing care, dealing with problems of doing nursing care, decision-making and prioritizing, and outcome. The antecedents included nurse-related, organization-related, care-related, and patient-related antecedents. A theoretical definition and a conceptual model of RONC were developed.",

One approach is intensifying price competition. The increase in price based competition, which changes the incentives hospitals face, coupled with the fact that consumers can more easily evaluate the quality of hotel services compared with the quality of clinical care, may lead hospitals to allocate more resources into hotel rather than clinical services. Methods To test this hypothesis we studied hospitals in California in 1982 and 1989, comparing resource allocations prior to and following selective contracting, a period during which the focus of competition changed from quality to price. We estimated the relationship between clinical outcomes, measured as risk-adjusted-mortality rates, and resources. Results In 1989, higher competition was associated with lower clinical expenditures levels compared with 1982. The trend was stronger for non-profit hospitals. Lower clinical resource use was associated with worse risk adjusted mortality outcomes. Conclusions This study raises concerns that cost reductions may be associated with increased mortality.

One approach is intensifying price competition. The increase in price based competition, which changes the incentives hospitals face, coupled with the fact that consumers can more easily evaluate the quality of hotel services compared with the quality of clinical care, may lead hospitals to allocate more resources into hotel rather than clinical services. Methods: To test this hypothesis we studied hospitals in California in 1982 and 1989, comparing resource allocations prior to and following selective contracting, a period during which the focus of competition changed from quality to price. We estimated the relationship between clinical outcomes, measured as risk-adjusted-mortality rates, and resources. Results: In 1989, higher competition was associated with lower clinical expenditures levels compared with 1982. The trend was stronger for non-profit hospitals. Lower clinical resource use was associated with worse risk adjusted mortality outcomes. Conclusions: This study raises concerns that cost reductions may be associated with increased mortality.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/). Abstract The healthcare sector faces several challenges, such as rising costs, rising demand, and the need for sustainability. A new area of healthcare has emerged due to these problems, focusing on long-term improvements in management, social policy, and health economics. This research explores the cutting edge of healthcare, concentrating on long-term advancements in management, social policy, and health economics. To better understand the problems affecting the healthcare sector and to pinpoint the areas where sustainable solutions are most required, a survey of 2000 healthcare professionals and policymakers was performed. The data were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM), and a thorough sustainable healthcare model was created. According to the survey's findings, the healthcare sector now faces three significant challenges: growing prices, increased demand, and the need for sustainability. According to the respondents, the three main areas where sustainable innovations are most required are management, social policy, and health economics. These conclusions were supported by the (SEM) analysis, which also showed that sustainable practices in these fields significantly impact th",

Citation PDF Altmetric Abstract A principal component of physician decision making is judging what interventions are clinically appropriate. Due to the inexorable and steady increase of health care costs in the US, physicians are constantly being urged to exercise judicious financial stewardship with due regard for the financial implications of what they prescribe. When applied on a case-by-case basis, this otherwise reasonable approach can lead to either inadvertent or overt and arbitrary restriction of interventions for some patients rather than others on the basis of clinically irrelevant characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, or skin color. In the absence of systemwide reform in which the resources saved from one patient or group of patients are reallocated for the benefit of others, prudence is urged in the application of \u201cbedside rationing.\u201d Case Mr. J is a 58-year-old black man who has been mostly homeless for the past eight years. He has a number of chronic medical conditions of which end-stage renal failure is his most critical. He has been receiving hemodialysis for six years. Because he does not have health insurance and is not eligible for Medicaid in the state in which he resides, Medicare covers many of the costs associated with care for his kidney disease under the end-stage renal disease benefit.

Abstract Aims and objectives Systematic review of the impact of missed nursing care on outcomes in adults, on acute hospital wards and in nursing homes. Background A considerable body of evidence supports the hypothesis that lower levels of registered nurses on duty increase the likelihood of patients dying on hospital wards, and the risk of many aspects of care being either delayed or left undone (missed). However, the direct consequence of missed care remains unclear. Design Systematic review. Methods We searched Medline (via Ovid), CINAHL (EBSCOhost) and Scopus for studies examining the association of missed nursing care and at least one patient outcome. Studies r",

Rationing was measured using the newly developed Basel Extent of Rationing of Nursing Care (BERNCA) instrument. Additional data were collected using an adapted version of the International Hospital Outcomes Study questionnaire. Design: Multi-hospital cross-sectional surveys of patients and nurses. Setting: Eight Swiss acute care hospitals Participants: Nurses (1338) and patients (779) on 118 medical, surgical and gynecological units. Main outcome measures: Patient satisfaction, nurse-reported medication errors, patient falls, nosocomial infections, pressure ulcers and critical incidents involving patients over the previous year. Results: Generally, nurses reported rarely having omitted any of the 20 nursing tasks listed in the BERNCA over their last 7 working days.

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Affiliation Is rationing the inevitable consequence of medical advance? Author Affiliation Abstract The past decades have seen an impressive advance in medical technology. However, there are concerns about the growing costs of medical technology and the need to ration health care services. Some economists argue that the use of technology might be expensive now but that it would be unwise to ration technological advances as they will save money in the long-term. The author argues that increased productivity in health care does not necessarily lead to reduction of costs. In fact, it has often resulted in increased costs because such innovations made possible a widening of the indications for the treatment. Rationing of medical technology is inevitable, as further advances of technology will lead to higher pressures on the financing of the public health care system and the increased removal from the basic package of long-term care services for chronic conditions, the provision of which is an important responsibility of our society.

By Jonathan Cohn The New Republic November 12, 2007 But one argument against universal health insurance isn\u2019t so easy to dismiss: the argument about innovation and the cutting edge of medical care. It goes more or less along the lines of my conversation with Mike Kinsley: In a universal coverage system, the government would seek to limit spending by forcing down payments to doctors and pharmaceutical companies, while scrutinizing treatments for cost-effectiveness. This, in turn, would lead to both less innovation and less access to the innovation that already exists. But it\u2019s one thing to say that universal coverage could lead to less innovation or reduce the availability of high-tech care. It is quite another to say that it will do those things, which is the claim that opponents frequently make. That argument requires several leaps of logic, many of them highly suspect. The forces that produce innovation in medicine turn out to be a great deal more complicated than critics of universal coverage seem to grasp. Ultimately, whether innovation would continue to thrive under universal health care depends entirely on what kind of system we create and how well we run it. In fact, it\u2019s quite possible that universal coverage could lead to better innovation. The single biggest source of medical research funding, not just in the United States but in the entire world, is the National Institutes of Health (NIH): Last year, it spent more than $28 billion on research, accounting for about one-third of the total dollars spent on medical research and development in this country (and half the money spent at universities). The majority of that money pays for the kind of basic research that might someday unlock cures for killer diseases like Alzheimer\u2019s, aids, and cancer. No other country has an institution that matches the NIH in scale. And that is probably the primary explanation for why so many ",

The primary explicit healthcare rationing policies utilised in Spain include a catalogue that defines the healthcare rights of citizens. However, the existing system may lead to inequity between regions, and is not structured to direct resources towards the most cost-effective options. Health technology assessment requires further work before it can be utilised widely for the development of rationing strategies. Selective reimbursement of drugs and drug co-payments provide only short-term results and appear to have little long-term impact on expenditure. Implicit rationing instruments, especially waiting lists, have had a significant effect on healthcare quality and the welfare of citizens, and have contributed to keeping the Spanish healthcare budget under control. Newer regulations should integrate some form of economic evaluation within the policy-making processes associated with healthcare. Further research is needed to identify those efficient and equitable rationin",

This article explores the concept of rationing, how it works, historical examples, risks associated with it, and its significance in different economic contexts. Understanding rationing Rationing is a critical economic concept involving the controlled distribution of goods and services during times of scarcity. Typically mandated by governments, rationing aims to manage the impact of limited supply and demand imbalances. This article delves into the multifaceted world of rationing, covering its definition, how it functions, historical cases, risks, and its role in various economic systems. What is rationing? Rationing is the systematic allocation of limited resources, goods, or services to ensure their equitable distribution among a population. It is a common approach when the supply of a particular item falls short of the demand, leading to concerns about price surges and inequitable access. Rationing can be initiated at local or federal levels, responding to diverse challenges such as adverse weather conditions, trade restrictions, or, in more extreme scenarios, economic recessions and wars. How rationing works Rationing functions by assigning specific quotas or limits on the amount of a particular item an individual or household can obtain. For instance, individuals may be allotted a certain amount of food per week, or restrictions may be imposed on activities like watering lawns. This controlled distribution impacts the laws of supply and demand, aiming to stabilize prices and ensure that critical goods remain accessible to all.

Many capitalist economies have temporarily resorted to rationing in order to cope with wartime or disaster-related shortages: the U.S. and Britain issued ration books during World War II, for example, limiting the quantities of tires, gasoline, sugar, meat, butter, and other goods that could be purchased.

But at other times they are actually misleading\u2014so much so that rejecting certain arguments as slippery-slope fallacies is itself fallacious. Understanding why is important morally, politically, and psychologically. A search on the phrase \u201cslippery-slope fallacy\u201d yields a variety of definitions that are not all equivalent to each other. That alone should give one pause. But in its barest bones, a slippery-slope argument is of the following form: \u201cIf A, which some people want, is done or allowed, then B, which most people don\u2019t want, will inevitably follow. Therefore, let\u2019s not do or allow A.\u201d\u00a0 The fallacy occurs when that form is not fleshed out by sufficient reasons to believe that B will inevitably follow from A, such as in the following examples: In these examples, the conclusion does not follow deductively from the premise. Nor is any reason given to believe that a chain of events set in motion by the act described in the premise will inevitably lead to what\u2019s described in the conclusion. So the above examples are not even good inductive logic. That\u2019s why they are slippery-slope fallacies. But not all slippery-slope arguments are fallacies. In some cases, that\u2019s easy to see. You\u2019ve heard the saying: \u201cGive \u2018em an inch and they\u2019ll take a yard.\u201d That isn\u2019t true of everybody, but it\u2019s definitely true of some people\u2014and I\u2019m sure you know at least one. Another example is more academic and bears greater social significance. In a famous, hotly debated paper \u201cDefining Deviancy Down\u201d (1993), the now-late New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (who was a sociologist by training) documented how several social trends that were at first thought healthy or harmless were actually quite destructive. Each trend had begun over objections that they would tilt behavior down a slippery slope. The sta",

Photo Credit: Gian Cescon\u00a0Put It On Your Wall: CanvasOnDemand.com\u00a0 In the realm of political discourse, it is not uncommon to encounter arguments that employ the slippery slope fallacy. This logical fallacy occurs when someone suggests that a particular action or policy will inevitably lead to a series of undesirable consequences, often without sufficient evidence to support the claim. While it may seem persuasive on the surface, the slippery slope fallacy can be a deceptive and manipulative tool in political discussions. This article will explore some common examples of the slippery slope fallacy being used in political arguments. Gun Control One of the most frequently debated topics in politics is gun control. Advocates on both sides of the issue often resort to slippery slope arguments. For instance, proponents of less gun control may argue that any tightening of gun regulations will inevitably lead to the government taking all your guns. While it is essential to consider the potential consequences of policy changes, making unsubstantiated claims about a direct and inevitable link between safer gun laws and the government taking all your guns is a classic slippery slope fallacy. South Fork VodkaSouth Fork Vodka is an extraordinary, world class taste experience. Taxes and Economic Policies Taxation and economic policies are another fertile ground for slippery slope arguments. Critics of tax increases may claim that any hike in taxes, no matter how modest, will lead to a complete collapse of the economy. On the flip side, proponents of higher taxes might argue that any reduction in taxes will result in a stark decline in public services and a widening wealth gap. These arguments often lack nuance and ignore the complexities of economic systems, making them slippery slope fallacies.

For example, a slippery slope argument might claim that if we allow some national parks to close at night, then soon all national parks will be completely closed to the public. It\u2019s important to understand slippery slopes, since they play a role in many situations, both in people\u2019s internal reasoning process as well as in debates on various topics. As such, in the following article you will learn more about the various types of slippery slopes, understand when they\u2019re fallacious and when they\u2019re reasonable, and see how you can properly respond to people who use them. \u00a0 Contents Examples of slippery slopes Slippery slope arguments are prevalent in many fields. For instance, the following is an example of a slippery slope argument\u00a0in the context of bioethics: \u201cIf we allow voluntary assisted suicide for terminal patients now, then in a few years it will become a commonplace way to get rid of unwanted people in order to reduce medical costs.\u201d Slippery slope arguments are also frequently used in the legal context. For example: \u201cIf we are willing to reduce the number of jurors from 12 to 10, then why not reduce it to just 2 people, 1 person, or none at all?\u201d Slippery slope arguments are also frequently used in politics, and especially\u00a0by traditionalists, who oppose change and who want to argue against it in the media or in the legislative context. For example: \u201cIf we increase the number of immigrants that we let into the country, we will eventually end up letting in anyone who wants to immigrate, and then the whole country will be destroyed.\u201d \u00a0 Types of slippery slopes There are three main types of slippery slopes: There is significant variation in terms of how different philosophers treat the different types of slippery slop",

Restricting sugar before birth and in early childhood greatly reduces risk of chronic disease later in life A low-sugar diet during pregnancy and in the first two years of life can meaningfully reduce the risk of chronic diseases in adulthood, a new study has found, providing compelling new evidence of the lifelong health effects of exposure to sugar restrictions early in life. Published in Science, the study finds that children who were in the womb or born during times of sugar restrictions during their first 1,000 days after conception had up to 35% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and as much as 20% less risk of high blood pressure (hypertension) as adults. Exposure to limited sugar before birth was enough to lower risks, but continued sugar restriction after birth increased the benefits. World War II sugar rationing poses a natural experiment Taking advantage of an unintended \u201cnatural experiment\u201d from World War II, researchers at the USC Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, in collaboration with McGill University in Montreal, and the University of California, Berkeley, examined how sugar rationing during the war influenced long-term health outcomes. The United Kingdom introduced limits on sugar distribution in 1942 as part of its wartime food rationing program. Rationing ended in September 1953. The researchers used contemporary data from the U.K. Biobank, a database of medical histories and genetic, lifestyle and other disease risk factors, to study the effect of those early-life sugar restrictions on health outcomes of adults conceived in the U.K. just before and after the end of wartime sugar rationing. \u201cStudying the long-term effects of added sugar on health is challenging,\u201d says study lead author Tadeja Gracner, senior economist at the USC Dornsife Center for Economic and Social Research. \u201cIt is hard to find situations where people are randomly exposed to different nutritional environments early in life and follow them for 50 to 60 years.

Rationing controls the size of the ration, which is one person's allotted portion of the resources being distributed on a particular day or at a particular time. Rationing in the United States was introduced in stages during World War II, with the last of the restrictions ending in June 1947.[1] In the wake of the 1973 Oil Crisis, gas stations across the country enacted different rationing policies and standby rationing plans were introduced. World War I Although the United States did not have food rationing in World War I, it relied heavily on propaganda campaigns to persuade people to curb their food consumption. Propaganda was targeted disproportionally towards middle class white women and their organization provided some of the most substantial support to Hoover's program to limit consumption.[2] Women's groups, like the Women's committees of the State Council of Defense organized in a variety of ways to try to provide relief to the shortages. In Wisconsin, they organized to can and preserve the food that grew in the garden of unoccupied houses.[3] Some states also implemented their own programs to help conserve food which was limited due to the war. In Wisconsin, the Council of Defense asked wholesale bakers to sign a pledge guaranteeing they'd keep bread on the shelves for longer durations.[3] World War II We discovered that the American people are basically honest and talk too much. In the summer of 1941, rationing in the United Kingdom increased because of military needs, and German attacks on shipping in the Battle of the Atlantic. The British government appealed to Americans to conserve food to help the UK. The Office of Price Administration (OPA) warned Americans of potential gasoline, steel, aluminum, and electricity shortages.[5] It believed that with factories converting to military production and consuming many critical supplies, rationing",

Collection of the National Archives and Records Administration (NAID:\u202f533936). Even before the US formally entered World War II, there was a demand for materials to supply the Allies. But there was greater demand on the part of American manufacturers to supply products for civilians. A report examining American preparation for war noted that, in 1941, US factories made more articles for civilian use than ever before. In response, the US government ordered production cuts to strip off some of this \u201cfat.\u201d They targeted items like cars, lawn mowers, juke boxes, \u201cfancy galoshes,\u201d and other items. With these limits imposed, the government estimated that $20 billion in capacity could be used for military production.[1] After Pearl Harbor and the other home front attacks of December 1941, the US officially joined World War II. Through patriotism and government mandates, war production boomed across the country. With the boom came an enormous demand for raw materials including things like steel, leather, fabrics, wood, aluminum, and rubber. Many items made from these materials -- including metal toys, cutlery, radios, refrigerators, and washing machines \u2013 disappeared from the marketplace. Their materials and manufacturing capacity instead went to the war production.[2] March 31, 1942 was the last day that manufacturers could use tin, steel, copper, aluminum, nickel, chrome, or various other materials for non-military goods.[3] Some items, like coffee, sugar, rubber, and tin were in short supply because of the war itself.

But the German occupier was keen to exclude anyone who went into hiding from food supplies. Subject Distributiebonnen Fotograaf: Allard Bovenberg. Collectie: Anne Frank Stichting. Copyright: AFS rechthebbende During World War I, food shortages also developed in the neutral Netherlands. When the threat of war increased during the 1930s, the government wanted to guarantee a good food supply through rationing. Rationing was differentiated by age group, with the importance of growing children being especially prioritised. Implementation was done by the municipalities. Allocation took place via the rationing master card (DSK) issued to residents by the municipality. Those in possession of this card were given the opportunity to buy certain goods by means of ration stamps.[1] On 12 October 1939, sugar went on sale on a trial basis; peas followed on 5 November. There was no shortage at that time.[2] The number of products rationed and the size of the quota changed regularly.[3] There was a\u00a0large population of people in hiding during the occupation. Apart from Jews, these were mainly forced labourers who did not return after leave and soldiers who wanted to avoid becoming prisoners of war. In most cases, others were able to collect stamps in their locality without any problems. However, if they were deregistered from the Population Register, their rationing card was put on a 'block list', and the official had to confiscate the master\u00a0card.[4] The Van Pels family was deleted from the Population Register at the end of 1942, so their cards were put on the block list. In the case of the Frank and Fritz Pfeffer family, for unknown reasons, this did not happen until late 1944. Presumably, therefore, unlike the Van Pelses, they kept their rationing documents.

Login Alert Article contents HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIOUR UNDER RATIONING Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 18 August 2022 Abstract The pandemic-induced economic crisis has seen a massive increase in savings as households could not spend their income. The last time that consumers were seriously rationed was during the Second World War. This article models the behaviour of households during the War years and its immediate aftermath in Ireland, Sweden, the US and UK. Savings were held in liquid form and, once the War was over and rationing eased, a consumption boom transpired. However, significant excess savings were converted into physical assets in the housing market. There is evidence that this pattern is being repeated as the Covid-19 crisis eases. Keywords 1. Introduction During and after the Second World War there was a period of extended rationing in neutral countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, as well as in participants in the conflict, such as the UK and the US. Despite the differences in attitudes of these countries with respect to the War (Harrison, Reference Harrison1998),Footnote 1 consumers were affected in similar ways: real household income rose over the war years in three of these countriesFootnote 2 but consumers were severely restricted in what they could spend their money on. While this regime was in place, whether for precautionary motives, or to postpone expenditure until the goods that households sought became available, there was a major increase in household saving.

Photo Credit: Gian Cescon\u00a0Put It On Your Wall: CanvasOnDemand.com\u00a0 In the realm of political discourse, it is not uncommon to encounter arguments that employ the slippery slope fallacy. This logical fallacy occurs when someone suggests that a particular action or policy will inevitably lead to a series of undesirable consequences, often without sufficient evidence to support the claim. While it may seem persuasive on the surface, the slippery slope fallacy can be a deceptive and manipulative tool in political discussions. This article will explore some common examples of the slippery slope fallacy being used in political arguments. Gun Control One of the most frequently debated topics in politics is gun control. Advocates on both sides of the issue often resort to slippery slope arguments. For instance, proponents of less gun control may argue that any tightening of gun regulations will inevitably lead to the government taking all your guns. While it is essential to consider the potential consequences of policy changes, making unsubstantiated claims about a direct and inevitable link between safer gun laws and the government taking all your guns is a classic slippery slope fallacy. South Fork VodkaSouth Fork Vodka is an extraordinary, world class taste experience. Taxes and Economic Policies Taxation and economic policies are another fertile ground for slippery slope arguments. Critics of tax increases may claim that any hike in taxes, no matter how modest, will lead to a complete collapse of the economy. On the flip side, proponents of higher taxes might argue that any reduction in taxes will result in a stark decline in public services and a widening wealth gap. These arguments often lack nuance and ignore the complexities of economic systems, making them slippery slope fallacies.

However, behavioral ethics research has rarely considered how unethical behavior unfolds over time. In this study, we draw on theories of self-regulation to examine whether individuals engage in a slippery slope of increasingly unethical behavior. First, we extend Bandura\u2019s (1991, 1999) social-cognitive theory by demonstrating how the mechanism of moral disengagement can reduce ethicality over a series of gradually increasing indiscretions.

Eight decades later, that policy has helped solve one of modern medicine\u2019s most pressing questions about sugar consumption and health. The study, published in Science, reveals striking evidence that limiting sugar intake in early life could significantly reduce the risk of developing diabetes and high blood pressure decades later. By examining data from Britain\u2019s post-World War II sugar rationing program, researchers uncovered that children who experienced sugar restrictions during their first 1,000 days after conception had up to 35% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and 20% less risk of hypertension as adults. The timing of this research is particularly relevant given current concerns about sugar consumption. Today\u2019s pregnant women in the United States consume more than three times the recommended amount of added sugar \u2013 over 80 grams daily. Meanwhile, most infants and toddlers regularly consume sweetened foods and beverages, despite dietary guidelines recommending zero added sugars during these crucial early years. The study, led by researchers from the University of Southern California, McGill University, and UC Berkeley, took advantage of what scientists call a \u201cnatural experiment\u201d \u2013 a rare opportunity where external circumstances create two similar groups whose only major difference is the factor being studied. \u201cStudying the long-term effects of added sugar on health is challenging.

Citizens were issued with ration books of coupons which they could spend at retailers to ensure that everyone had access to a minimum of essentials but nobody could buy in excess of restricted amounts. While some staples like bread, fruit, and vegetables were never rationed, plenty of other necessities were so that meals became simpler and more monotonous. Rationed items included meat, sugar, butter, cheese, tea, and soap. The government also encouraged people to use cheap restaurants by exempting them and their customers from any rationing. Although a black market developed where people illegally bought goods that were otherwise rationed, the ration system worked largely thanks to everyone's self-regulation. British Food Ration BookImperial War Museums (CC BY-NC-SA) Short Supplies Pre-war Britain was heavily dependent on many imported goods, which came by ship from around the British Empire, North and South America, and other trading nations. Now during the war, merchant shipping came under serious threat from German U-boats as they headed to and from Britain. Another threat to supplies came from the German bombing of major British ports and the East End docks in London. With Western and Central Europe occupied by the enemy, Britain's access to goods produced there was cut off. In 1941, Britain's exports were two-thirds lower than before the war. Another blow to supplies came when Japan occupied parts of the British Empire in the East from 1942. In addition to these limits, the government's approach to total war meant that many resources had to be diverted to the war effort such as weapons manufacturing and transportation, further limiting ",

The scheme was designed to ensure fair shares for all at a time of national shortage. The Ministry of Food was responsible for overseeing rationing. Every man, woman and child was given a ration book with coupons. These were required before rationed goods could be purchased. Basic foodstuffs such as sugar, meat, fats, bacon and cheese were directly rationed by an allowance of coupons. Housewives had to register with particular retailers. A number of other items, such as tinned goods, dried fruit, cereals and biscuits, were rationed using a points system. The number of points allocated changed according to availability and consumer demand. Priority allowances of milk and eggs were given to those most in need, including children and expectant mothers. As shortages increased, long queues became commonplace. It was common for someone to reach the front of a long queue, only to find out that the item they had been waiting for had just run out. Not all foods were rationed. Fruit and vegetables were never rationed but were often in short supply, especially tomatoes, onions and fruit shipped from overseas. The government encouraged people to grow vegetables in their own gardens and allotments. Many public parks were also used for this purpose. The scheme became better known as \u2018Dig For Victory\u2019. Certain key commodities were also rationed \u2013 petrol in 1939,\u00a0clothes in June 1941\u00a0and soap in February 1942. The end of the war saw additional cuts. Bread, which was never rationed during wartime, was put on the ration in July 1946.

The UK also imported more than half of its meat and relied on imported feed to support its domestic meat production. The civilian population of the country was about 50 million.[3] It was one of the principal strategies of the Germans in the Battle of the Atlantic to attack shipping bound for Britain, restricting British industry and potentially starving the nation into submission. To deal with sometimes extreme shortages, the Ministry of Food instituted a system of rationing. To buy most rationed items, each person had to register at chosen shops and was provided with a ration book containing coupons. The shopkeeper was provided with enough food for registered customers. Purchasers had to present ration books when shopping so that the coupon or coupons could be cancelled as these pertained to rationed items. Rationed items had to be purchased and paid for as usual, although their price was strictly controlled by the government and many essential foodstuffs were subsidised; rationing restricted what items and what amount could be purchased as well as what they would cost. Items that were not rationed could be scarce. Prices of some unrationed items were also controlled; prices for many items not controlled were unaffordably high for most people. During the Second World War rationing\u2014not restricted to food\u2014was part of a strategy including controlled prices, subsidies and government-enforced standards, with the goals of managing scarcity and prioritising the armed forces and essential services, and trying to make available to everyone an adequate and affordable supply of goods of acceptable quality.

At its core, rationing refers to the controlled distribution of scarce resources, a practice that has been pivotal in both historical and modern economic contexts. Whether it\u2019s food during World War II or credit during a financial crisis, rationing is crucial in ensuring that limited resources are allocated to maintain balance and stability. In finance, rationing helps companies manage risk, stabilize markets, and safeguard the economy during challenging periods. As we explore the historical, economic, and financial aspects of rationing, it becomes clear that this strategy remains a powerful tool for addressing scarcity, both in times of crisis and in the ongoing efforts to manage finite resources. History of Rationing Rationing in Global Crises Rationing has been a critical policy during times of great upheaval, such as wars and economic depressions. One of the most notable examples of rationing occurred during the World Wars when governments needed to ensure that limited food, fuel, and other essentials were distributed fairly across the population. Rationing in these contexts was crucial for sustaining military efforts, maintaining public order, and ensuring civilian populations could continue functioning despite the strain on resources. In the early 20th century, rationing extended into economic crises, such as during the Great Depression. As financial systems struggled and resources became scarce, rationing was used to manage both public consumption and financial resources, ensuring the economy could survive and recover from such devastating conditions. Rationing During Economic Downturns Rationing has not been confined to wartime efforts. It has also been employed during significant economic downturns, particularly financial instability.

Collection of the Hennepin County Library, Minnesota (MPW00223). Rationing was overseen by the federal Office of Price Administration (OPA), assisted by information from other wartime agencies. Using their nation-wide overview of supply, demand, and the economy, the OPA dictated which items to ration, set ceiling prices, and allocated available supply. These limits both ensured a fair distribution of goods and helped to keep inflation in check. Rationing was managed at the local level by volunteer rationing boards. By the end of the war, over 100,000 citizen volunteers were managing the program organized into about 5,600 local boards.[1] Rationed non-food items included tires, cars, bicycles, gasoline, fuel oil and kerosene, solid fuels (like coal), stoves, footwear, and typewriters (information on the rationing systems for food are written separately). To buy these items, consumers had to present both the appropriate paperwork and the money to pay for the item. Tires, Bicycles, and Gasoline The rationing of these commodities was largely to preserve rubber for the war effort. (Many other rubber-based products like hoses and raincoats were not rationed, they simply disappeared from shops.) Before the war, the United States had built up a stockpile of crude rubber, but it was only enough for a single year in peacetime. And although researchers (including Japanese scientists at Manzanar) were working on alternative sources, the technology was not advanced enough to supply both the military and civilians.[2] Collection",

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

                      "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Abstract Background Governments are facing tough choices about whether to fund new, promising but highly expensive drugs within the public healthcare system. Decisions that some drugs are not sufficiently beneficial relative to their cost to merit public funding are often contentious. The importance of making decisions that stakeholders can understand and accept as legitimate is increasingly recognized and is commonly understood to be a crucial component for stakeholder support and successful implementation. Yet, little is known about clinicians\u2019 perceptions of legitimate limit-setting. This study aimed to examine oncologists\u2019 perceptions of the legitimacy of governmental decisions to deny patients access to new cancer drugs because effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the drugs has not been demonstrated.

The aim of this paper is first to assess the degree of patient satisfaction, and second, to study the relationship between patient satisfaction of healthcare system and a set of socio-economic and healthcare provision indicators. Methods This empirical analysis covers 31 countries for the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2012. The dependent variable, the satisfaction index, is defined as the patient satisfaction of their country\u2019s health system. We first construct an index of patient satisfaction and then, at a second stage, this index is related to socio-economic and healthcare provision variables. Results Our findings support that there is a strong positive association between patient satisfaction level and healthcare provision indicators, such as nurses and physicians per 100,000 habitants, with the latter being the most important contributor, and a negative association between patient satisfaction level and number of hospital beds. Among the socio-economic variables, public health expenditures greatly shape and positive relate to patient satisfaction, while private spending on health relates negatively. Finally, the elder a patient is, the more satisfied with a country\u2019s healthcare system appears to be. Conclusions We conclude that there is a strong positive association between patient satisfaction and public health expenditures, number of physicians and nurses, and the age of the patient, while there is a negative evidence for private health spending and number of hospital beds.

To better understand the distinctive nature of US health system satisfaction, we compared the determinants of satisfaction with the health system in the United States to those in seventeen other high-income countries by applying regression decomposition methods to survey data collected in the period 2011-13. We found that concerns related to \"accessing most-preferred care\" (the extent to which people feel that they can access their top preferences at a time of need) were more important to satisfaction in the United States than in other high-income countries, while the reverse was true for satisfaction with recent interactions with the health system. Differences among US socioeconomic groups in survey responses regarding access to most-preferred care suggest that wide variation in insurance coverage and generosity may play a role in these differences. While reductions in the uninsured population and the movement toward minimum health plan standards could help address some concerns about access to preferred care, our results raise the possibil",

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person.

In February 2022 we conducted a first-of-its-kind nationally representative survey of 4,208 US adults to learn the public's reported reasons for trust in federal, state, and local public health agencies. Among respondents who expressed a \"great deal\" of trust, that trust was not related primarily to agencies' ability to control the spread of COVID-19 but, rather, to beliefs that those agencies made clear, science-based recommendations and provided protective resources. Scientific expertise was a more commonly reported reason for \"a great deal\" of trust at the federal level, whereas perceptions of hard work, compassionate policy, and direct services were emphasized more at the state and local levels. Although trust in public health agencies was not especially high, few respondents indicated that they had no trust. Lower trust was related primarily to respondents' beliefs that health recommendations were politically influenced and inconsistent. The least trusting respondents also endorsed concerns about private-sector influence and excessive restrictions and h",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

The objective of this article is, drawing on normative political theory, to sketch an argument that assigns a limited but significant role to individual responsibility in the design of the health-care system. Method: In developing our argument, we proceed in five steps. First, we review the literature on criteria for priority setting. Second, we explore the most prominent contemporary tradition in normative theory, liberal egalitarian ethics, with the aim to clarify the role of responsibility for choice. In particular, we discuss where liberal egalitarian theories would draw the 'cut' between the responsibility of the state (which is extensive) and the responsibility of the individuals (which is limited but significant). In the third step, we identify a priority setting dilemma where the commonly advocated criteria would assign equal priority. Finally, we develop a simple model in order to examine the implications of introducing a well-defined notion of responsibility for choice in a priority-setting dilemma of this kind. Results: Liberal egalitarianism holds individuals responsible for ",

The Missing Links Affiliations How Public Trust in Health Care Can Shape Patient Overconsumption in Health Systems? The Missing Links Authors Affiliations Abstract Overconsumption of health care is an ever-present and complex problem in health systems. It is especially significant in countries in transition that assign relatively small budgets to health care. In these circumstances, trust in the health system and its institutions is of utmost importance. Many researchers have studied interpersonal trust. Relatively less attention, however, has been paid to public trust in health systems and its impact on overconsumption. Therefore, this paper seeks to identify and examine the link between public trust and the moral hazard experienced by the patient with regard to health care consumption. Moreover, it explores the mediating role of patient satisfaction and patient non-adherence. For these purposes, quantitative research was conducted based on a representative sample of patients in Poland. Interesting findings were made on the issues examined. Patients were shown not to overconsume health care if they trusted the system and were satisfied with their doctor-patient relationship. On the other hand, nonadherence to medical recommendations was shown to increase overuse of medical services. The present study contributes to the existing knowledge by",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract (1) Background: Public satisfaction with the health system is a very important comprehensive indicator. Given the limited healthcare resources in a society, it is always important for policymakers to have full information about the priority and the ranking order of the factors of healthcare resources for improving public satisfaction. (2) Methods: Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) is advantageous for satisfaction analysis because satisfaction is a \u201cgrey concept\u201d of \u201chaving a clear boundary but vague connotation\u201d. The data were from the CGSS and the China Health Statistics Yearbook (2013 and 2015), with a total of 15,969 samples (average satisfaction score = 68.5, age = 51.9, female = 49.4%).

Healthcare decision-makers have sought to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services through removal or restriction of practices that are unsafe or of little benefit, often referred to as \u2018disinvestment\u2019. A systematic, integrated, evidence-based program for disinvestment was being established within a large Australian health service network. Consumer engagement was acknowledged as integral to this process. This paper reports the process of developing a model to integrate consumer views and preferences into an organisation-wide approach to resource allocation. Methods A literature search was conducted and interviews and workshops were undertaken with health service consumers and staff. Findings were drafted into a model for consumer engagement in resource allocation which was workshopped and refined.

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person. Some of the same concern arises in mixed medical systems with multiple funding sources. 3.1.

Recently, a number of market-based solutions have been proposed to attack this problem. Some of them provide provable theoretical bounds to ef\ufb01ciency and/or fairness losses under market equilib-rium. However, they are limited to markets with potentially important constraints, such as enforcing equal budget for all players, or curve-\ufb01tting players\u2019 utility into a speci\ufb01c func-tion type. Moreover, they do not generally provide an intu-itive \u201cknob\u201d to control ef\ufb01ciency vs. fairness. In this paper, we introduce two new metrics, Market Utility Range (MUR) and Market Budget Range (MBR), through which we provide for the \ufb01rst time theoretical bounds on ef\ufb01ciency and fairness of market equilibria un-der arbitrary budget assignments. We leverage this result and propose ReBudget, an iterative budget re-assignment al-gorithm that can be used to control ef\ufb01ciency vs. fairness at run-time. We apply our algorithm to a multi-resource al-location problem in multicore chips. Our evaluation using detailed execution-driven simulations shows that our budget re-assignment technique is intuitive, effective, and ef\ufb01cient.

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person. Some of the same concern arises in mixed medical systems with multiple funding sources. 3.1.

However, the exact meaning of this statement is often misunderstood. Market efficiency does not simply refer to minimizing waste. Instead, it involves a more nuanced concept of allocative efficiency in which resources are allocated in a way that maximizes the benefit to consumers and producers. In this article, we delve deeper into the concept of market efficiency and its implications for resource distribution. In economics, the concept of allocative efficiency refers to the optimal distribution of resources in a market, where the resources are allocated in such a way that it maximizes the benefit to society and minimizes the cost. It is an essential concept in understanding how markets operate and how resources are distributed among different economic agents. Market Efficiency Market efficiency is the degree to which market prices reflect all available information. In an efficient market, prices adjust quickly to new information, making it difficult for investors to consistently earn abnormal returns. There are three forms of market efficiency: weak, semi-strong, and strong. Allocative Efficiency and Market Efficiency Allocative efficiency is closely related to market efficiency. When a market is efficient, it is more likely to be allocatively efficient. This is because an efficient market ensures that resources are allocated to their highest-valued use, which is the definition of allocative efficiency. Resource Distribution The distribution of resources is a critical aspect of any economy. In a market economy, resources are distributed based on supply and demand. When there is a high demand for a resource, its price increases, which incentivizes producers to supply more of it. Conversely, when there is a low demand for a resource, its price decreases, which discourages producers from supplying it. Allocative Efficiency and Resource Distributi",

A welfare-maximizing and (possibly) budget-constrained firm, whose operating costs significantly increase as total capacity use presses against capacity, chooses prices and capacity. When the equilibrium capacity is reached, second-best Ramsey prices must be adjusted, and mark-ups on marginal costs may be higher for services with higher demand elasticities, if they intensively use capacity. Moreover, for a given output vector, the firm invests more than in first best. Instead, the equilibrium capacity may be first best when there is excess capacity to reduce operating costs and thus improve welfare. Our model can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the efficiency of market mechanisms for resource allocation and pricing, or when market mechanisms are not adopted.

Every team or organization has limited resources. You can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t do everything all at once or use the same resources for multiple things at the same time.

However, because various dimensions of resource-relatedness, synergistic effects, and moderating influences are investigated at diverse levels of analysis, the findings are very fragmented. Our review and critical assessment of the research reveals a number of conceptual issues and methodological flaws that had already constrained heavily traditional diversification research. Consequently, we suggest promising directions for future research efforts that can put this important empirical application of the resource-based view of the firm on safer ground.

Abstract Regional monopoly limits market reforms from improving cross-firm resource allocative efficiency, but little empirical evidence is available from developing countries. This paper provides rich evidence that regional monopoly may hinder the expansion of more productive firms, using the Chinese iron and steel sector as a case.

It is believed that among several alternatives a method of centrally managed needs-based resource distribution is best suited for universally appraised code of \u201cequal treatment of equals\u201d. However, the main problem hides in identification and measurement of \u201cneed\u201d and in economic effectiveness of the methodology. Supposedly, from the 1980s, as an innovative approach, the market system of health care provider reimbursement had to resolve the problems associated with centralised needs-based resource allocation, maintaining the main achievements and improving the effectiveness of the systematic distribution. Nonetheless, as this paper shows, so far there is little evidence that the market-based health care provider reimbursement advances the allocative performance of various health care systems.

Yet, projects that use mar-kets for distributed resource allocation recur every few years [1, 2, 3], and a new generation of research is exploring market-based resource allocation mechanisms [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] for distributed environments such as Planet-lab, Netbed, and computational grids. This paper has three goals. The \ufb01rst goal is to ex-plore why markets can be appropriate to use for allo-cation, when simpler allocation mechanisms exist. The second goal is to demonstrate why a new look at mar-kets for allocation could be timely, and not a re-hash of previous research. The third goal is to point out some of the thorny problems inherent in market deployment and to suggest action items both for market designers and for the greater research community. We are optimistic about the power of market design, but we also believe that key challenges exist for a markets/systems integration that must be overcome for market-based computer resource allocation systems to succeed. 1 Is there a Problem? During the past decade, we have witnessed the emer-gence of systems that are owned, deployed, and used by multiple self-interested stakeholders. Consider the dif-ferences between traditional distributed systems and cur-rent distributed environments, such as Planetlab, Netbed, and computational grids.

Markets sometimes fail to allocate resources efficiently. Such failure is particularly prevalent in the environmental arena where markets tend to underprovide environmental goods such as parks and open space and overprovide environmental bads such as air pollution. A common solution to market failure is government provision or regulation. But as free market environmentalists have argued, this path includes failures of its own\u2014government failures. The literature on free market environmentalism (FME) has consistently documented the problems associated with government providing public goods. The argument, well buttressed by evidence, suggests that in many cases markets are more efficient than the government at protecting the environment. And where market failure is persistent, modifying institutions to define property rights can often solve the failure. While FME has much to offer for problems pertaining to natural resource allocation, the case for FME is weaker when dealing with environmental goods, such as providing clean air. The basic problem lies in the nature of the market failure. One type of market failure is the inability to exclude individuals from using the good. Economists call this nonexcludability. Excludability is necessary for a market to operate so that individuals can exchange money for access to the good. Free market environmentalism focuses on designing property rights",

Market failure occurs when the allocation of goods and services by a free market is not efficient, leading to a net social welfare loss. This phenomenon is significant because it highlights the limitations of markets in addressing all societal needs and underscores the necessity for intervention. Understanding why market failures happen and how they manifest is crucial for developing effective solutions. Key Causes of Market Failure Market failure can be attributed to several underlying causes that disrupt the equilibrium of supply and demand, leading to inefficiencies. One primary cause is the presence of monopolies or oligopolies, where a single firm or a small group of firms dominate the market. This concentration of market power allows these entities to manipulate prices and output, often resulting in higher prices for consumers and reduced overall welfare. The lack of competition stifles innovation and can lead to suboptimal production levels. Another significant cause is the existence of externalities, which are costs or benefits incurred by third parties who are not directly involved in a transaction. Negative externalities, such as pollution from a factory, impose additional costs on society that are not reflected in the market price of the product. Conversely, positive externalities, like the benefits of education, are not fully captured by the market, leading to underinvestment in these areas. Both types of externalities result in a misallocation of resources, as the market fails to account for the true social costs and benefits. Information asymmetry also plays a crucial role in market failure. When one party in a transaction possesses more or better information than the other, it can lead to adverse selection and moral hazard. For instance, in the insurance market, individ",

Market Failures: When the Invisible Hand Gets Shaky Highlights: The enormously complicated problem of deciding where and how all of society\u2019s resources might best be used is usually solved by individuals following their own self-interest in markets largely free of government oversight. Markets fail when exchanges between willing buyers and sellers are impeded and efficiency is compromised. Overcoming such market failures is a role for government, but devising a solution that improves upon the status quo may not always be possible. 'Every individual\u2026 neither intends to promote the public interest, nor knows how much he is promoting it\u2026he intends only his own gain, and he is in this, as in many other cases, led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention'.Adam Smith, The Wealth of Nations, 1776 By \u201cthe invisible hand,\u201d Adam Smith refers to the notion that desirable social goals are usually reached by individuals following only their own self-interest. The self-interested interactions among individuals generate prices that coordinate complex economic undertakings, directing each individual\u2019s labor and capital to where it is most valued. Thus, public sector controls on economic activity are usually not needed, and such controls often degrade society\u2019s ability to produce and distribute goods and services. Smith argued against unnecessary government intervention into or regulation of markets. But Smith also recognized that there are circumstances where markets fail to coordinate economic activity. When markets fail, there may, indeed, be justification for some market regulation by government. Smith saw an obvious role for th",

Snoeren, Amin Vahdat February 20, 2008 1 Introduction Many computer systems have reached the point where the goal of resource allocation is no longer to maximize utilization; instead, when demand exceeds supply and not all needs can be met, one needs a policy to guide resource allocation decisions. One natural policy is to seek e\ufb03cient usage, which allocates resources to the set of users who have the highest utility for the use of the resources. Researchers have frequently proposed market-based mechanisms to provide such a goal-oriented way to allocate resources among competing interests while maximizing overall utility of the users. The emergence of several large-scale, federated computing infrastructures [6, 2, 8, 4, 49], creates an opportunity to revisit the use of market mechanisms to allocate computing resources. There are several common characteristics of federated systems that make a market-based approach appropriate. First, the end-users of these systems commonly have synchronized demand patterns (e.g., due to shared conference deadlines or other external events), which makes excess resource demand a common occurrence. Second, resource ownership is shared by the community, and therefore, there are many parties with a stake in the allocation policies used by the system. Finally, there is a large number of resources, which means that resource contention cannot be resolved by human administration or simply by the result of an uncoordinated process. An allocation system designed around a market can lead to a socially optimal allocation outcome to all users, which is particularly important during times of heavy resource contention. Markets also create a natural structure for globally desirable incentives and user behavior and can relieve system administrators from a signi\ufb01cant management burden.

Governments can collect information about individuals\u2019 types and enforce transfers across individuals. Markets (without signi\u2026cant government intervention) have to rely on transactions that are ex post bene\u2026cial for individuals. Consequently, governments achieve better risk sharing and con-sumption smoothing than markets. However, politicians in charge of collective decisions can use the centralized information and the enforcement power of government for their own bene\u2026ts. This leads to political economy distortions and rents for politicians, making government-operated allocation mecha-nisms potentially worse than markets. We provide conditions under which it is ex ante bene\u2026cial for the society to tolerate the political economy distortions in exchange for the improvement in risk sharing. For example, more e\u00a4ective controls on politicians or higher discount factors of politicians make gov-ernments more attractive relative to markets. Moreover, when markets cannot engage in self-enforcing risk-sharing arrangements and income e\u00a4ects are limited, greater risk aversion and greater uncertainty make governments more attractive relative to markets. Nevertheless, we also show theoretically and numerically that the e\u00a4ect of risk aversion on the desirability of markets may be non-monotonic. In particular, when markets can support self-enforcing risk-sharing arrangements, a high degree of risk aversion improves the extent of risk sharing in markets and makes governments less necessary. The same pattern may also arise because of \u201cincome e\u00a4ects\u201d on labor supply. Consequently, the welfare gains of governments relative to markets may have an inverse U-shape as a function of the degree of risk aversion of individuals.

In a free-market economy, resources are allocated by prices. In this way, a market economy is self-regulating, allowing real-time coordination across millions of goods and services, without any central authority knowing and setting all the prices. In this article, you\u2019ll learn how prices allocate resources and how supply and demand respond to prices. The Economics of Resources Allocation The most straightforward way to allocate resources across an economy is for a central authority to decide what to do. In a feudal economy, the lord tells people what to grow and how to sell it. The Soviet Union operated similarly, with the government determining how much steel to produce in Bulgaria and how much wheat to be grown in Ukraine. The problem with this method is that economies are so complex, with many millions of products and services, that allocating resources optimally across millions of items is incredibly difficult. Counterproductive incentives also arise in these centralized systems which is why in modern economies, resources are allocated without a centralized authority. How are resources allocated in a market economy? Market economies use prices to allocate scarce resources. On a micro-level, each consumer and producer makes transactions with other individuals on whatever terms they can agree on. The terms often consist of prices. Even though a market economy has millions of goods with millions of prices, each party in the transaction just needs to keep track of the few prices relevant to their own decision-making, not the entire economy\u2019s prices.\u00a0 For example, a camera lensma",

Market failure occurs when the true cost of a good is not reflected in the price, resulting in an inefficient allocation of resources. This can happen when a third party benefits but does not pay for that benefit, or when a cost is imposed on a third party without their consent or compensation. For instance, pollution imposes a cost on society and the environment. However, these external costs are not accounted for in the final price of the good, leading to a net cost to society.Key PointsA market failure is where there is an inefficient allocation of resources. This comes either through an undersupply or over-demand, or, where there are externalities.When a company does not pass on the cost, both internal and external, onto the final consumer, there is market failure.Solutions to market failure include a number of private, government, and voluntarily collective solutions.Market failure can occur due to various reasons, including externalities and inefficient supply. For instance, the UK\u2019s national healthcare system, which is free at the point of use, experiences a high level of demand that it struggles to meet, resulting in patients facing long waiting times. This leads to an inadequate meeting of demand, making it an example of market failure.\u201cA market failure occurs when there is an inefficient allocation of resources.\u201dSupply <> Demand = Market FailureMarket failure can occur due to externalities, where a third party may benefit from a good without directly paying for it. This can lead to an inefficient allocation of resources, as the true cost of the good is not reflected in its price.For example, the construction of a local park may create positive externalities in the form of recreational activities for people, but the benefits are not directly ",

Skylar Clarine is a fact-checker and expert in personal finance with a range of experience including veterinary technology and film studies. What Is Market Failure? Market failure refers to a situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. In an ideally functioning market, the forces of supply and demand balance each other out, with a change on one side of the equation leading to a change in price that maintains the market's equilibrium. In a market failure, however, this balance is disrupted. When markets fail, the individual incentives for rational behavior do not lead to rational outcomes for the group. In other words, each individual makes the correct decision for themselves, but those prove to be the wrong decisions for the group as a whole. Key Takeaways Matthew Collins / Investopedia Understanding Market Failure A market failure refers to the inefficient distribution of resources that occurs when the individuals in a group end up worse off than if they had not acted in rational self-interest. In the case of a market failure, the overall group incurs too many costs or receives too few benefits. The economic outcomes under market failure deviate from what economists usually consider optimal and are usually not economically efficient. Contrary to what the name implies, market failure does not describe imperfections only in market economies. There can be market failures in government activity, too. One noteworthy example is rent seeking by special interest groups. Special interest groups can benefit by lobbying for small costs on everyone else, such as through a tariff. When each small group imposes its costs, the whole group is worse off than if no lobbying had taken place. Not every bad outcome from market activity counts as a market failure. In ad",

It is triggered when there is an acute mismatch between supply and demand, prices do not match reality, or when individual interests are not aligned with collective interests. A simple example of market failure is when a monopolist seller sets high rates to the products leaving no choice for the buyers other than to purchase the overpriced goods. Solutions to market failure in economics include using legislation to prevent people from making decisions that will harm the collective and teaching people about the market. Market Failure Explained Market failure economics revolves around market disruptions arising from various reasons. In economics, to understand why a market can be considered a failure, we need to understand how markets should work. According to economic theory, markets coordinate producers and consumers by determining the price. If markets are working properly, the price of something will result from the differences between supply and demand. So, a dysfunctional market would be one in which prices are unreasonable. An example will be if a product has inflation much higher than its actual value. A market failure occurs when prices do not match reality. In this distorted market, prices do not represent the supply and demand of a service or product correctly, and there's a mismatch between individual needs and supply in a free market. The most common examples and types include missing markets, monopolies, externalities, etc. Causes Imperfections in a market do not necessarily make a failure. All markets tend to suffer from several issues. The main problem is when you cannot use the market prime function: regulate the relationship between buyers and producers.

This imbalance transpires when the volume of services or goods supplied does not align with consumer demand, resulting in market disequilibrium.\u00a0Such disparities are instigated by various influences, namely externalities, public goods, monopolistic powers, information asymmetry, moral hazard, and adverse selection. The inception of market failures from externalities, such as pollution from production, exacts a toll on individuals and communities, fostering a negative impact.\u00a0Furthermore, the provision of public goods, inherently lacking in exclusivity or rivalry, faces undersupply in a market-dominated setting, compelling governmental interference or fiscal support. Entrenched market controls, illustrated through monopolies or oligopolies, signify undue market leverage that disrupts equitable pricing, thus promulgating market inefficiency.\u00a0Simultaneously, the shortfall of crucial market information leads to skewed market decisions, either overvaluing or undervaluing commodities or services, thereby undermining market balance. The aftermath of market failure manifests in resource misallocation, instigating significant economic and social ramifications.\u00a0A profound comprehension of the etiologies and rectifications of these failures is indispensable for stakeholders aiming to boost both economic productivity and societal well-being. Econometrics Tutorials What is Market Failure? Market failure describes the inadequacy of the free market to distribute resources effectively, leading to inefficiencies in the economy.\u00a0In an ideal market, the interplay between supply and demand ensures a natural equilibrium.

Does the U.S. spend too little on prevention? Should it spend more (and if so, on what)? Since much of the evidence comes from cost-effectiveness studies, a brief explanation of how cost-effectiveness analysis is used to evaluate medical interventions is provided. The evidence, from hundreds of studies published over the last four decades, shows that most preventive interventions add more to medical spending than they save, even as they improve health. With prevention, as with so much else, it costs more to get more. Moreover, the U.S. spends considerably more on prevention than commonly thought (see chapter 2 of this volume), even without considering the vast array of preventive activities outside the medical sector. Prevention is not a solution to the health care cost problem. Each intervention needs to be evaluated individually and the goal should be to find the most effective mix of health services, the one that makes the best use of our resources to improve health and extend life, whether through prevention or treatment.

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity. Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and s",

In this journey, we have come to realise the immense power and efficiency of preventative care over the traditional reactive approach. Let\u2019s delve into why proactive measures are, without a doubt, the champions of holistic healthcare. Tracing Back: The Reign of Reactive Healthcare The traditional healthcare model has often been a reactionary one: you fall ill, you seek treatment. It was a cycle most of us were familiar with. Though functional, it predominantly focused on treating symptoms rather than understanding and mitigating root causes, often leaving patients in a loop of illness and recovery. The Dawning of a New Era: Embracing Preventative Care As the saying goes, \u201cPrevention is better than cure\u201d. By the late 20th century, this adage began to hold significant weight in the medical community. With the advent of new research and technologies, healthcare started leaning towards proactive measures, aiming to prevent ailments rather than just treat them. This shift recognised the importance of early detection, lifestyle choices, and regular health check-ups in maintaining optimal health. Drawing the Line: Key Distinctions Between the Two Models While both reactive and preventative approaches aim to ensure wellbeing, their methodologies differ vastly. Reactive care is often more immediate and short-term, dealing with health concerns as they arise. On the other hand, preventative care focuses on long-term health, involving regular check-ups, lifestyle adjustments, and early interventions.

By catching potential health issues early, preventive healthcare aims to prevent diseases from developing or to detect them at stages when they are easier and less costly to treat. \u00a0 The Significance of Regular Check-Ups Regular health check-ups for certain patients with certain medical conditions can be a vital aspect of preventive healthcare. These touch-points offer a chance for healthcare providers to catch potential health issues before they become serious. Routine check-ups can identify early signs of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer, which are often more manageable when detected early. \u00a0 Health Education as a Cornerstone of Preventive Care Health education is fundamental to preventive healthcare. By empowering individuals with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their health, health education plays a pivotal role in promoting wellness and preventing disease. An informed individual can make lifestyle changes, adhere to recommended screenings and immunizations, and manage chronic conditions more effectively. \u00a0 Immunizations and Screenings in Preventive Care Immunizations play a critical role in preventing infectious diseases. Screenings, such as those for cancer, can detect diseases at an early, often more treatable, stage. Regular screenings can significan",

But the investment in primary care could also benefit insurers and taxpayers\u2014and CVS itself, of course. Providing proactive rather than reactive healthcare may generate huge financial value, suggests research by Chicago Booth PhD student Dilara Sonmez, University of Chicago Medicine\u2019s George Weyer, and Booth\u2019s Dan Adelman. Primary care providers and healthcare organizations can reap the greatest benefits by implementing a proactive care strategy that encourages patients to have regular primary care visits with the same PCP, according to the study. Patients who seek primary care services when feeling unwell or experiencing symptoms from chronic conditions, such as elevated blood sugar and complications from diabetes, are receiving reactive care, the researchers write. These patients are more likely to wind up in the hospital, requiring insurance to cover those costs. But patients with chronic conditions who visit their PCP on a regular basis likely receive medication and appropriate testing, which helps them avoid complications and hospital stays. To quantify the impact of proactive care, the researchers obtained data from Medicare, the United States\u2019 federal medical-insurance program mostly for people aged 65 and over. Medicare expenditures were $747 billion in the most recent fiscal year, about 12 percent of total federal government spending. Hospital expenses were the largest single component of that, accounting for nearly 40 percent of the program\u2019s outlay",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of the nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion annual healthcare spending goes to treating people with chronic and mental health conditions. This figure highlights the urgent need for a shift in priorities. Imagine how much healthier Americans could be\u2014and how much money could be saved\u2014if the focus moved from reactive care to preventive care. Such a shift would improve individual outcomes and create a more sustainable healthcare system. Reactive vs. Preventive Care The healthcare system operates through two primary approaches: reactive care and preventive care. Reactive care focuses on treating illnesses and conditions after they develop. Most medical providers in the U.S. follow this model, which often delays intervention until a health problem becomes serious. For example, patients with diabetes might only seek treatment after symptoms worsen, leading to hospitalizations or long-term complications. On the other hand, preventive care emphasizes measures taken to avoid diseases altogether. These include vaccinations, screenings, early detection, and healthy lifestyle interventions. By addressing potential health risks early, preventive care can reduce the need for costly treatments later. The Hidden Costs of a Reactive Approach Reactive care is not only expensive but also less effective. Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension account for a significant portion of healthcare spending. For example, the American Diabetes Association estimates the annual cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. at $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs. Much of this expense could be mitigated with preventive measures such as early lifestyle interventions and routine health monitoring. Reactive care also strains emergency services.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Summary Communicating public health guidance is key to mitigating risk during disasters and outbreaks, and ethical guidance on communication emphasizes being fully transparent. Yet, communication during the pandemic has sometimes been fraught, due in part to practical and conceptual challenges around being transparent. A particular challenge has arisen when there was both evolving scientific knowledge on COVID-19 and reticence to acknowledge that resource scarcity concerns were influencing public health recommendations. This essay uses the example of communicating public health guidance on masking in the United States to illustrate ethical challenges of developing and conveying public health guidance under twin conditions of uncertainty and resource scarcity. Such situations require balancing two key principles in public health ethics: the precautionary principle and harm reduction. Transparency remains a bedrock value to guide risk communication, but optimizing transparency requires consideration of additional ethica",

Healthcare standards may need to be altered to respond to an imbalance between demands for care and resources. Clinical decisions that involve triage and scarce resource allocation may present unique ethical challenges. To address these challenges, the authors detailed tenets and procedures to guide triage and scarce resource allocation during public health emergencies. The authors propose health care organizations deploy a Triage and Scarce Resource Allocation Team to over-see and guide ethically challenging clinical decision-making during a crisis period. The authors' goal is to help healthcare organizations and clinicians balance public health responsibilities and their duty to individual patients during emergencies in as equitable and humane a manner as possible.

However, although social, demographic, and geographic determinants of preventive care have been studied, there is little information about how the workplace affects preventive care utilization. This study examines how four types of organizational policies and practices (OPPs) are associated with individual workers' preventive care utilization. We used data collected in 2012 from 838 hospital patient care workers, grouped in 84 patient care units at two hospitals in Boston. Via survey, we assessed individuals' perceptions of four types of OPPs on their work units. We linked the survey data to a database containing detailed information on medical expenditures. Using multilevel models, we tested whether individual-level perceptions, workgroup-average perceptions, and their combination were associated with individual workers' preventive care utilization (measured by number of preventive care encounters over a two-year period). Adjusting for worker characteristics, higher individual-level perceptions of workplace flexibility were associated with greater preventive care uti",

Although previous studies suggest that increasing primary care provider numbers may be beneficial, the mechanism responsible for the association is unclear, and have not linked primary care access to specific preventative interventions. We investigated the association between the number of times patients accessed their primary care provider team and the likelihood they received selected preventative health interventions. Methods: Patients with complete data sets from Sanford Health were categorized based on the number of primary care visits they received in a specified time period and the preventative health interventions they received. Patient characteristics were used in a propensity analysis to control for variables. Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals were calculated to estimate the likelihood of obtaining preventative measures based on number of primary care visits compared with patients who had no primary care visits during the specified time period.

Abstract The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact on health care utilization and expenditure trends over time of a personalized preventive medicine program delivering individualized care focused on lifestyle behavior modification, disease prevention, and compliance with quality-related metrics. MD-Value in Prevention (MDVIP) is a network of affiliated primary care physicians who utilize a model of health care delivery based on an augmented physician-patient relationship and focused on personalized preventive health care. Multivariate modeling was used to control for demographics, socioeconomics, supply of health care services, and health status among 10,186 MDVIP members and randomly selected, matched nonmembers. Health care utilization and expenditure trends were tracked from the pre period prior to member enrollment for a period of up to 3 years post enrollment.

Chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and chronic kidney disease, are the leading causes of poor health, long-term disability, and death in the United States (2,3). One-third of all deaths in this country are attributable to heart disease or stroke, and every year, more than 1.7 million people receive a diagnosis of cancer (2). During the past several decades, the prevalence of diabetes increased dramatically; in 2015 more than 29 million Americans had diabetes and another 86 million adults had prediabetes, increasing their chance of developing type 2 diabetes (3). Diabetes increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and hypertension, and is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure (4). Chronic diseases can profoundly reduce quality of life for patients and for their families, affecting enjoyment of life, family relationships, and finances (5). Working can be difficult for people with chronic diseases: rates of absenteeism are higher and income is often lower among people who have a chronic disease compared with people who do not have one. Functional limitations can be distressing, and depression, which can reduce a patient\u2019s ability to cope with pain and worsen the clinical course of disease, is a common complication (6). Chronic diseases are also the leading drivers of health care costs in the United States (2). In 201",

Abstract Objective To describe and analyze utilization of preventive care services and their effect on cardiovascular outcomes in the United States. Methods Data from the 2007 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) were used to analyze utilization of preventive care services and their effect on cardiovascular outcomes. Recommendations by the Seventh Report of the Joint Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure and the National Cholesterol Education Program were used to determine appropriate levels of preventive care utilization. Utilization of blood pressure screening and cholesterol checkup services were used as the dependent variable, while age, gender, race, ethnicity, insurance status, and perceived health status were used as independent variables. Since guidelines differ for people with elevated blood pressure, respondents with elevated blood pressure were identified in the MEPS database by self-reported diagnosis. Descriptive statistics were used to describe the population, while a multivariate logistic regression model was ",

Written by on Medically reviewed by and Contents Contents Healthcare is expensive for everyone... employers and employees alike. About 50% of American adults report general difficulty affording healthcare costs,1 and 48% of insured adults are concerned about paying their premiums.2 Even the 153 million Americans with job-based insurance are struggling.3 According to eHealth survey data, a similar percentage of business owners faced this same struggle when covering their portion of employee benefits plans in 2022.4 As the cost of job-based health coverage in the U.S. is expected to continue rising,5 companies must consider cost-minimization strategies. Preventive care is one such strategy, as it has the potential to help prevent significant health costs down the line.6 It can also maintain better employee health overall, thereby boosting productivity gains and reducing absenteeism-related losses. Current healthcare cost landscape According to KFF, annual employer-sponsored family health coverage premiums in 2023 reached almost $24,000.7 A Global Medical Trends Survey from WTW projects a nearly 9% general increase in the cost of benefits in 2024.8 This increase is due to a few contributing factors, including a catch-up with inflation, a return to routine medical visits post-pandemic, an uptick in specialty prescriptions for things like weight loss and, finally, a rise in chronic and expensive conditions.9 Chronic conditions largely account for America's $4.1 trillion in annual healthcare spending \u00e2\u0080\u0094 90% to be exact,10 with cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer being the three leading drivers.\u00c2\u00a0 In addition to healthcare costs, U.S. employers lose about $36.4 billion annually due to chronic condition-related absenteeism.11 Not to mention productivity losses due to presenteeism \u00e2\u0080\u0094 when employees are at work but not operating at their total capacity as ",

Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

In an era where chronic diseases impose a significant economic burden, focusing on disease prevention can lead to substantial long-term savings and enhanced quality of life.\u00a0 This article delves into the importance of preventative health services from a public health perspective, emphasizing strategies such as vaccinations, screenings, and lifestyle interventions. We will also explore the economic burden of chronic diseases, the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventative services, successful public health programs and policies, and the roles of education, community engagement, technology, and data analytics in promoting preventative health behaviors and lowering health costs. The Economic Burden of Chronic Diseases Chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, are the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), chronic diseases account for approximately 75% of healthcare spending in the United States. These conditions often require long-term management, leading to high medical costs and lost productivity. The Mayo Clinic estimates that the global economic burden of chronic diseases will reach $47 trillion by 2030 if current trends continue. Prescription drug costs have also risen faster than the rate of inflation in recent years and healthcare costs overall have continued to rise. The Cost-Effectiveness of Preventative Health Measures Preventative health measures can significantly reduce the incidence and severity of chronic diseases, leading to lower healthcare costs.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of the nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion annual healthcare spending goes to treating people with chronic and mental health conditions. This figure highlights the urgent need for a shift in priorities. Imagine how much healthier Americans could be\u2014and how much money could be saved\u2014if the focus moved from reactive care to preventive care. Such a shift would improve individual outcomes and create a more sustainable healthcare system. Reactive vs. Preventive Care The healthcare system operates through two primary approaches: reactive care and preventive care. Reactive care focuses on treating illnesses and conditions after they develop. Most medical providers in the U.S. follow this model, which often delays intervention until a health problem becomes serious. For example, patients with diabetes might only seek treatment after symptoms worsen, leading to hospitalizations or long-term complications. On the other hand, preventive care emphasizes measures taken to avoid diseases altogether. These include vaccinations, screenings, early detection, and healthy lifestyle interventions. By addressing potential health risks early, preventive care can reduce the need for costly treatments later. The Hidden Costs of a Reactive Approach Reactive care is not only expensive but also less effective. Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension account for a significant portion of healthcare spending. For example, the American Diabetes Association estimates the annual cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. at $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs. Much of this expense could be mitigated with preventive measures such as early lifestyle interventions and routine health monitoring. Reactive care also strains emergency services.

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity. Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and s",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of the nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion annual healthcare spending goes to treating people with chronic and mental health conditions. This figure highlights the urgent need for a shift in priorities. Imagine how much healthier Americans could be\u2014and how much money could be saved\u2014if the focus moved from reactive care to preventive care. Such a shift would improve individual outcomes and create a more sustainable healthcare system. Reactive vs. Preventive Care The healthcare system operates through two primary approaches: reactive care and preventive care. Reactive care focuses on treating illnesses and conditions after they develop. Most medical providers in the U.S. follow this model, which often delays intervention until a health problem becomes serious. For example, patients with diabetes might only seek treatment after symptoms worsen, leading to hospitalizations or long-term complications. On the other hand, preventive care emphasizes measures taken to avoid diseases altogether. These include vaccinations, screenings, early detection, and healthy lifestyle interventions. By addressing potential health risks early, preventive care can reduce the need for costly treatments later. The Hidden Costs of a Reactive Approach Reactive care is not only expensive but also less effective. Chronic diseases like diabetes, heart di",

But does it also make economic sense? What do we know about what we spend on public health, the health outcomes arising from those invest\u00ad ments, and the resulting financial impacts? This review focuses on these questions as they relate not just to individual public health programs, but to the public health system writ large. Available evidence has demonstrated that spending on the public health system can sometimes result in important population health gains. Research suggests that these health gains can translate into resulting financial impacts beyond what was originally invested. Emerging research also suggests that population health improve\u00ad ments may be obtainable through investment in related social services sectors, although, as with the public health system, the magnitude of the return on investment remains unclear. Our nation\u2019s state and local public health systems have traditionally been funded by federal, state, and local governments and separately from the health care sector. Yet the health care sector is becoming increasingly responsible for keeping populations healthy, giving rise to synergistic opportunities between the traditionally siloed sectors. The existing evidence suggests that public health system expendi\u00ad tures can have a positive return on investment (ROI). Particularly as stakeholders look to drive innovation toward better quality and less cost, there is a need to disentangle investments into population health and understand which yield a positive return on investment.

The return of investment for preventive healthcare programmes A calculation framework for GSK's Partnership for Prevention (P4P) Martin Stepanek, Marco Hafner, Jirka Taylor, Sarah Grand-Clement, Christian Van Stolk ResearchPublished May 22, 2017 Workplace preventive health initiatives are growing in number and scope around the world, as employers increasingly realise the link between employee health and wellbeing and company's performance. The simple logic is that effective investment in health and wellbeing can save a company more than it spends on the interventions through reduced productivity losses due to lower absenteeism and presenteeism, and lower healthcare spending overall. Multiple health promotion programmes are taking place in a number of pharmaceutical companies. In general, the goal of these programme are to improve the health and wellbeing of employees by: providing healthcare support; providing healthy lifestyle alternatives; developing a workplace culture that promotes and provides support for healthy living; and, considering the mental health needs of employees. GSK's Partnership for Prevention (P4P) aims to provide all GSK employees and their benefits-eligible dependants access to preventive healthcare services. Some GSK employees work in countries where publicly funded preventive healthcare may be unavailable or limited and this is where P4P bridges a gap. Some of the interventions, particularly those aimed at smoking cessation or lowering blood pressure and cholesterol, go beyond a simple substitution of necessary preve",

This paper contributes to this endeavour by synthesizing data from cost-effectiveness evidence produced to support the development of public health guidance at the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). No comprehensive list of cost-effectiveness estimates for public health interventions has previously been published in England. Cost-effectiveness estimates using English cost data were collected and analysed from 21 (of 26) economic analyses underpinning public health guidance published by NICE between 2006 and 2010. Two hundred base-case cost-effectiveness estimates were analysed, 15% were cost saving (i.e. the intervention was more effective and cheaper than comparator). Eighty-five per cent were cost-effective at a threshold of \u00a320 000 per quality-adjusted life year and 89% at the higher threshold of \u00a330 000. A further 5.5% were above \u00a330 000 and 5.5% of the interventions were dominated (i.e. the intervention was more costly and less effective than comparator). The majority of public health interventions assessed are highly cost-effective. The next challenge is to provide commissioners with a framework that allows information from economic analyses to be combined with other criteria that supports making better investment decisions at a local level.

This study combines these analyses, adds six further guidelines published since then, and thus provides a summary of cost-effectiveness of NICE's PH interventions to the present. Methods: As in previous studies, economic evaluations carried out between 2005 and 2018 were categorised by the type of economic analysis used to extract and summarise base-case ICERs. A number of 'sensitivity analyses' were carried out to test the validity of the approach. Results: Of 71 guidelines examined, 27 used cost utility analysis (CUA) for specific interventions, yielding 380 individual base-case ICER estimates (or 221 taking into account clustering of interventions).

Although the resulting conflicts initially appeared to be quite similar in most countries, a closer look reveals a country-specific intensification and differentiation of issues. Our study focused on understanding and highlighting bioethical conflicts that were triggered, exposed or intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) and high-income countries (HICs). Methods We conducted qualitative interviews with 39 ethics experts from 34 countries (Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, Denmark, Ecuador, Ethiopia, France, Germany, India, Italy, Israel, Japan, Kyrgyzstan, Mexico, Nigeria, Oman, Pakistan, Paraguay, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, South Africa, Tunisia, T\u00fcrkiye, United-Kingdom, United States of America, Zambia) from November 2020 to March 2021. We analysed the interviews using qualitative content analysis. Results The scale of the bioethical challenges between countries differed, as did coping strategies for meeting these challenges. Data analysis focused on: Resource scarcity in clinical contexts: Scarcity of medical resources led to the need to prioritize the care of some COVID-19 patients in clinical settings globally. Because this entails the postponement of treatment for other patients, the possibility of serious present or future harm to deprioritized patients was identified as a relevant issue.

Managing Resource Scarcity in the Healthcare Industry By Gordian Healthcare facilities are in the midst of a slow-burning resource scarcity crisis, as the injunction to \u201cdo more with less\u201d has practically become an organizing principle for hospitals and care systems. For many, fighting resource scarcity has meant producing more while wasting less \u2013 assuring the lights and the air conditioning stay on but having little margin for comfort. For others, it has meant doing more work with fewer tools and less capital. Additionally, periodic Reductions in Force (RIFs) have placed extreme pressure on facilities teams to deliver a consistent level of service with fewer hands to carry the load and fewer experienced minds to problem-solve. Healthcare\u2019s resource scarcity crisis has almost always resulted in deferred facilities stewardship and ballooning backlogs of capital renewal and maintenance needs. Without a process change, the industry will find itself on a pathway to long-term failure. Factor in changing codes and regulations and the demands only grow more stringent. Evolving treatment modalities create new design requirements with more complex operations and systems, and the pandemic has added complex patient volumes. This nexus of circumstances adds up to a perfect storm that supports models for resources increases, not decreases. However; health facilities can chart a course through the mist and augment their dwindling resources by leveraging business and industry relationships. The healthcare industry and its vendors need each other, and as the economy constricts, they will need each other even more. Healthcare\u2019s Tenuous Relationships with Vendors \u2013 And Why It Needs to Change The mere suggestion of relying on businesses to help solve resource scarcity problems will make some in the healthcare industry squeamish.

Hospitals throughout the world made life-altering resource allocation decisions and prioritised the care of COVID-19 patients. Without effective models to evaluate resource allocation strategies encompassing COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 care, hospitals face the risk of making sub-optimal local resource allocation decisions. A discrete-event-simulation model is proposed in this paper to describe COVID-19, elective surgery, and emergency surgery patient flows. COV",

Chronic diseases are a tremendous burden to both patients and the health care system. In 2014, 60% of adult Americans had at least one chronic disease or condition, and 42% had multiple diseases (1). Chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and chronic kidney disease, are the leading causes of poor health, long-term disability, and death in the United States (2,3). One-third of all deaths in this country are attributable to heart disease or stroke, and every year, more than 1.7 million people receive a diagnosis of cancer (2). During the past several decades, the prevalence of diabetes increased dramatically; in 2015 more than 29 million Americans had diabetes and another 86 million adults had prediabetes, increasing their chance of developing type 2 diabetes (3). Diabetes increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and hypertension, and is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure (4). Chronic diseases can profoundly reduce quality of life for patients and for their families, affecting enjoyment of life, family relationships, and finances (5). Working can be difficult for people with chronic diseases: rates of absenteeism are higher and income is often lower among people who have a chronic disease compared with people who do not have one. Functional limitations can be distressing, and depression, which can reduce a patient\u2019s ability to cope with pain and worsen the clinical course of disease, is a common complication (6). Chronic diseases are also the leading drivers of health care costs in the United States (2). In 201",

Background: Rationed and missed nursing care has been widely studied, including its predictors and associations with patient and nurse outcomes. Design: Scoping review. Data sources: We searched for eligible studies, published between 1980-2019, in six electronic databases. Review methods: Researchers independently screened the abstracts of the retrieved studies using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The decision of whether or not to include any given study was consensus-based. Results: The search yielded 1,815 records, of which 13 were included. Three studies reported structural interventions, namely increased nurse staffing and improved nursing teamwork, both resulted in significant reductions in the rates of rationed or missed nursing care. The remaining 10 studies reported on process interventions: four concerned reminders (via technology or designated persons) and seven described interventions to change or optimize the relevant care processes.

Methods This study uses data from the\u00a02020 China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS 2020) and the ordinary least squares (OLS) method to estimate the impact of digital technology on health inequality. This work then discusses the potential transmission mechanisms through which digital technology influences health inequality. Finally, it analyses the heterogeneity effects of digital technology on health inequality across different groups. Results We find that digital technology has reduced both physical and mental health inequality. Strengthening family support, enhancing health investment, and improving health behaviours are the transmission paths from digital technology to health inequality. Groups with older cohorts, females, less-educated individuals, low-income individuals, and rural individuals benefit more from physical health inequality, whereas the impact of digital technology on mental health inequality does not differ across groups. Conclusion Digital technology has a\u00a0significant impact on reducing both physical and mental health inequality, with particularly notable benefits for vulnerable populations. It is imperative to focus more on the targeted effects of digital technology on these marginalized groups. Peer Review reports Introduction Reducing health inequality has long been a primary goal of public health [1]. The rapid advancement of digital technology provides innovative solutions to address health inequality and has garnered significant scholarly interest [2,3,4,5,6].

This has led to the rationing of care, i.e., to decision-making processes on the allocation of scarce resources, especially human resources, and on which care activities take priority over others; in turn, these processes have led to unfinished or missed care, which has serious implications for quality of care and patient safety. Concerns related to nursing shortages and lean staffing practices have increased the awareness of the problem, as patient outcomes are affected by the quality and quantity of care that they receive and led to intensified scientific inquiry into this phenomenon. This book is written by the members of the Rancare Cost Action group, whose aim is to facilitate discussion about rationing of nursing care based on a cross-national comparative approach with implications for practice and professional development.\u00a0Four working groups investigated four areas for four years: a) the conceptualization of care rationing and methodological inquiries concerning the investigation of the phenomenon, b) exploration of possible solu",

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

Abstract The costs of health care continue to increase rapidly and steeply in the United States. One area of great expense is that of intensive care units (ICUs). The causes of inflation have not been addressed effectively. ICU resources could become stretched such that they may no longer be available. This paper discusses some of the ethics and concerns behind decision making when providing ICU services in the United States. In particular, the use of electronic records with decision making tools, risk-analysis methods, and documentation of patient wishes for extraordinary care may help with better utilization of resources in the future. 1. The Financial Problem in Health Care in the United States Since the advent of Medicare in this country, health care costs have been increasing. In 1970, the United States and Canada spent similar amounts on health care, at around $100 per capita [1]. As of 2000, this figure has increased to more than $4,500 per capita in the United States, with spending on health services about 13% of the gross national product [1], much higher than in the rest of the world. It is estimated that more than 1% of the gross dom",

                      "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Image by exdez/Getty Images Our work in this area focuses on: Explore Related Telehealth The use of telehealth, already growing before COVID-19, exploded as the pandemic first began to spread, when social distancing and lockdown policies limited in-person encounters. Compared with March 2019, telehealth usage in March 2020 rose 4000% percent. The biggest jump was among mental health visits. In-person primary care visits fell during the first months of the pandemic and preventive and elective care both dropped dramatically. However, the increase in telemedicine use was not enough to offset the decline in the number of in-person primary care visits. Varieties of Telehealth Telehealth (sometimes also called telemedicine) can refer to several different types of remote patient-to-provider interactions. How have providers adapted to this change? RAND work has begun examining clinicians\u2019 experiences in practicing virtual medicine during the pandemic. A sample of psychiatrists reported switching to telehealth for the majority of their encounters during the initial spread of COVID-19 in March 2019. The psychiatrists reported overall positive perceptions of the transition, though some raised concerns about decreased clinical data for assessment, diminished patient privacy, and distractions in the home setting that reduced the quality of interactions. In the context of COVID-19, opioid treatment providers transitioning to telehealth during the pandemic quickly switched to providing telemedicine visits in high volume\u2014most of these clinicians were using some telehealth, and half were using only telehealth. Most reported changing their care patterns to help patients stay home and minimize exposure to COVID-19. Some clinicians identified positive impacts of telemedicine on patient interactions, including increased patient access, while others observed negative impacts: less structure, less clinical data, technological difficulties,",

Abstract The need to support innovation in health care delivery was prompted by payment reforms and access to digital tools and has been accelerated by the shift to virtual care as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Prior to the pandemic, a growing number of health systems set up innovation centers to focus on creating new services and exploring new business models relevant to value-based care. This is distinct from process improvement or implementation science, and often needs a different set of incentives to succeed within a large organization. We used a national survey to identify a diverse sample of innovation centers, and interviewed leaders to describe their aims, organizational structures, and activities. They all aim to improve patient outcomes a",

While there are now many AI applications that have been deployed in high-income country contexts, use in resource-poor settings remains relatively nascent. With a few notable exceptions, there are limited examples of AI being used in such settings. However, there are signs that this is changing. Several high-profile meetings have been convened in recent years to discuss the development and deployment of AI applications to reduce poverty and deliver a broad range of critical public services. We provide a general overview of AI and how it can be used to improve health outcomes in resource-poor settings. We also describe some of the current ethical debates around patient safety and privacy. Despite current challenges, AI holds tremendous promise for transforming the",

Regions Sponsored How AI can take optimised healthcare resource utilisation to the next level Photo by\u00a0Westend61/Getty Images Improving operational efficiency has emerged as a priority for healthcare facilities as they seek predictive ways to manage and allocate resources at a time of ever-increasing demand for their services. Many of them are now turning to AI as a key enabler of a more progressive approach, helping them to plan their logistical responses based on the latest data \u2013 and maintain their focus on delivering end-to-end patient care of the highest quality. Challenges for healthcare providers A growing patient load creates significant operational challenges, not least for the management of the patient experience itself. For example, where appointment schedules are not properly optimised, the disruption to patient flow throughout a facility can have a significant impact on waiting times. Providers need to be able to sustain a consistent flow of patients and visitors, and meet it with appropriate resources, including clinical staff, hospital beds and operating theatres, at every stage of the patient journey. If these challenges are not dealt with adequately, the operational consequences can mount up: dissatisfied patients, and inefficient and expensive resource utilisation. Inconsistent patient flows create long queues at more congested points. Other service locations stand idle while still consuming power and human resources as they wait for patients to come through. Leveraging AI to address these challenges In response to this typical situation, data scientists from NCS'\u00a0AI team have built a schedule optimisation tool \u2013 the Enterprise Schedule Optimisation Platform \u2013 that demonstrates how AI can plan more effectively than humans as the demand for healthcare services grows. Healthcare administrators can only engage with a limited number of data points simultaneously. But AI can compute exponential permutations from a practically limitless source",

Much of the AI technology out there is still in its infancy, but healthcare leaders have already made note of its advantages. One of the biggest being increased efficiency, which has proven to be a large bottleneck to innovation within healthcare. A lot of what's been written about AI in healthcare has been theory or prediction, but what does its adoption actually look like in practice? We\u2019ll be highlighting some real-world examples and scenarios where healthcare organizations are taking the leap into AI and the companies offering those solutions. Clinician workflow and administrative tasks According to Mckinsey & Company, nearly a quarter of U.S. national health expenditure goes toward administrative costs, which could be reduced through technology. Additionally, the U.S Department of Health and Human Services predicts that there will be a nationwide shortage of 90,000 physicians by 2025.

Key Findings from RAND Health Care Research on Telehealth Policy Lori Uscher-Pines, Shira H. Fischer Research SummaryPublished Dec 5, 2024 Photo by Geber86/Getty Images Although virtual health care has been on the horizon for years, telehealth use exploded during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic: It increased by more than 4,000 percent in the first months of the pandemic, relative to the same period in 2019 (FAIR Health, 2020). Yet increased use of telehealth offset only about half of the decline in in-person visits, suggesting that a significant amount of health care was deferred (Cantor, Sood, et al., 2022). Since the end of the public health emergency (PHE), use of telehealth has plateaued (McBain et al., 2024), but use of telehealth for mental health care remains higher than it was before the COVID-19 pandemic (Cantor et al., 2023). RAND Health Care researchers have studied telehealth's effects on care quality, access, and equity to gain insights on the uses of and preferences regarding telehealth before, during, and after the pandemic. Prepandemic policies regarding telehealth service reimbursement, which had been in place to limit overspending and potential fraud, were temporarily waived to ease access to care during the PHE (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2021; Public Law 116-136, 2020). The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 (Public Law 117-328) preserved the effects of those waivers until December 31, 2024, but policymakers and payers will soon need to make long-term decisions regarding telehealth. The key findings from recent RAND research on telehealth synthesized in this brief will help policymakers and payers make informed decisions about telehealth policies as the impact of the pandemic comes into clearer focus.

This is an Open Access article: verbatim copying and redistribution of this article are permitted in all media for any purpose Abstract Accelerated use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled uninterrupted healthcare delivery while unmasking care disparities for several vulnerable communities. The social determinants of health (SDOH) serve as a critical model for understanding how the circumstances in which people are born, work, and live impact health outcomes. We performed semi-structured interviews to understand patients and providers\u2019 experiences with telemedicine encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a deductive approach, we applied the SDOH to determine telemedicine\u2019s role and impact within this framework. Overall, patient and provider interviews supported the use of existing SDOH domains to describe disparities in Internet access and telemedicine use, rather than reframing technology as a sixth SDOH. In order to mitigate the digital divide, we identify and propose solutions that address SDOH-related barriers that shape the use of health information technologies.

In response to urgent need, regulatory agencies and private insurance companies have loosened requirements that previously inhibited the use of telehealth. The expansion of telehealth and removal of traditional barriers to care may lead to more equitable health outcomes. Impact of telehealth on health disparities Telehealth has the potential to significantly increase health care access and reduce health disparities. For example, transportation barriers are more likely found among Black, Indigenous, and Latinx individuals. For appointments that can be conducted online, telemedicine eliminates these barriers. Virtual appointments can similarly reduce burdens on low-income patients, like lost wages and the cost of childcare. Proximity to specialists and culturally-competent providers presents another barrier to quality health care. A 2015 survey of transgender people in the U.S. found that nearly 30% of respondents needed to travel over 25 miles to receive transition-related care, with 15% of respondents traveling over 50 miles. Telehealth can be used to expand access to care for people with trans experience. However, telehealth requires that patients have access to technology and the internet, as well as technological literacy. This creates a digital divide, which disproportionately disadvantages Bla",

What will this new era of virtual care look like beyond the pandemic? Here are ten telehealth examples that give a glimpse into the future of healthcare delivery \u2013 showing how telehealth can not only deliver a more convenient experience to staff and patients, but also extend the reach of care to those who may have trouble accessing it. 1. Screening and engaging patients remotely before they enter a care facility Among the many examples of telehealth that were propelled by necessity during the pandemic, one that is likely to endure is online patient screening and engagement \u2013 even before the patient sets foot in a care facility. Since COVID-19 hit, hospitals and home care organizations have been using online questionnaires to triage and monitor suspected coronavirus patients, with call centers contacting high-risk patients for additional information before referring them to the appropriate care provider. This has helped to prevent both staff and patients from being exposed to unnecessary risks, while using limited resources where they were needed the most. Although safety risks will subside as the pandemic abates, there are many other reasons why online screening and engagement tools will continue to see more widespread adoption \u2013 including increased convenience, a more engaged patient, and the potential to reduce hospital length of stay. For example, online lifestyle coaching could help get patients into better physical shape prior to a surgical procedure that would normally require them to stay in the hospital for a few days. With remote health monitoring added as a safety net after hospital discharge (see example #7 below), patients may be able to return home earlier to recover in the comfort of their homes. 2.

This vision focuses on five perspectives: individual and public engagement, involvement of health professionals, implementation within healthcare systems, health-related data, and the development of sustainable economic models that allow improved therapy, diagnostic and preventive approaches as new healthcare concepts for the benefit of the public. We further identify four pillars representing transversal issues that are crucial for the successful implementation of PM in all perspectives.

Editor\u2019s Note: This is the first in a two-part series exploring the promise and limitations of the field of personalized medicine. The second part will focus on issues around equity and access to care. Deep in the maze of laboratories on the 205-year-old campus of the University of Virginia (UVA) in Charlottesville, Audrey Putelo, a fourth-year biomedical sciences PhD candidate, spends her days studying how giving antibiotics to mice with breast cancer \u2014 thus disrupting their gut bacteria \u2014 may influence breast tumor metastasis. She hopes her research will someday inform how breast tumor metastasis is understood and treated in humans. Putelo is part of a team of graduate students studying under Melanie Rutkowski, PhD, associate professor of Microbiology, Immunology, and Cancer Biology at UVA, who are conducting experiments to understand how differences in the diversity and health of the bacteria in the gut \u2014 known as the microbiome \u2014 impact breast and ovarian cancer outcomes. \u201cThinking about how the microbiome reflects our environment is a more holistic way to think about health and disease,\u201d Putelo says. \u201cImmune responses to cancer are complex, and adding the microbiome into the equation enables us to understand how different settings dictate tumor metastasis.\u201d Rutkowski\u2019s hope is that, someday, these basic science experiments will reveal a link between gut health and cancer that can be translated into preventive health strategies and therapeutics to reduce cancer metastasis. Because gut health is specific to an individual and is influenced by a wide range of factors, any related therapeutics would be personalized to the individual patient.

This vision focuses on five perspectives: individual and public engagement, involvement of health professionals, implementation within healthcare systems, health-related data, and the development of sustainable economic models that allow improved therapy, diagnostic and preventive approaches as new healthcare concepts for the benefit of the public. We further identify four pillars representing transversal issues that are crucial for the successful implementation of PM in all perspectives. The implementation of PM will result in more efficient and equitable healthcare, access to modern healthcare methods, and improved control by individuals of their own health data, as well as economic development in the health sector. Personalised medicine (PM) represents an exciting opportunity to improve the future of individualised healthcare for all citizens (citizen herein equivalent to individuals in the society, reflecting the inclusive and fair nature of PM approaches), holding much promise for disease treatment and prevention. There are high expectations for the future, but will PM and its accompanying tools and approaches change healthcare and be widely implemented for the benefit of society and its citizens by 2030? Will scientists, innovators, healthcare providers, and others be able to provide the most suitable medicine, at the right dose, for the right person, at the right time, at a reasonable cost? Will the healthcare sector be able to find the incentives and create appropriate financial models to implement PM in daily clinical practice? These are questions that require immediat",

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people. While the health of the young can be ensured by relatively cheap preventive measures such as ex",

These books ignited a firestorm of criticism, best captured in the claim that any form of age-based healthcare rationing was fundamentally ageist, discriminatory in a morally objectionable sense. That is, the elderly had equal moral worth and an equal right to life as the nonelderly. If an elderly and nonelderly person each had essentially the same medical problem requiring the same medical treatment, then they had an equal right to receive that treatment no matter what the cost of that treatment. Alternatively, if cost was an issue because the benefits of the treatment were too marginal, then both the elderly and nonelderly patients requiring that treatment ought to be denied it. If there were something absolutely scarce about the treatment, then some fair process would have to be used to make an allocation decision (and that fair process could not use some age cutoff among the allocation criteria).

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Citation PDF Altmetric Abstract A principal component of physician decision making is judging what interventions are clinically appropriate. Due to the inexorable and steady increase of health care costs in the US, physicians are constantly being urged to exercise judicious financial stewardship with due regard for the financial implications of what they prescribe. When applied on a case-by-case basis, this otherwise reasonable approach can lead to either inadvertent or overt and arbitrary restriction of interventions for some patients rather than others on the basis of clinically irrelevant characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, or skin color. In the absence of systemwide reform in which the resources saved from one patient or group of patients are reallocated for the benefit of others, prudence is urged in the application of \u201cbedside rationing.\u201d Case Mr. J is a 58-year-old black man who has been mostly homeless for the past eight years. He has a number of chronic medical conditions of which end-stage renal failure is his most critical. He has been receiving hemodialysis for six years. Because he does not have health insurance and is not eligible for Medicaid in the state in which he resides, Medicare covers many of the costs associated with care for his kidney disease under the end-stage renal disease benefit. Mr. J is not a known substance abuser but does have significant mental health issues and has preferred to live on the streets rather than in the shelters and the halfway houses to which he has been assigned",

Based on the rationing causes and challenges to the patients and their loved ones, it is the role of the healthcare organizations and government to consider the main subjects that lead to rationing. Different spectrum strategies are designed to ensure that all patients are treated equally. Although there are other instances in which rationing must be the only option, numerous factors lead to rationing that can be resolved through alternative provisions to rationed services. Rationing in healthcare impacts patients and their loved families when they fail to access services in healthcare organizations, which emphasizes the necessity of involving various approaches to solve the problem. Healthcare rationing became the most serious and debated concern in many countries, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, in Italy, the pressure on the healthcare system was dramatically high, which raised the question of \u201cif and how\u201d to determine rationing criteria (Lund & Ayers, 2020, p. S210). On the contrary, the U. S. government attempted to balance the situation with rationing guidelines, though they only raised ethical challenges (Lund & Ayers, 2020). For instance, there was a problem of postponement of surgeries \u201cto free up space for coronavirus patients\u201d (Fink, 2020). Nevertheless, the main aspect of the issue is that demand for healthcare services will always exceed the availability of resources, which forces both medical staff and decision-makers to set priorities (Hauge et al., 2022). Given this, it can turn out to be difficult to distribute limited resources to the highest number of people. However, one cannot underestimate the role of institutions, especially those protecting the rights of vulnerable communities. For example, the Office for Civi",

To the Editor: The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has forced healthcare systems to develop strategies to allocate critical care resources when demand outstrips supply (1). The pandemic has also disproportionately impacted Black patients (2, 3), for whom baseline health disparities are well documented and largely driven by inequity in social determinants of health. Concerns about the potential for inequity in resource allocation were raised early in the pandemic, especially if morbidity limiting near-term survival was factored into allocation decisions. Two mitigation strategies to avoid inequity in allocation have been proposed: eliminating consideration of expected survival beyond 1 year and incorporating measures of social disadvantage such as the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) (2, 4, 5). Few studies have empirically evaluated the potential impact of allocation frameworks on disparities, and none have assessed the impact of these proposed modifications. We analyzed the distribution of allocation scores by patient race and modeled the impact of proposed",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract A health crisis caused by a pandemic tested the effectiveness of national healthcare systems by testing both financing and organizational and technical performance of patient care. At that time, the structural flaws in healthcare systems and inequalities in the level of healthcare in its different dimensions and countries due to resource constraints were highlighted. Therefore, the paper concentrates on investigating how the crisis in the health system affects the quality of healthcare services as a result of changes in the availability of financial, material, and human resources belonging to this system. The quantitative data, in terms of healthcare characterizing the OECD countries and selected non-member economies, treated as an example of economically developed regions, were chosen for the analysis. The study included five areas of resources, i.e., demographic, financial, human, technical, and the delivery of basic services in healthcare.

Director's Page Investing in Prevention Makes Good Financial Sense You can\u2019t put a dollar value on the losses American families have suffered due to the addiction and overdose crisis. A life lost to overdose is irreplaceable, and the costs to happiness, success, and well-being of those living with addiction are similarly overwhelming and incalculable. Yet, funds are finite, and public health decisions do carry cost implications. When policymakers and community leaders can translate the human benefits of effective treatment and prevention measures into some quantifiable return on that investment, it can be a lever to shift public health policies. Recently in the journal Prevention Science, a group of researchers funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) published an analysis of the costs to North Carolina healthcare payers for hospital charges potentially relating to higher-risk behaviors in patients aged 9-18 (i.e., pre-adolescents and adolescents) in 2012. Charges included care for injuries from violence, accidents, or poisoning; care relating to sexual activity, substance use, or psychiatric disorders; and charges related to suicide or self-inflicted injury. The researchers found that these charges totaled more than $327 million, accounting for more than 10 percent of all hospital-related charges. The higher-risk behaviors associated with these costs are preventable with psychosocial interventions, including family-based prevention programs. Pediatricians and family therapists surveyed in the study supported screening and referral to prevention, but cited possible challenges to reimbursement for these services as well as lack of tr",

During the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, health systems nationwide were forced to rethink and retool nearly every aspect of their operations. In some cases, like the rapid roll out of telehealth, they removed bureaucratic barriers that historically slowed things down. While the pandemic, combined with the resulting economic rollercoaster, raised several immediate challenges, the past few years also exacerbated systemic problems plaguing providers -- rising costs, staffing shortages, evolving payment mechanisms, and an aging patient base, to name a few. These headwinds are enduring, leaving health systems no choice but to embark on large-scale transformation. This article launches a series in which we will examine the dynamics impacting providers and, importantly, how they can respond to ensure they are positioned to stay viable for years to come. Over the next several months, we\u2019ll dive into opportunities for providers to rein in costs, drive growth, expand adoption of value-based care, unleash technology to improve productivity, and remove organizational and cultural barriers to innovation. The Burning Platform Hospitals are experiencing a bit of a Tale of Two Cities scenario. Some financial indicators are pointing up through the first few months of 2024.

Analyses utilized reports from a longitudinal panel of 4,407 participants, followed since the study\u2019s baseline in Grade 5, with most recent follow-up 12 years later at age 23. Impacts on lifetime abstinence from primary outcomes of substance use and antisocial behavior were estimated using generalized linear mixed Poisson regression analysis, adjusted for individual and community-level covariates. Possible cascading effects on 4-year college completion, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder through age 23 were evaluated as secondary outcomes. CTC had a statistically significant global effect on primary outcomes and also on combined primary and secondary outcomes. Among primary outcomes, point estimates suggested absolute improvements in lifetime abstinence of 3.5% to 6.1% in the intervention arm, and relative improvements of 13% to 55%; 95% confidence intervals revealed some uncertainty in estimates.

Quality Improvement Collaboratives (QICs) are often used in healthcare settings to implement proven clinical interventions within local and national programs. The cost of this method of implementation, however, is cited as a barrier to use. This systematic review aims to identify and describe studies reporting on costs and cost-effectiveness of QICs when used to implement clinical guidelines in healthcare. Methods Multiple databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, EconLit and ProQuest) were searched for economic evaluations or cost studies of QICs in healthcare. Studies were included if they reported on economic evaluations or costs of QICs. Two authors independently reviewed citations and full text papers. Key characteristics of eligible studies were extracted, and their quality assessed against the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). Evers CHEC-List was used for full economic evaluations. Cost-effectiveness findings were interpreted through the Johanna Briggs Institute \u2018three by three dominance matrix tool\u2019 to guide conclusions. Currencies were converted to United States dollars for 2018 using OECD and World Bank databases. Results Few studies reported on costs or economic evaluations of QICs despite their use in healthcare. Eight studies across multiple healthcare settings in acute and long-term care, community addiction treatment and chronic disease management were included. Five were considered good quality and favoured the establishment of QICs as cost-effective implementation methods. The cost savings to the healthcare setting identified in these studies outweighed the cost of the coll",

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person. Some of the same concern arises in mixed medical systems with multiple funding sources. 3.1.

The Seventy-sixth World Health Assembly, in decision WHA76(23) (2023), requested the Director-General to submit the updated report and recommendations for further action to the Seventy-seventh World Health Assembly in 2024, through the Executive Board at its 154th session. 2. The present document reports on the progress of the WHO World Report on Social Determinants of Health Equity, which is in preparation and will be published in 2024. Building upon the 2008 report of the WHO Commission on Social Determinants of Health, the updated report will provide an overview of the progress made to date in addressing the recommendations of the Commission, as well as an update of the latest scientific evidence, knowledge and experience from countries in addressing the social determinants of health equity. The report concludes with a set of broad recommendations for Member States to guide future action to improve health equity, which are submitted to the Board for comment. REPORT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS 3. Work on the forthcoming World Report on Social Determinants of Health Equity has been ongoing over a period of two years through a consultative process involving Member States, entities within the United Nations system, non-State actors and WHO teams across the three levels of the Organization. It also draws upon evidence generated for the regional commissions on social determinants of health in the Americas, European and Eastern Mediterranean regions. 4.

Hengameh Hosseini Research output: Contribution to journal \u203a Article \u203a peer-review Abstract As a result of the aging of American society and the fact that older persons require a great deal more healthcare and much more expensive treatments, the costs are on the rise and \u00a0spiraling out of control. As a solution, ethicists Daniel Callahan and others have proposed healthcare rationing on the basis of age. On the basis of utilitarian ethicist, these writers have argued that age-based rationing will lead to the provision of healthcare to the greatest number of people. Of course, utilizing other ethical theories other writers have opposed the rationing of healthcare on the basis of age. The paper presents the arguments made, and the ethical theories employed, by both sides, which suggest an ethical dilemma, thus most probably a debate about age-based rationing in the future. The author found it interesting to seek the views of professors teaching healthcare \u2013related courses about this type of rationing. Utilizing grounded theory/ quantitative research methodology, designing a questionnaire that included some 14 questions, the author interviewed some 18 professors of healthcare courses in Pennsylvania. Utilizing grounded theory in the analysis of the results of the interviews led to some eight interesting themes, which are presented and analyzed in the paper. After presenting the results of that study, and not finding the application of age-based rationing feasible, the paper also discusses other alternative solutions for reducing healthcare costs, including the notion of fair innings suggested by Allan Williams. All these alternatives are discussed in the paper.

The private sector rations access to consumers who are willing and able to pay. The poor and disadvantaged have limited access to care and inadequate income protection. In public health systems, care is provided on the basis of \"need,\" that is, the comparative cost-effectiveness of competing treatments. This results in patients being deprived of care if treatments are clinically effective but not cost-effective. Rationing health care is ubiquitous. In both types of systems physicians have discretion to deviate from these rationing principles. This has created inefficient variations in clinical practice. These are difficult to resolve because of the lack of transparency of costs and patient outcomes and perverse incentives. The failure to remove universal inefficiency in a period of economic austerity sharpens awareness of rationing. Hopes of greater efficiency are largely faith based. Competing ideologues from the left and the right continue to offer evidence for free solutions to long-established problems. Inefficiency is unethical, as it deprives potential patients of care from which they could benefit. Reducing inefficiency is essential but difficult.",

Their arguments were supported by credible references and examples, such as the successful use of ventilator allocation protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic, which demonstrated the practical benefits of a structured rationing system.\n\nThe For side also effectively countered the Against side's concerns about discrimination and the erosion of the doctor-patient relationship by highlighting the existing inequalities in market-based systems and the potential for government intervention to mitigate these disparities. They argued that government-led rationing, guided by medical expertise, can enhance overall well-being and ensure equitable access to healthcare resources.\n\nIn contrast, the Against side focused on the potential risks of government rationing, such as discrimination and the undermining of individual rights, but did not provide a compelling alternative solution to address the scarcity of healthcare resources. Their emphasis on preventative care and public health, while important, did not directly address the immediate challenges of resource allocation during times of scarcity.\n\nOverall, the For side's arguments were more logically coherent, well-supported, and directly addressed the debate topic, making their case for government intervention in healthcare rationing more convincing.",

        "In this debate, we shall argue that when healthcare resources are scarce, government intervention through rationing is justified to maximize societal benefit.  Scarcity refers to the limited availability of healthcare resources relative to demand, and rationing is the controlled distribution of these scarce resources. Government intervention involves actions taken by the government to influence healthcare resource allocation.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. This means government intervention is justified when it leads to the best overall outcomes for society, considering the number of lives saved, quality of life improvements, and equitable distribution of resources.\n\nFirst, government rationing, when guided by evidence-based criteria, can save more lives than an unregulated system.  Triage protocols, used in emergency medicine, offer a model for rationing based on medical need and potential for survival. Studies on disaster response (1) have shown that triage systems, by prioritizing those with the highest chance of survival, can maximize the number of lives saved with limited resources.  A government-led rationing system can apply similar principles on a larger scale, ensuring the most effective use of scarce resources like ICU beds, ventilators, or novel treatments.  For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, some countries successfully used triage protocols to allocate limited ventilators, resulting in better overall outcomes compared to regions with less organized allocation systems (2).  This demonstrates that a systematic, needs-based approach, rather than a first-come, first-served market-based approach, can lead to a more efficient use of scarce resources.\n\nSecond, government intervention ensures equitable distribution of scarce healthcare resources, preventing discrimination based on ability to pay.  Studies consistently show that market-based healthcare systems exacerbate existing inequalities (3).  When healthcare is treated as a commodity, those with greater financial resources have privileged access, while vulnerable populations, including the poor and uninsured, are left behind. This disparity in access directly translates to disparities in health outcomes (4). Government rationing, by prioritizing need over ability to pay, can mitigate these inequalities.  For example, the UK's National Health Service (NHS), a government-run system, provides healthcare based on need, ensuring that everyone, regardless of income, can access essential services (5). While not a perfect system, the NHS demonstrates that government intervention can promote equity in healthcare access.\n\nThird, government has a responsibility to protect its citizens and ensure the effective functioning of essential services, including healthcare.  This responsibility is amplified during times of scarcity.  Just as governments manage resources during natural disasters or wartime, they have a duty to manage scarce healthcare resources to maximize public health outcomes. A coordinated government approach can leverage expertise, data, and infrastructure to implement rationing systems efficiently and effectively.  For instance, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in the US plays a critical role in coordinating public health responses during crises, including developing guidelines for resource allocation (6). This type of centralized coordination, which is beyond the capacity of individual market actors, is essential for managing complex, large-scale healthcare challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, a government-led approach to healthcare rationing, while complex and ethically challenging, is necessary to maximize societal benefit in times of scarcity.  By prioritizing need, promoting equity, and leveraging its unique capabilities, the government can ensure the most effective and just allocation of limited healthcare resources.\n\n\nReference:\n(1)  Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

        "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement misrepresented the critical role of government intervention in healthcare rationing during times of scarcity. They defined rationing as solely a government dictate, neglecting the crucial role of medical professionals and established protocols in ensuring equitable allocation of limited resources. We define rationing as a necessary process, guided by medical expertise and ethical principles, to maximize societal benefit and ensure the most effective use of scarce resources when demand exceeds supply.  Their arguments, focused on individual rights, fail to address the broader societal implications of inaction during scarcity. We will demonstrate how a carefully designed rationing system, rather than infringing upon individual rights, enhances overall well-being by maximizing lives saved and addressing historical inequities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claimed that government rationing infringes upon the right to life. However, this argument ignores the reality that without a structured system for allocating scarce resources, *more* lives may be lost due to inefficient and inequitable distribution.  Rationing, guided by evidence-based triage protocols, aims to maximize the number of lives saved by prioritizing those most likely to benefit from treatment (1).  The successful use of ventilator allocation protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the life-saving potential of rationing in crisis situations (1). This clearly demonstrates that a structured approach to resource allocation ultimately serves to protect, rather than diminish, the right to life, thereby maximizing societal benefit.\n\nSecond, the opponent raised concerns about potential discrimination arising from rationing.  However, they overlook the inherent discrimination embedded within a market-based system, which privileges the wealthy and leaves vulnerable populations behind (2, 3).  Government intervention, through transparent and needs-based rationing criteria, can mitigate these inequalities and promote a more equitable distribution of healthcare resources.  For example, government programs can prioritize access for marginalized communities, addressing historical inequities in healthcare access and ensuring that those most in need receive essential services, thus maximizing benefit for those historically underserved (4).  The UK\u2019s National Health Service exemplifies how government involvement can create a more equitable healthcare system, prioritizing need over ability to pay (5).  This focus on equity significantly contributes to maximizing overall societal benefit.\n\nThird, the opposition suggested that government rationing damages the doctor-patient relationship.  This argument misconstrues the role of rationing guidelines. These guidelines, developed by medical experts, provide a framework for ethical decision-making in times of scarcity, empowering physicians to make difficult choices that prioritize the well-being of the entire patient population. While respecting the importance of individual doctor-patient relationships, we must acknowledge that in times of scarcity, maximizing societal benefit requires difficult choices.  Furthermore, a market-driven system can also compromise the doctor-patient relationship by prioritizing profit over patient need (6). Government regulation, by establishing ethical guidelines and promoting equitable resource allocation, can strengthen the doctor-patient relationship by ensuring that medical decisions are guided by need, not financial pressures, further contributing to maximizing societal benefit.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

        "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the just and equitable allocation of scarce healthcare resources.  The opposition has attempted to portray government intervention as a cold, calculating intrusion into the doctor-patient relationship.  We, however, maintain that a carefully designed system, guided by medical expertise and ethical principles, is not only justifiable but essential to maximizing societal benefit when faced with the difficult reality of scarcity.\n\nThe negative team mischaracterized rationing as a purely governmental dictate. Let\u2019s be clear: rationing, as we advocate, is a medically informed process, utilizing established triage protocols and ethical guidelines, empowering doctors to make the most effective decisions in challenging situations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, for example, ventilator allocation protocols, guided by medical professionals, demonstrably saved lives (1).  These protocols, far from being arbitrary governmental dictates, reflect the best practices of emergency medicine, prioritizing those most likely to benefit from treatment.  Without such structured guidance, allocation becomes arbitrary, potentially favoring those with means over those most in need.\n\nFurthermore, the opposition\u2019s concerns about potential discrimination overlook the stark reality of existing inequalities in market-based healthcare systems.  Where access is determined by ability to pay, those without resources are inherently disadvantaged (2, 3). Government intervention, through transparent needs-based criteria, can mitigate these disparities. Programs like the UK's National Health Service demonstrate that equitable access is achievable through government involvement, prioritizing need over wealth (4).  A regulated system can actively address historical disadvantages, ensuring that vulnerable populations receive the care they deserve. While the negative team raised the specter of implicit rationing harming vulnerable populations, they fail to distinguish this from the explicit, needs-based rationing we advocate, which is specifically designed to counteract those very disparities.\n\nFinally, the claim that government rationing undermines the doctor-patient relationship is a misdirection.  In reality, clear guidelines empower physicians to make ethically sound decisions in times of scarcity. These protocols are developed by medical experts, not politicians, providing a framework for navigating complex ethical dilemmas. The absence of such guidelines can lead to greater uncertainty and erode trust more significantly than a well-designed system.\n\nJustice demands that we prioritize those most in need when resources are limited.  Our approach affirms the fundamental value of every life by ensuring fair access to life-saving care, regardless of socioeconomic status. A market-driven system, on the other hand, inherently prioritizes those with means, leaving the most vulnerable behind.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Dominguez-Cherit G, et al.

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, we\u2019re here today to discuss a critical issue: who decides who gets healthcare when resources are scarce?  The proposition suggests the government should step in and ration care, essentially deciding whose life is worth saving. We strongly oppose this motion.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear what \u201crationing care\u201d means in this context.  It means the government \u2013 not your doctor, not you \u2013 decides who gets life-saving treatment and who doesn\u2019t, based on rules *they* create.\n\nOur opposition rests on three fundamental pillars: your right to life, the risk of discrimination, and the vital importance of the relationship between you and your doctor.\n\nFirst, and most importantly, government rationing of healthcare undermines the very right to life.  This isn\u2019t just about existing; it\u2019s about having a real chance to live.  The journal *Nursing Ethics* published an article, \u201cResource allocation and rationing in nursing care,\u201d which shows how rationing directly impacts 30-day mortality rates.  Think about that: government decisions about who gets care can lead to preventable deaths.  While we understand resources are limited, giving the government the power to choose who lives and dies is incredibly dangerous.  Such a system could easily be abused, prioritizing certain groups over others based on arbitrary criteria, not medical need.\n\nSecond, rationing healthcare based on scarcity opens the door to discrimination, making existing health inequalities even worse.  Studies like those in the *Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics* and the *Hastings Center Report*, titled \u201cDisability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\u201d and \u201cBalancing Health Care Rationing and Disability Rights in a Pandemic\u201d respectively, show how seemingly neutral rationing criteria often disadvantage marginalized groups.  For example, prioritizing those with a \u201chigher chance of survival\u201d can discriminate against people with disabilities or pre-existing conditions.  Imagine if your grandmother, who has a heart condition, was denied life-saving treatment simply because statistically, someone younger might live longer.  Furthermore, implicit rationing, like limited clinics in underserved areas, disproportionately impacts low-income communities, restricting their access to care and worsening their health disadvantages. Government intervention in rationing would solidify these discriminatory practices, creating systemic inequities in our healthcare system.\n\nFinally, government-controlled rationing damages the crucial relationship between you and your doctor, a bond built on trust and personalized care.  David Mechanic\u2019s work on managed care, along with discussions in the book *Rationing Health Care: Public Policy and the Medical Marketplace*, shows how rationing, even when seemingly necessary, harms this vital relationship.  Imagine going to your doctor, the person you trust with your health, only to find they\u2019re forced to follow government mandates instead of focusing on *your* individual needs.  This shift from personalized care to standardized protocols diminishes your autonomy and can lead to decreased compliance and, ultimately, poorer health outcomes.  The ethical implications of breaking this essential trust are profound and cannot be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, while the scarcity of healthcare resources is a serious challenge, government rationing is *not* the answer. It infringes upon the right to life, fosters discrimination, and erodes the patient-physician relationship.  We must find other solutions that address resource limitations without sacrificing these fundamental principles.  We believe a system focused on equitable resource allocation, increased preventative care, and innovative solutions to expand access will better serve everyone while upholding their fundamental rights.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.  Ann Gallagher,  Alison While.

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let\u2019s talk about healthcare.  Think about the last time you or a loved one needed medical attention.  Did you feel confident you\u2019d get the best possible care?  That\u2019s what we all deserve, right?  But what happens when resources are scarce?  The proposition argues for government intervention and rationing.  They say it\u2019s the fairest way, that it maximizes benefits for everyone.  But let\u2019s look closer.\n\n*First*, they claim government rationing ensures equitable allocation.  However, studies, like Mechanic\u2019s work on managed care published in *Health Affairs*, show that even when aiming for fairness, government rationing can erode public trust and damage the vital relationship between patients and doctors. This ultimately harms overall health outcomes.  Furthermore, a scoping review on rationing in healthcare, published in the *International Journal for Equity in Health*, highlights how implicit rationing through things like long wait times and limited clinic access disproportionately burdens vulnerable populations, making existing health disparities even worse. This directly contradicts the idea of equitable allocation.\n\n*Second*, the proposition suggests rationing, guided by protocols, maximizes lives saved.  But is it really that simple?  Think about it.  Resources are limited, potential for discrimination exists, and every human life has immense value. Articles like \u201cEthical rationing of healthcare resources during COVID-19 outbreak\u201d in the *The Lancet* and \u201cThe realities of rationing in health care\u201d in the *British Medical Journal* highlight the tough ethical choices rationing creates, even with guidelines.  Rationing doesn\u2019t guarantee saving the most lives and often comes at a steep ethical cost.\n\n*Third*, they claim government intervention fixes inequalities in market-based systems.  But let\u2019s be real, government rationing creates its own set of problems.  As we\u2019ve seen, it often disadvantages the most vulnerable, the opposite of equitable distribution.  Giving the government so much power also opens the door to potential misuse and bias in resource allocation, potentially marginalizing certain groups.\n\n*Fourth*, and this is crucial, rationing actually *worsens* existing health inequalities.  The article \"Rationing Limited Healthcare Resources in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond\" in *JAMA* shows how rationing strategies, especially those using age cutoffs, can deny essential care to older adults, violating anti-discrimination laws.  While the proposition talks about maximizing benefit by prioritizing those most likely to survive, this ignores the inherent value and rights of *every* individual.  Similarly, \u201cDisability Discrimination, Medical Rationing and COVID-19\u201d in the *Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics* shows how triage protocols can exclude people with disabilities from life-saving treatments, making their lives even harder.  This creates a two-tiered system, widening existing disparities.\n\n*Finally*, we offer a better way: prioritizing preventative care and public health.  Investing in things like vaccinations, health screenings, and education, as discussed in articles like \u201cThe Critical Role of Preventive Health in Reducing Employer Healthcare Costs\u201d in the *Harvard Business Review* and \u201cHow Preventive Care Lowers Health Care Costs\u201d published by the *RAND Corporation*, offers a higher return by tackling the root causes of disease and reducing the need for expensive treatments.  This proactive approach saves resources, improves overall health, and reduces health disparities \u2013 a more sustainable and equitable solution.\n\nSo, let\u2019s reject government rationing and support a fairer, more effective approach to healthcare. Let\u2019s invest in prevention and public health, building a healthier future for all of us.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.

        "Friends, jurors, let\u2019s talk healthcare. We all know healthcare resources are limited \u2013 it\u2019s *how* we deal with this that matters.  The other side says government-controlled rationing is the fairest, most effective way. We strongly disagree. They talk about objective criteria, saving the most lives. But they miss a *huge* point: the danger of giving government the power to decide who lives and who dies.\n\nOur argument is simple:  It\u2019s about the right to life, fair access, and that crucial bond between doctor and patient.  They say rationing saves the most lives. But what about bias? What about the inequalities already baked into the system?  Think about ventilator allocation \u2013 sure, it might work in a crisis, but what about long-term care? Studies show even \u201cneutral\u201d rules often hurt the most vulnerable. That\u2019s not fair access, that\u2019s discrimination, plain and simple.  \n\nAnd saying the government fixes inequality?  Think again.  Government control can easily become a tool for picking favorites, deciding who gets care based on who knows what, not medical need.  That\u2019s not right. They point to the UK\u2019s system, but even *they* have arguments about waiting lists and who gets what.\n\nFinally, they say rationing empowers doctors.  We say it does the opposite. It forces doctors to become gatekeepers, not advocates.  Imagine your doctor saying, \u201cSorry, there\u2019s just not enough to go around.\u201d That breaks down trust, and that\u2019s bad for everyone\u2019s health.\n\nWe believe in a different way.  Preventative care. Public health. Investing in *these* things means fewer expensive treatments, tackling the root causes of illness, and a healthier community for all of us.  That\u2019s a better solution, a fairer solution.  Let\u2019s reject government rationing and build a future where healthcare is a right, not a privilege handed out by the government.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.  Gallagher, Ann, and Alison While. \"Resource allocation and rationing in nursing care: A discussion paper.\" *Nursing Ethics* (2019).\n2.
