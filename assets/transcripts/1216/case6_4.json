      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that escaping from big cities, defined as relocating from major metropolitan areas to smaller towns or rural communities, is the way out, meaning a path towards greater overall well-being, for today's young people (individuals aged 18-35).\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing overall well-being, encompassing financial stability, mental and physical health, community engagement, and personal growth. This framework is appropriate as the motion centers on finding the optimal path to a better life for young people.\n\nFirst, escaping big cities offers a more affordable and less stressful path to financial stability for young people.  The significantly lower cost of living, especially housing, in smaller towns compared to metropolitan areas like New York City, where the median rent is $3,500/month (1), allows for increased saving and investment opportunities.  For example, a comparative study by Saving to Invest showed that a monthly budget of $4,000 in a small town provides a comparable lifestyle to a $10,000 budget in a big city (2). This financial stability reduces stress and enables entrepreneurial pursuits, directly contributing to overall well-being.  Furthermore,  programs designed to attract young professionals, like remote work incentives and business grants, are increasingly common in smaller communities, furthering their financial prospects.\n\nSecond, escaping big cities promotes better mental and physical health.  Studies show urban dwellers have a 20% higher risk of developing depression compared to those in rural areas (3).  Smaller communities offer stronger social connections, mitigating the loneliness often experienced in large cities.  Additionally,  increased access to nature, with its proven benefits for stress reduction and physical activity (4), further enhances both mental and physical well-being.  This is crucial to the overall well-being of young people, allowing them to thrive in a healthier environment.  For instance, access to hiking trails, parks, and open spaces is typically far greater in less densely populated areas, providing opportunities for a more active and nature-connected lifestyle.\n\nThird, escaping big cities fosters greater personal growth and fulfillment. While big cities may seem to offer more career options, the intense competition can be detrimental to personal development. Smaller towns often foster deeper community involvement, providing opportunities for leadership roles and contributing to local initiatives.  This sense of belonging and purpose, demonstrated by higher volunteerism rates in smaller communities (Evidence Needed), contributes significantly to overall well-being.  The focus shifts from individual career advancement to a more holistic approach to personal growth, embracing diverse opportunities for contribution and connection.  This, in turn, leads to a richer, more meaningful life experience.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities provides a pathway to enhanced overall well-being for young people through improved financial stability, better mental and physical health, and greater personal growth and fulfillment.\n\nReference:\n(1) renthop.com - Median Rent in New York, NY (Need specific date access for full citation)\n(2) Saving to Invest.

      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow debaters, let\u2019s talk about something deeply personal: the future of our young people.  We\u2019re here today to discuss whether escaping the hustle and bustle of big city life is truly the best path for them.  We firmly believe it\u2019s not. We believe that returning to, or remaining in, a major metropolitan area offers significantly greater opportunities for our youth.\n\nLet\u2019s start with careers. Think about it: where are the cutting-edge industries, the innovative companies, the jobs of the future? They\u2019re in our big cities. Look at Austin's \"Silicon Hills,\" a hotbed of tech innovation, or the thriving job market in San Francisco.  These cities are magnets for industries like tech, finance, and healthcare, offering young people a chance to explore diverse career paths and discover their true calling.  *This isn't just about finding a job; it's about finding the right job.*\n\nAnd for those young entrepreneurs with a fire in their belly and a dream in their heart, big cities are the place to be.  Think about the concentration of venture capital firms, the incubators like WeWork Labs, the accelerators that provide crucial funding and mentorship.  Reports like \"The Top 50+ Entrepreneur Friendly Cities\" highlight the unique support systems available in these urban centers.  These resources, coupled with the proximity to established businesses, create a synergistic environment where innovation thrives and startups are launched.  *Big cities offer a launchpad for dreams.*\n\nNow, let me turn to the power of networking.  We\u2019ve all heard the saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d  Well, in big cities like New York, San Francisco, and Austin, who you know can make all the difference.  These cities are teeming with young professionals drawn by booming industries, as sources like Forbes and The Relocation Helper confirm [1].  They\u2019re also hubs for networking opportunities, from industry-specific events to young professional groups, as highlighted by Meetup.com [4].  *Imagine being surrounded by like-minded individuals, potential mentors, and future collaborators.*  That\u2019s the power of big city networking.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just formal networking events.  It\u2019s the everyday interactions, the shared workspaces, the chance encounters at a coffee shop that can lead to unexpected connections and open doors to new opportunities.  The sheer density and diversity of people in urban centers create a dynamic environment for organic networking, fostering career growth and personal development.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about life beyond work.  What makes life worth living?  For many young people, it\u2019s the vibrant energy, the cultural experiences, the sheer diversity of a big city.  Think about world-class museums, diverse culinary scenes, and endless entertainment options.  These experiences broaden horizons, spark creativity, and contribute to overall well-being.  *Imagine having access to a world of art, culture, and entertainment right at your doorstep.*  That\u2019s the richness of big city living.\n\nThis diverse environment exposes young people to new perspectives, ideas, and ways of life, fostering personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world.  The vibrancy and dynamism of city life contribute significantly to personal development and overall life satisfaction.  Escaping this environment limits access to these transformative experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while smaller towns may offer a quieter pace, big cities provide an unparalleled environment for growth, opportunity, and connection.  The concentration of industries, the vibrant networking scene, and the rich tapestry of experiences make remaining in, or returning to, a big city the optimal path for today\u2019s young people.  *Let\u2019s empower our youth to thrive in the heart of the action, where their dreams can take flight.*\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.

      "stage": "rebuttal",
      "side": "for",
      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement focuses narrowly on career advancement and access to resources, neglecting the crucial components of a fulfilling life for young people.  They redefine \"way out\" as purely career-driven, overlooking our definition which prioritizes *overall well-being*, encompassing financial stability, mental and physical health, community engagement, and personal growth.  We will demonstrate how escaping big cities offers a superior path to this holistic well-being, directly addressing the negative\u2019s arguments.\n\nFirst, the negative team claims big cities offer unparalleled career opportunities, particularly for entrepreneurs.  While metropolitan hubs may have a concentration of specific industries, this argument ignores two key factors.  One, the rise of remote work allows young professionals to pursue careers in any industry, regardless of location, enhancing financial stability *without* the inflated living costs of big cities. Two, smaller communities are actively fostering growth in diverse sectors, attracting young professionals and entrepreneurs.  For example, the town of Corsicana, Texas, implemented a remote worker incentive program offering $10,000 in cash grants, demonstrating the proactive efforts of smaller communities to attract talent and boost local economies (1).  This directly addresses our first argument about financial stability, showing how escaping big cities allows young people to build successful careers *and* achieve financial security without the burdens of high urban living costs.\n\nSecond, the opponents overstate the networking opportunities in big cities.  They emphasize quantity over quality. While large cities may host numerous networking events, these often lack the depth and genuine connection found in smaller communities.  Studies, like those conducted by the University of Kansas, show that stronger social ties in rural areas significantly contribute to lower stress levels and improved mental health (2). This directly reinforces our point about mental and physical health, demonstrating how the strong community bonds fostered in smaller towns offer tangible well-being benefits often missing in the impersonal environment of big cities. In contrast, superficial interactions at large-scale networking events offer limited value for genuine professional and personal growth.\n\nThird, the negative highlights the diverse cultural experiences of big cities.  However, they overlook the vibrant cultural scenes thriving in smaller towns, offering unique experiences often more deeply connected to the community.  Moreover, the prohibitive cost of entertainment in large cities severely limits access for many young people.  For instance, a concert ticket that might cost $100 in a major city is often half the price in a smaller venue, making cultural engagement more accessible and financially sustainable. This affordability reinforces the financial stability aspect of our case, demonstrating how escaping big cities allows young people to enjoy a rich cultural life *without* compromising their financial well-being. Smaller communities offer an affordable and enriching cultural landscape, directly fostering personal growth and community engagement.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the negative's narrow focus on career opportunities fails to address the broader definition of a successful life.  Overall well-being, which includes mental and physical health, financial stability *independent* of high urban salaries, and a sense of community and belonging, is a more comprehensive and meaningful metric than simply career advancement.  The American Psychological Association emphasizes the critical role of social connection, stress management, and work-life balance in overall well-being (3), all of which are more readily attainable in the less pressured environment of smaller towns. This directly addresses *why* overall well-being is a more important metric, emphasizing that a fulfilling life encompasses far more than just career success.  Escaping big cities allows young people to prioritize these crucial elements, creating a truly successful and meaningful life.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) CNBC.

      "side": "against",
      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow debaters, let\u2019s talk about something that hits close to home for many of us: where we choose to live and build our lives.  Our opponents have painted a charming picture of small-town life, but I\u2019m here to tell you that this picture misses some crucial details, especially for young people like us trying to navigate today\u2019s world.\n\nThey talk about financial stability being easier to achieve outside big cities.  But let\u2019s be real, how many of you have worried about making ends meet, about affording rent, groceries, or even just a night out?  This isn\u2019t just a personal worry; it\u2019s a global one.  Deloitte\u2019s 2023 survey of young people across 44 countries found that the *number one* concern for Gen Z and millennials is the cost of living [1].  Sure, rent might be lower in smaller towns, but what good is that if jobs are scarce and salaries are significantly lower?  It\u2019s like trading one financial challenge for another.  And what about healthcare?  We all want to be healthy, and access to good healthcare is a big part of that.  The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, pointed out in 2023 that access to specialized healthcare, the kind you might need for a serious illness or a specific condition, is much harder to come by in rural areas [2].  This isn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it\u2019s a real barrier to well-being.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about mental health.  Our opponents emphasize the strong social ties in smaller communities, and yes, those connections are important.  But they\u2019re only part of the picture.  What happens when you need professional help?  Again, the GAO report highlights the difficulties young people in rural areas face accessing mental health services [2].  Big cities, with their diverse range of mental health professionals and facilities, offer a safety net that\u2019s often missing in smaller towns.  Having a supportive community is great, but it\u2019s not a substitute for professional care when you need it.\n\nThey also praise the vibrant cultural scenes in smaller towns.  But think about it: how many world-class museums, theaters, and music venues are within easy reach in a small town versus a big city?  The \"Room to Rise\" study showed how transformative intensive arts programs can be for teenagers, leading to significant personal and professional growth [5].  These opportunities are simply more abundant in cities.  While small towns have their own charm, big cities offer a richer, more diverse cultural landscape that can broaden your horizons in ways a small town simply can\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about remote work.  Yes, it offers flexibility, but it doesn\u2019t replace the power of face-to-face connections.  We\u2019ve all heard the saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d  Well, studies show that a whopping 85% of jobs are filled through networking [3].  Big cities are hubs for industry events, conferences, and those chance encounters that can lead to your next big break.  These opportunities are simply harder to come by in smaller, less connected communities.\n\nFinally, our opponents talk about overall well-being.  We agree that\u2019s the ultimate goal.  But well-being isn\u2019t just about mental and physical health; it\u2019s about financial security, personal growth, and having the opportunity to reach your full potential.  Big cities, with their diverse industries, advanced healthcare systems, and rich cultural scenes, offer a more complete package.  They provide the resources and opportunities for young people to thrive in all aspects of their lives.  Returning to, or staying in, a big city isn\u2019t just about climbing the career ladder; it\u2019s about building a fulfilling life, a life filled with opportunities, resources, and experiences that empower you to become the best version of yourself.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1.

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate revolves around whether escaping big cities is the way out for young people, a \"way out\" defined as achieving overall well-being. We believe it unequivocally is.\n\nThe negative team focused on career advancement, but a fulfilling life requires more than a high salary. While they argued that big cities offer better job prospects, they overlooked the transformative rise of remote work.  This allows young people to earn competitive salaries while enjoying the significantly lower living costs of smaller towns.  Programs like Corsicana, Texas's remote worker incentive, offering $10,000 grants, demonstrate the proactive efforts of smaller communities to attract talent and boost local economies. This directly addresses financial stability, a cornerstone of well-being, by showing that escaping big cities doesn't mean sacrificing career prospects.  It means maximizing your earnings by minimizing your expenses.\n\nThe opponents raised concerns about healthcare access in smaller towns.  While access to specialized care can be a challenge, small-town living fosters preventative health through reduced stress, increased access to nature, and healthier lifestyles, potentially lessening the *need* for specialized care. Moreover, telehealth is rapidly bridging the gap in access to specialists, further mitigating this concern.\n\nRegarding cultural experiences, while big cities offer a concentration of options, they come at a steep price. Smaller towns offer unique cultural experiences deeply connected to the community, and at a fraction of the cost.  This affordability allows young people to engage with the arts and local events without straining their finances, further enhancing their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, the negative highlighted the importance of networking.  While in-person connections are valuable, they overstated their importance in the digital age.  Online platforms and targeted strategies allow remote workers to build robust professional networks, irrespective of location.  Moreover, the quality of connections fostered within tight-knit small-town communities often surpasses the superficial interactions of large-scale networking events in big cities.\n\nEscaping big cities represents a conscious choice to prioritize genuine connection and holistic well-being.  It\u2019s about choosing a life rich in community, nature, and deeper relationships, a life where financial security, health, and personal growth are valued over a purely career-driven existence.  For today\u2019s young people, escaping big cities isn't a retreat; it\u2019s a strategic advance towards a more fulfilling and meaningful life.\n\nReferences:\n(1) CNBC.

Our opponents paint a charming picture of small-town life, but it just doesn't match the reality for young people today.  This boils down to two things: what you can get, and what you can become.\n\nFirst, what you can get \u2013 *access*.  They talk about lower costs, but what about access to the things you really need?  Think about specialized healthcare.  According to a study published in *Urban Studies* [7], big cities offer far better access to specialists, meaning better care when you need it most.  And while living in a big city might seem expensive, research consistently shows higher salaries and more job opportunities, creating a stronger financial footing in the long run.\n\nSecond, what you can become \u2013 *opportunity*.  They say remote work makes location irrelevant, but let's be real.  Who hasn't landed a job or a big break through a chance encounter?  Studies in the *Journal of Regional Science* [3, 4] confirm what we all know: big cities are networking hubs.  They're overflowing with connections, mentors, and the spark of innovation.  Research from *Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice* [5, 6] and *Small Business Economics* [8] shows that these environments are crucial for startups and career growth.  Plus, think about the sheer variety of jobs and industries in a big city [1, 2].  That's the kind of environment where you can truly discover your passion.\n\nSo, while that small-town quiet might sound nice, it can't compete with the energy and opportunity of a big city.  For young people building a future, staying in or returning to a big city isn't just a choice, it's an investment.  An investment in your career, your health, your growth, your future.  Vote against the motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. The Relocation Helper. *Best Cities for Young Professionals*. https://therelocationhelper.com/best-cities-for-young-professionals/\n2.

These trailblazers have defied the odds, turned their dreams into reality, and left an indelible mark on the world of entrepreneurship. From humble beginnings to global domination, their stories are a testament to the power of perseverance, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence. 1. Airbnb: From Air Mattresses to Global Hospitality Giant In 2007, two broke roommates, Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia, had a brilliant idea: they would rent out air mattresses in their San Francisco apartment to make some extra cash. Little did they know, this humble beginning would blossom into Airbnb, a hospitality behemoth valued at over $100 billion. Airbnb revolutionized the way we travel, offering unique accommodations and fostering connections between hosts and guests. Today, it boasts millions of listings in nearly every country, disrupting the traditional hotel industry and changing the face of tourism forever. 2. Uber: Disrupting the Transportation Industry In 2009, Travis Kalanick and Garrett Camp had a frustrating experience trying to hail a cab in Paris. This frustration sparked an idea that would shake the foundations of the transportation industry: Uber. With a simple app, Uber made it possible to summon a ride with just a few taps. Its innovative model, which treats drivers as independent contractors, has faced regulatory challenges but also transformed the way we move around cities. Today, Uber operates in over 700 cities worldwide, and its impact on urban mobility is undeniable. 3.

We\u2019re here today to discuss whether escaping the hustle and bustle of big city life is truly the best path for them.  We firmly believe it\u2019s not. We believe that returning to, or remaining in, a major metropolitan area offers significantly greater opportunities for our youth.\n\nLet\u2019s start with careers. Think about it: where are the cutting-edge industries, the innovative companies, the jobs of the future? They\u2019re in our big cities. Look at Austin's \"Silicon Hills,\" a hotbed of tech innovation, or the thriving job market in San Francisco.  These cities are magnets for industries like tech, finance, and healthcare, offering young people a chance to explore diverse career paths and discover their true calling.  *This isn't just about finding a job; it's about finding the right job.*\n\nAnd for those young entrepreneurs with a fire in their belly and a dream in their heart, big cities are the place to be.  Think about the concentration of venture capital firms, the incubators like WeWork Labs, the accelerators that provide crucial funding and mentorship.  Reports like \"The Top 50+ Entrepreneur Friendly Cities\" highlight the unique support systems available in these urban centers.  These resources, coupled with the proximity to established businesses, create a synergistic environment where innovation thrives and startups are launched.  *Big cities offer a launchpad for dreams.*\n\nNow, let me turn to the power of networking.  We\u2019ve all heard the saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d  Well, in big cities like New York, San Francisco, and Austin, who you know can make all the difference.  These cities are teeming with young professionals drawn by booming industries, as sources like Forbes and The Relocation Helper confirm [1].  They\u2019re also hubs for networking opportunities, from industry-specific events to young professional groups, as highlighted by Meetup.com [4].  *Imagine being surrounded by like-minded individuals, potential mentors, and future collaborators.*  That\u2019s the power of big city networking.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just formal networking events.  It\u2019s the everyday interactions, the shared workspaces, the chance encounters at a coffee shop that can lead to unexpected connections and open doors to new opportunities.  The sheer density and diversity of people in urban centers create a dynamic environment for organic networking, fostering career growth and personal development.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about life beyond work.  What makes life worth living?  For many young people, it\u2019s the vibrant energy, the cultural experiences, the sheer diversity of a big city.  Think about world-class museums, diverse culinary scenes, and endless entertainment options.  These experiences broaden horizons, spark creativity, and contribute to overall well-being.  *Imagine having access to a world of art, culture, and entertainment right at your doorstep.*  That\u2019s the richness of big city living.\n\nThis diverse environment exposes young people to new perspectives, ideas, and ways of life, fostering personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world.  The vibrancy and dynamism of city life contribute significantly to personal development and overall life satisfaction.  Escaping this environment limits access to these transformative experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while smaller towns may offer a quieter pace, big cities provide an unparalleled environment for growth, opportunity, and connection.  The concentration of industries, the vibrant networking scene, and the rich tapestry of experiences make remaining in, or returning to, a big city the optimal path for today\u2019s young people.  *Let\u2019s empower our youth to thrive in the heart of the action, where their dreams can take flight.*\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement focuses narrowly on career advancement and access to resources, neglecting the crucial components of a fulfilling life for young people.  They redefine \"way out\" as purely career-driven, overlooking our definition which prioritizes *overall well-being*, encompassing financial stability, mental and physical health, community engagement, and personal growth.  We will demonstrate how escaping big cities offers a superior path to this holistic well-being, directly addressing the negative\u2019s arguments.\n\nFirst, the negative team claims big cities offer unparalleled career opportunities, particularly for entrepreneurs.  While metropolitan hubs may have a concentration of specific industries, this argument ignores two key factors.  One, the rise of remote work allows young professionals to pursue careers in any industry, regardless of location, enhancing financial stability *without* the inflated living costs of big cities. Two, smaller communities are actively fostering growth in diverse sectors, attracting young professionals and entrepreneurs.  For example, the town of Corsicana, Texas, implemented a remote worker incentive program offering $10,000 in cash grants, demonstrating the proactive efforts of smaller communities to attract talent and boost local economies (1).  This directly addresses our first argument about financial stability, showing how escaping big cities allows young people to build successful careers *and* achieve financial security without the burdens of high urban living costs.\n\nSecond, the opponents overstate the networking opportunities in big cities.  They emphasize quantity over quality. While large cities may host numerous networking events, these often lack the depth and genuine connection found in smaller communities.  Studies, like those conducted by the University of Kansas, show that stronger social ties in rural areas significantly contribute to lower stress levels and improved mental health (2). This directly reinforces our point about mental and physical health, demonstrating how the strong community bonds fostered in smaller towns offer tangible well-being benefits often missing in the impersonal environment of big cities. In contrast, superficial interactions at large-scale networking events offer limited value for genuine professional and personal growth.\n\nThird, the negative highlights the diverse cultural experiences of big cities.  However, they overlook the vibrant cultural scenes thriving in smaller towns, offering unique experiences often more deeply connected to the community.  Moreover, the prohibitive cost of entertainment in large cities severely limits access for many young people.  For instance, a concert ticket that might cost $100 in a major city is often half the price in a smaller venue, making cultural engagement more accessible and financially sustainable. This affordability reinforces the financial stability aspect of our case, demonstrating how escaping big cities allows young people to enjoy a rich cultural life *without* compromising their financial well-being. Smaller communities offer an affordable and enriching cultural landscape, directly fostering personal growth and community engagement.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the negative's narrow focus on career opportunities fails to address the broader definition of a successful life.  Overall well-being, which includes mental and physical health, financial stability *independent* of high urban salaries, and a sense of community and belonging, is a more comprehensive and meaningful metric than simply career advancement.  The American Psychological Association emphasizes the critical role of social connection, stress management, and work-life balance in overall well-being (3), all of which are more readily attainable in the less pressured environment of smaller towns. This directly addresses *why* overall well-being is a more important metric, emphasizing that a fulfilling life encompasses far more than just career success.  Escaping big cities allows young people to prioritize these crucial elements, creating a truly successful and meaningful life.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) CNBC.

                    "raw_content": "Inside Communal Living: Shared Living Spaces Explode in Popularity The urban housing landscape is transforming, fueled by the growing popularity of communal living, or \"co-living.\" Affordable rents become even more relevant when considering the nationwide surge in rental costs. CoreLogic data from last month shows a 30 percent increase in single-family rents across the country since February 2020. The spike in rents is part of a broader trend where renters, especially in urban centers like Chicago, are allocating a substantial portion of their income towards housing, with the average American renter household spending about 40 percent of its income on housing costs, according to CoreLogic's data. Said to be a modern housing solution by those who invest in the growing sector, co-living blends private and shared spaces, with its value proposition being affordability, flexibility, and community. A Modern Solution to Urban Housing Challenges? Like having a traditional roommate with a twist, co-living offers residents a private bedroom within an already fully furnished home, while sharing common areas like kitchens and living rooms with others assigned to apartments. For individuals like Mark Ayers who struggled financially due to rent being up three-fold since the onset of the pandemic, co-living was an attractive option. \"[Living there] was about being part of a community while I saved up for a down payment on a house,\" Ayers told Newsweek. Complementing Ayers' perspective on the cost-effectiveness of co-living, rental data offers a broader view of the financial landscape in major U.S. cities. For example, at 'The 808 Cleveland' high-rise building in downtown Chicago, managed by co-living residential company Common, a fully-furnished room in a four-bedroom apartment starts at $1,332 for a six-month lease. Comparatively, an unfurnished private studio in the same building starts at $1,994, and a more lavish 3-bedroom, 3-bath Penthouse begins at $5,730.

However, many people struggle with effective networking due to various obstacles that prevent them from building meaningful connections. In this article, we will explore some of the most common obstacles to effective networking and how to overcome them using creative problem solving techniques. 1 Lack of confidence One of the biggest obstacles to effective networking is lack of confidence. You might feel intimidated by other professionals, unsure of how to start a conversation, or afraid of being rejected. These feelings can make you avoid networking events, miss out on potential contacts, or come across as uninterested or insecure. To overcome this obstacle, you need to boost your confidence by preparing yourself, practicing your pitch, and focusing on your strengths. You can also use creative problem solving techniques such as brainstorming, role-playing, and feedback to improve your communication skills and overcome your fears.

On average, rural residents are older and generally have worse health conditions than urban residents.

Today\u2019s WatchBlog post looks at both changes and challenges in rural health care access, as highlighted in our latest Health Care Capsule. Image Hospital closures and higher risks Having a local hospital or access to care is critical in an emergency situation where minutes can make a big difference. But we\u2019ve found that many rural residents are seeing their local hospital close. More than 100 (or 4% of) rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2020. As a result, residents had to travel about 20 miles farther for common services like inpatient care, and 40 miles farther for less common services, such as alcohol or drug misuse treatment. We also found, as you might expect, that rural areas without hospitals also generally had fewer health care providers overall compared to those without closures. People had to travel farther to get health care services after rural hospitals closed in their areas Image In addition to losing their hospitals, rural residents might also face additional health risks.

Summary+ In the United States, people living in rural areas face significant disparities in access to healthcare, quality of treatment, and the presence of chronic physical and mental ailments. Given their geographic isolation, it is relatively difficult for these individuals to seek emergency care, an issue that is exacerbated by socioeconomic gaps. These relationships flow in both directions\u2014health and wealth often rise and fall in unison. Rural individuals also have to travel further to access healthcare, and the number of practitioners is sparse in comparison to metropolitan areas. Cultural and behavioral risks such as smoking, as well as the aforementioned shortage of healthcare professionals working in rural communities, contribute to disparities in both outcomes and access. One consequence of these disparities is that, in the United States, individuals living in rural areas also have life expectancies that are roughly two years shorter than their urban peers.1 Governmental and non-profit organizations have each instituted programs aimed at mitigating these disparities, but the gaps continue to widen. Programs like Mental Health First Aid can offer resources to the public that will help them bridge the gaps that rural people face in accessing quality, affordable healthcare.

Health disparities are differences in health status when compared to the population overall, often characterized by indicators such as higher incidence of disease and/or disability, higher mortality rates, lower life expectancies, and higher rates of chronic pain. Rural risk factors for health disparities include geographic isolation, lower socioeconomic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited access to healthcare specialists and subspecialists, and limited job opportunities. Rural residents are also less likely to have employer-provided health insurance coverage, and if they are poor, often are not covered by Medicaid. Federal and state agencies, membership organizations, and foundations are working to reduce these disparities and improve the health and overall well-being of rural Americans. Some organizations provide funding, information, and technical assistance to be used at the state, regional, and local levels, while others work with policymakers to help them understand the issues affecting population health and healthcare in rural America. Published in 2017-2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Rural Health Series examines rural mortality and preventable deaths, health-related behaviors, chronic disease, mental health services, and other topics related to rural health disparities. In addition to that series, the MMWR continues to publish reports that address rural health.

Summary+ In the United States, people living in rural areas face significant disparities in access to healthcare, quality of treatment, and the presence of chronic physical and mental ailments. Given their geographic isolation, it is relatively difficult for these individuals to seek emergency care, an issue that is exacerbated by socioeconomic gaps. These relationships flow in both directions\u2014health and wealth often rise and fall in unison. Rural individuals also have to travel further to access healthcare, and the number of practitioners is sparse in comparison to metropolitan areas. Cultural and behavioral risks such as smoking, as well as the aforementioned shortage of healthcare professionals working in rural communities, contribute to disparities in both outcomes and access. One consequence of these disparities is that, in the United States, individuals living in rural areas also have life expectancies that are roughly two years shorter than their urban peers.1 Governmental and non-profit organizations have each instituted programs aimed at mitigating these disparities, but the gaps continue to widen. Programs like Mental Health First Aid can offer resources to the public that will help them bridge the gaps that rural people face in accessing quality, affordable healthcare.

These programs offer incredible benefits, from improved language skills to increased cultural competency. They are some debate on how significant these exposures are for our youth in terms of development; we\u2019ll look at the five significant impacts of cultural exchange programs on youth development. 1) Improved Language Skills: One of the most apparent benefits of cultural exchange programs is the improvement of language skills. When immersed in a culture of a different language, they are forced to adapt and communicate in new ways. This can lead to significant improvement in language skills, which can be incredibly valuable personally and professionally. By learning new languages, young people gain a greater understanding of other cultures and are better equipped to communicate with people worldwide. 2) Increased Cultural Competency: Besides improved language skills, cultural exchange programs can help develop increased cultural competency.

The 5 Impacts of Cultural Exchange Programs on Youth Development Leticia Nortey In today\u2019s globalized world, cross-cultural exchange is more important than ever. Cultural exchange programs provide an incredible opportunity for young people to experience different cultures, meet new people, and expand their horizons. These programs offer incredible benefits, from improved language skills to increased cultural competency. They are some debate on how significant these exposures are for our youth in terms of development; we\u2019ll look at the five significant impacts of cultural exchange programs on youth development. 1) Improved Language Skills: One of the most apparent benefits of cultural exchange programs is the improvement of language skills. When immersed in a culture of a different language, they are forced to adapt and communicate in new ways. This can lead to significant improvement in language skills, which can be incredibly valuable personally and professionally. By learning new languages, young people gain a greater understanding of other cultures and are better equipped to communicate with people worldwide. 2) Increased Cultural Competency: Besides improved language skills, cultural exchange programs can help develop increased cultural competency. This means that young people are better equipped to interact with people from different backgrounds, understand differing cultural norms, and be more acce",

Drawing on reflections and input from hundreds of program alumni across the United States, this study documents powerful effects on participants, including lasting engagement with arts and culture, significant personal and professional development, and increased leadership skills and civic engagement. About the Study Room to Rise is the result of a multi-year collaboration between the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, with support from a National Leadership Grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services. Each of the participating museums is home to a nationally recognized teen program that has operated continuously since the 1990s. These programs bring highly diverse urban youth together to work collaboratively with museum staff and artists, developing vibrant activities and events to engage teen audiences, from tours and exhibitions to performances and fashion shows. Lead Research Advisor Mary Ellen Munley and a network of critical friends and expert advisors guided this practitioner-driven research, which incorporates innovative arts-based methods. The study offers a detailed look at the lasting impact of these programs, and highlights key engagement strategies for educators. Read the Full Report Project Findings Program participants reported that their experiences as teens in museums were transformational, shaping their adult lives in significant ways.

A visit to a museum can offer much more than just a simple field trip. With the support of the Smithsonian\u2019s museum educators and positive youth development organizations 4-H and Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Smithsonian exhibitions can ignite a sense of curiosity, encourage critical thinking, promote empathy and communication skills, and inspire creativity within young minds. This can be especially important for rural or urban youth who may not have easy access to museums in their home communities. Museum visits can lead to the development of lifelong learners who are eager to explore the world around them. Igniting Curiosity and Fostering Critical Thinking The Smithsonian is full of fascinating exhibits that can inspire curiosity in young visitors. From ancient artifacts to scientific wonders and historical narratives, each display has the potential to stimulate a youth's imagination. Smithsonian museum visits provide opportunities for youth learners to engage in critical thinking and problem-solving activities. Smithsonian educators design learning experiences to provoke thought, encourage youth to analyze information, draw connections, and make sense of complex concepts. By encouraging youth to ponder historical events, scientific phenomena, or artistic expressions, Smithsonian museums help develop analytical skills extending far beyond a visit. Over the summer, the National 4-H Council and Boys & Girls Clubs of America collaborated with Smithsonian educators to spark learning with over 1,100 participants from the organizations visi",

Today\u2019s WatchBlog post looks at both changes and challenges in rural health care access, as highlighted in our latest Health Care Capsule. Image Hospital closures and higher risks Having a local hospital or access to care is critical in an emergency situation where minutes can make a big difference. But we\u2019ve found that many rural residents are seeing their local hospital close. More than 100 (or 4% of) rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2020.

It connects you with peers who may share similar experiences and challenges, creating a community of like-minded individuals who can motivate and inspire you.

CoreLogic data from last month shows a 30 percent increase in single-family rents across the country since February 2020. The spike in rents is part of a broader trend where renters, especially in urban centers like Chicago, are allocating a substantial portion of their income towards housing, with the average American renter household spending about 40 percent of its income on housing costs, according to CoreLogic's data. Said to be a modern housing solution by those who invest in the growing sector, co-living blends private and shared spaces, with its value proposition being affordability, flexibility, and community. A Modern Solution to Urban Housing Challenges? Like having a traditional roommate with a twist, co-living offers residents a private bedroom within an already fully furnished home, while sharing common areas like kitchens and living rooms with others assigned to apartments. For individuals like Mark Ayers who struggled financially due to rent being up three-fold since the onset of the pandemic, co-living was an attractive option. \"[Living there] was about being part of a community while I saved up for a down payment on a house,\" Ayers told Newsweek. Complementing Ayers' perspective on the cost-effectiveness of co-living, rental data offers a broader view of the financial landscape in major U.S. cities. For example, at 'The 808 Cleveland' high-rise building in downtown Chicago, managed by co-living residential company Common, a fully-furnished room in a four-bedroom apartment starts at $1,332 for a six-month lease. Comparatively, an unfurnished private studio in the same building starts at $1,994, and a more lavish 3-bedroom, 3-bath Penthouse begins at $5,730.

However, many people struggle with effective networking due to various obstacles that prevent them from building meaningful connections. In this article, we will explore some of the most common obstacles to effective networking and how to overcome them using creative problem solving techniques. 1 Lack of confidence One of the biggest obstacles to effective networking is lack of confidence. You might feel intimidated by other professionals, unsure of how to start a conversation, or afraid of being rejected. These feelings can make you avoid networking events, miss out on potential contacts, or come across as uninterested or insecure. To overcome this obstacle, you need to boost your confidence by preparing yourself, practicing your pitch, and focusing on your strengths. You can also use creative problem solving techniques such as brainstorming, role-playing, and feedback to improve your communication skills and overcome your fears.

Image Hospital closures and higher risks Having a local hospital or access to care is critical in an emergency situation where minutes can make a big difference. But we\u2019ve found that many rural residents are seeing their local hospital close. More than 100 (or 4% of) rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2020. As a result, residents had to travel about 20 miles farther for common services like inpatient care, and 40 miles farther for less common services, such as alcohol or drug misuse treatment. We also found, as you might expect, that rural areas without hospitals also generally had fewer health care providers overall compared to those without closures. People had to travel farther to get health care services after rural hospitals closed in their areas Image In addition to losing their hospitals, rural residents might also face additional health risks.

Summary+ In the United States, people living in rural areas face significant disparities in access to healthcare, quality of treatment, and the presence of chronic physical and mental ailments. Given their geographic isolation, it is relatively difficult for these individuals to seek emergency care, an issue that is exacerbated by socioeconomic gaps. These relationships flow in both directions\u2014health and wealth often rise and fall in unison. Rural individuals also have to travel further to access healthcare, and the number of practitioners is sparse in comparison to metropolitan areas. Cultural and behavioral risks such as smoking, as well as the aforementioned shortage of healthcare professionals working in rural communities, contribute to disparities in both outcomes and access. One consequence of these disparities is that, in the United States, individuals living in rural areas also have life expectancies that are roughly two years shorter than their urban peers.1 Governmental and non-profit organizations have each instituted programs aimed at mitigating these disparities, but the gaps continue to widen. Programs like Mental Health First Aid can offer resources to the public that will help them bridge the gaps that rural people face in accessing quality, affordable healthcare.

Health disparities are differences in health status when compared to the population overall, often characterized by indicators such as higher incidence of disease and/or disability, higher mortality rates, lower life expectancies, and higher rates of chronic pain. Rural risk factors for health disparities include geographic isolation, lower socioeconomic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited access to healthcare specialists and subspecialists, and limited job opportunities. Rural residents are also less likely to have employer-provided health insurance coverage, and if they are poor, often are not covered by Medicaid. Federal and state agencies, membership organizations, and foundations are working to reduce these disparities and improve the health and overall well-being of rural Americans. Some organizations provide funding, information, and technical assistance to be used at the state, regional, and local levels, while others work with policymakers to help them understand the issues affecting population health and healthcare in rural America. Published in 2017-2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Rural Health Series examines rural mortality and preventable deaths, health-related behaviors, chronic disease, mental health services, and other topics related to rural health disparities. In addition to that series, the MMWR continues to publish reports that address rural health.

Summary+ In the United States, people living in rural areas face significant disparities in access to healthcare, quality of treatment, and the presence of chronic physical and mental ailments. Given their geographic isolation, it is relatively difficult for these individuals to seek emergency care, an issue that is exacerbated by socioeconomic gaps. These relationships flow in both directions\u2014health and wealth often rise and fall in unison. Rural individuals also have to travel further to access healthcare, and the number of practitioners is sparse in comparison to metropolitan areas. Cultural and behavioral risks such as smoking, as well as the aforementioned shortage of healthcare professionals working in rural communities, contribute to disparities in both outcomes and access. One consequence of these disparities is that, in the United States, individuals living in rural areas also have life expectancies that are roughly two years shorter than their urban peers.1 Governmental and non-profit organizations have each instituted programs aimed at mitigating these disparities, but the gaps continue to widen. Programs like Mental Health First Aid can offer resources to the public that will help them bridge the gaps that rural people face in accessing quality, affordable healthcare.

Cultural exchange programs provide an incredible opportunity for young people to experience different cultures, meet new people, and expand their horizons. These programs offer incredible benefits, from improved language skills to increased cultural competency. They are some debate on how significant these exposures are for our youth in terms of development; we\u2019ll look at the five significant impacts of cultural exchange programs on youth development. 1) Improved Language Skills: One of the most apparent benefits of cultural exchange programs is the improvement of language skills. When immersed in a culture of a different language, they are forced to adapt and communicate in new ways. This can lead to significant improvement in language skills, which can be incredibly valuable personally and professionally. By learning new languages, young people gain a greater understanding of other cultures and are better equipped to communicate with people worldwide. 2) Increased Cultural Competency: Besides improved language skills, cultural exchange programs can help develop increased cultural competency.

The 5 Impacts of Cultural Exchange Programs on Youth Development Leticia Nortey In today\u2019s globalized world, cross-cultural exchange is more important than ever. Cultural exchange programs provide an incredible opportunity for young people to experience different cultures, meet new people, and expand their horizons. These programs offer incredible benefits, from improved language skills to increased cultural competency. They are some debate on how significant these exposures are for our youth in terms of development; we\u2019ll look at the five significant impacts of cultural exchange programs on youth development. 1) Improved Language Skills: One of the most apparent benefits of cultural exchange programs is the improvement of language skills. When immersed in a culture of a different language, they are forced to adapt and communicate in new ways. This can lead to significant improvement in language skills, which can be incredibly valuable personally and professionally. By learning new languages, young people gain a greater understanding of other cultures and are better equipped to communicate with people worldwide. 2) Increased Cultural Competency: Besides improved language skills, cultural exchange programs can help develop increased cultural competency. This means that young people are better equipped to interact with people from different backgrounds, understand differing cultural norms, and be more acce",

Drawing on reflections and input from hundreds of program alumni across the United States, this study documents powerful effects on participants, including lasting engagement with arts and culture, significant personal and professional development, and increased leadership skills and civic engagement. About the Study Room to Rise is the result of a multi-year collaboration between the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, with support from a National Leadership Grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services. Each of the participating museums is home to a nationally recognized teen program that has operated continuously since the 1990s. These programs bring highly diverse urban youth together to work collaboratively with museum staff and artists, developing vibrant activities and events to engage teen audiences, from tours and exhibitions to performances and fashion shows. Lead Research Advisor Mary Ellen Munley and a network of critical friends and expert advisors guided this practitioner-driven research, which incorporates innovative arts-based methods. The study offers a detailed look at the lasting impact of these programs, and highlights key engagement strategies for educators. Read the Full Report Project Findings Program participants reported that their experiences as teens in museums were transformational, shaping their adult lives in significant ways. This study traces a relationship between high impact engagement strategies, short-term outcomes, and long-lasting impacts for alumni, including: Project Methods The project team documented its process carefully in this supplement to Room to Rise, which presents detailed descriptions of study design decisions, instrument developmen",

A visit to a museum can offer much more than just a simple field trip. With the support of the Smithsonian\u2019s museum educators and positive youth development organizations 4-H and Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Smithsonian exhibitions can ignite a sense of curiosity, encourage critical thinking, promote empathy and communication skills, and inspire creativity within young minds. This can be especially important for rural or urban youth who may not have easy access to museums in their home communities. Museum visits can lead to the development of lifelong learners who are eager to explore the world around them. Igniting Curiosity and Fostering Critical Thinking The Smithsonian is full of fascinating exhibits that can inspire curiosity in young visitors. From ancient artifacts to scientific wonders and historical narratives, each display has the potential to stimulate a youth's imagination. Smithsonian museum visits provide opportunities for youth learners to engage in critical thinking and problem-solving activities. Smithsonian educators design learning experiences to provoke thought, encourage youth to analyze information, draw connections, and make sense of complex concepts. By encouraging youth to ponder historical events, scientific phenomena, or artistic expressions, Smithsonian museums help develop analytical skills extending far beyond a visit. Over the summer, the National 4-H Council and Boys & Girls Clubs of America collaborated with Smithsonian educators to spark learning with over 1,100 participants from the organizations visi",

Thus, it\u2019s paramount to delve into a thorough comparison, dissecting the pros and cons of studying in a big city versus a small town. Profound Experiences in Big City Education Accessibility and Diversity Choosing a big city as a study destination invariably provides accessibility and diversity in numerous aspects. Large cities act as hubs, offering a plethora of universities and colleges, which naturally spawns a vast array of course options and fields of study. Students get the opportunity to mingle with a diversified crowd, gaining insights into various cultures and perspectives, which is pivotal for holistic development.

Deloitte's 2023 survey reveals the cost of living as the primary concern for Gen Z and millennials across 44 nations, directly challenging the idea of enhanced financial stability outside urban centers.  The high costs in major cities, exacerbated by factors like the housing crisis, significantly impact young professionals' ability to afford basic necessities, let alone engage in costly networking activities essential for career advancement.  Furthermore, while smaller towns may offer lower housing costs, they often lack access to specialized healthcare, a critical factor for long-term physical and mental well-being, as detailed by the GAO's 2023 report on rural healthcare access. This report highlights the scarcity of specialized services and the increased travel distances required for care, potentially negating any perceived benefits of lower living costs.  Therefore, the claim of superior well-being outside cities oversimplifies a complex reality with varying advantages and disadvantages depending on individual circumstances and priorities.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: Stronger social ties in smaller communities contribute to better mental and physical health for young people.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_20', 'query': 'Challenges faced by young adults in accessing specialized healthcare in rural communities', 'title': 'Health Care Capsule: Accessing Health Care in Rural America', 'url': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106651'}]\n**Short Argument**: Access to healthcare, particularly specialized care, is significantly limited in rural communities due to provider shortages and distance barriers ('4_20'). This restricts young people's ability to address health issues effectively, directly contradicting the claim that stronger social ties automatically translate to better health in smaller communities.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: Big cities offer unparalleled networking opportunities crucial for young professionals' career advancement.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_1', 'query': 'Benefits of networking for young professionals in large cities', 'title': 'The Power of Networking: How Young Professionals Can Build ... - Medium', 'url': 'https://medium.com/@floracuzzy/the-power-of-networking-how-young-professionals-can-build-meaningful-connections-d0d0f2ae8a1b'}, {'id': '0_10', 'query': 'Networking opportunities available in large cities for young professionals', 'title': 'Young Professional Networking groups - Meetup', 'url': 'https://www.meetup.com/topics/young-professional-networking/us/'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Large cities are hubs for diverse industries and networking events crucial for career advancement. Studies show 85% of jobs are filled through networking, highlighting the importance of in-person connections fostered in major metropolitan areas.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Cultural institutions like museums, theaters, and music venues in big cities offer unique enrichment and personal development opportunities for young people.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_2', 'query': 'Benefits of cultural institutions for young people', 'title': 'The 5 Impacts of Cultural Exchange Programs on Youth Development - LinkedIn', 'url': 'https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/5-impacts-cultural-exchange-programs-youth-leticia-nortey'}, {'id': '3_7', 'query': 'Impact of museums on youth development', 'title': 'The Lasting Impact of Intensive - Whitney Museum', 'url': 'https://whitney.org/education/teens/room-to-rise'}, {'id': '3_30', 'query': 'Personal development opportunities offered by museums for youth', 'title': 'Fostering Positive Youth Development at the Smithsonian through ...', 'url': 'https://www.smithsonianmag.com/blogs/smithsonian-education/2023/08/22/fostering-positive-youth-development-at-the-smithsonian-through-national-collaborations/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The \"Room to Rise\" study (\"3_7\") demonstrates the lasting impact of intensive teen programs in art museums, highlighting significant personal and professional development, increased leadership skills, and civic engagement among participants. These programs offer sustained relationships with artists and museum staff, fostering a supportive community.  While smaller communities may offer social ties, large cities provide unique access to diverse cultural institutions and experiences, fostering cultural competency (\"3_2\") and critical thinking (\"3_30\") crucial for personal growth.  The concentration of opportunities in urban areas makes consistent, enriching engagement more accessible, ultimately contributing to well-rounded development for young people.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Big cities provide greater access to specialized healthcare services, catering to the specific needs of young adults.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_0', 'query': 'Access to specialized healthcare for young adults in major cities vs. rural areas', 'title': 'Access to specialty healthcare in urban versus rural US ... - PubMed', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31852493/'}, {'id': '4_20', 'query': 'Challenges faced by young adults in accessing specialized healthcare in rural communities', 'title': 'Health Care Capsule: Accessing Health Care in Rural America', 'url': 'https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-23-106651'}]\n**Short Argument**: Studies show that access to specialized healthcare is significantly greater in urban areas compared to rural areas.  Higher population density in cities supports a wider range of specialized medical providers and services, directly benefiting young adults with specific healthcare needs.\n\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else. \n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, colleagues, fellow debaters, let\u2019s talk about something that hits close to home for many of us: where we choose to live and build our lives.  Our opponents have painted a charming picture of small-town life, but I\u2019m here to tell you that this picture misses some crucial details, especially for young people like us trying to navigate today\u2019s world.\n\nThey talk about financial stability being easier to achieve outside big cities.  But let\u2019s be real, how many of you have worried about making ends meet, about affording rent, groceries, or even just a night out?  This isn\u2019t just a personal worry; it\u2019s a global one.  Deloitte\u2019s 2023 survey of young people across 44 countries found that the *number one* concern for Gen Z and millennials is the cost of living [1].  Sure, rent might be lower in smaller towns, but what good is that if jobs are scarce and salaries are significantly lower?  It\u2019s like trading one financial challenge for another.  And what about healthcare?  We all want to be healthy, and access to good healthcare is a big part of that.  The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, pointed out in 2023 that access to specialized healthcare, the kind you might need for a serious illness or a specific condition, is much harder to come by in rural areas [2].  This isn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it\u2019s a real barrier to well-being.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about mental health.  Our opponents emphasize the strong social ties in smaller communities, and yes, those connections are important.  But they\u2019re only part of the picture.  What happens when you need professional help?  Again, the GAO report highlights the difficulties young people in rural areas face accessing mental health services [2].  Big cities, with their diverse range of mental health professionals and facilities, offer a safety net that\u2019s often missing in smaller towns.  Having a supportive community is great, but it\u2019s not a substitute for professional care when you need it.\n\nThey also praise the vibrant cultural scenes in smaller towns.  But think about it: how many world-class museums, theaters, and music venues are within easy reach in a small town versus a big city?  The \"Room to Rise\" study showed how transformative intensive arts programs can be for teenagers, leading to significant personal and professional growth [5].  These opportunities are simply more abundant in cities.  While small towns have their own charm, big cities offer a richer, more diverse cultural landscape that can broaden your horizons in ways a small town simply can\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about remote work.  Yes, it offers flexibility, but it doesn\u2019t replace the power of face-to-face connections.  We\u2019ve all heard the saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d  Well, studies show that a whopping 85% of jobs are filled through networking [3].  Big cities are hubs for industry events, conferences, and those chance encounters that can lead to your next big break.  These opportunities are simply harder to come by in smaller, less connected communities.\n\nFinally, our opponents talk about overall well-being.  We agree that\u2019s the ultimate goal.  But well-being isn\u2019t just about mental and physical health; it\u2019s about financial security, personal growth, and having the opportunity to reach your full potential.  Big cities, with their diverse industries, advanced healthcare systems, and rich cultural scenes, offer a more complete package.  They provide the resources and opportunities for young people to thrive in all aspects of their lives.  Returning to, or staying in, a big city isn\u2019t just about climbing the career ladder; it\u2019s about building a fulfilling life, a life filled with opportunities, resources, and experiences that empower you to become the best version of yourself.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1.

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate revolves around whether escaping big cities is the way out for young people, a \"way out\" defined as achieving overall well-being. We believe it unequivocally is.\n\nThe negative team focused on career advancement, but a fulfilling life requires more than a high salary. While they argued that big cities offer better job prospects, they overlooked the transformative rise of remote work.  This allows young people to earn competitive salaries while enjoying the significantly lower living costs of smaller towns.  Programs like Corsicana, Texas's remote worker incentive, offering $10,000 grants, demonstrate the proactive efforts of smaller communities to attract talent and boost local economies. This directly addresses financial stability, a cornerstone of well-being, by showing that escaping big cities doesn't mean sacrificing career prospects.  It means maximizing your earnings by minimizing your expenses.\n\nThe opponents raised concerns about healthcare access in smaller towns.  While access to specialized care can be a challenge, small-town living fosters preventative health through reduced stress, increased access to nature, and healthier lifestyles, potentially lessening the *need* for specialized care. Moreover, telehealth is rapidly bridging the gap in access to specialists, further mitigating this concern.\n\nRegarding cultural experiences, while big cities offer a concentration of options, they come at a steep price. Smaller towns offer unique cultural experiences deeply connected to the community, and at a fraction of the cost.  This affordability allows young people to engage with the arts and local events without straining their finances, further enhancing their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, the negative highlighted the importance of networking.  While in-person connections are valuable, they overstated their importance in the digital age.  Online platforms and targeted strategies allow remote workers to build robust professional networks, irrespective of location.  Moreover, the quality of connections fostered within tight-knit small-town communities often surpasses the superficial interactions of large-scale networking events in big cities.\n\nEscaping big cities represents a conscious choice to prioritize genuine connection and holistic well-being.  It\u2019s about choosing a life rich in community, nature, and deeper relationships, a life where financial security, health, and personal growth are valued over a purely career-driven existence.

In past years, entrepreneurs and potential startups were drawn to Silicon Valley, the place where Google, Apple, and Facebook all found their footing before growing at a rapid pace and developing satellite campuses across the globe. The formula for success has been a crucial mixture of venture capital, strong networks, and enough energetic talent to fuel a potential record-breaking organization. Other startup saturated cities outside of Silicon Valley included large metropolitan areas like New York City and Boston, which also could boast a similar mixture.\u00a0 The future of entrepreneurship has also evolved, in part thanks to the 2020 global pandemic where remote work is looking to become a permanent opportunity for companies of all sizes. That being the case,\u00a0recent studies\u00a0have found that entrepreneurs are more spread out across the United States, and those numbers continue to grow in certain metro areas.\u00a0 The magic formula, however, might be changing with the pandemic and is giving cities with access to relatively inexpensive but high-quality talent combined with reasonable cost of living are the new recipe for startup success. As other metro areas like Austin and Denver have seen an increase in expenses due to their popular nature, entrepreneurs and new small business owners are considering some new cost-effective options.

While all of those things take a lot of research, planning, and work in general, location may be the most important aspect to get right\u2014after all, setting up shop in the wrong city (and then having to move) would be pricey and a total waste of time and opportunity. Perhaps you\u2019re currently a business owner and recently had the realization that you\u2019re in the wrong place for what you\u2019re trying to accomplish, or maybe you\u2019re about to start a business, but you\u2019re not sure how to find the right place and start there on the right foot. Either way, you\u2019re in the right place. Today, I\u2019m going to give you an overview of each of the top 10 cities for entrepreneurship in the US (based on a report from business.org), what their small business scene is like, and a list of resources that you can utilize in each city to ensure the best success for your business. After reading this article, you\u00a0should be able to confidently determine which city you and your business \u201cbelong\u201d in and ensure that you make a smart move\u2014and not a risky one.

Did you know that there are over 550,000 new startups popping up every month? There are reasons for this, and more Americans each year are taking the entrepreneurship route because of them. Unlike in the past, today\u2019s entrepreneurs find it easier to build partnerships and find trusted advisers, they have lower taxes and relative ease of establishing a business, investment communities are incredibly popular and accessible, and they have access to a vast domestic market here at home.

We are witnessing a proliferation of apps and digital tools that promise to make our cities \u2018smart\u2019 by embedding technology into existing infrastructural networks and living units. Critics are voicing their concerns over the idea of cramming huge amounts of technology into every city intersection and alleyway, stating that the one-solution-fits-all approach practiced by most tech startups is not the best way of creating sustainable, smart urban environments. Most tech startups are currently affecting urban environments without substantially effecting the most significant urban problems such as affordable housing, education and efficient public transport. It seems this is about to change, thanks to several startup hubs, incubators and accelerators that actively target urban issues by supporting young enterprises focused on urbanism. #1 Alphabet Alphabet, a parent company of Google, is looking to get into the field of urbanism by their company, Sidewalk Labs.

SelectUSA often works with foreign-owned startups wanting to enter the U.S. market through participation in an accelerator program. While there are different datasets that attempt to track the locations of startups and accelerators, the rapid cycle of startups makes this an ever-changing landscape that accelerators both respond to and promote. This report uses quantitative and qualitative analysis to examine the current accelerator landscape in the United States. For the purpose of this analysis, accelerators are differentiated from incubators and other soft-landing programs if they operate in short-term cohorts; provide financial support through investment; select companies through a competitive process on a cyclical basis; provide educational seminars; offer intense mentorship opportunities; and deliver these services at a specific location. The analysis also considers additional data on other organizations that support startups, as well as a broad picture of the current startup landscape in the United States. The goal of this research brief is to both analyze the current accelerator landscape and examine how it can continue to complement other support organizations to meet the needs of future startups.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, more than 420,000 startups accounted for 2.2 million new jobs in 2018.Unfortunately, entrepreneurship in the U.S. has been declining for decades. In the late 1970s, the startup formation rate in the U.S.\u2014defined as the number of new firms in a given year divided by the total number of firms\u2014was nearly 14%. Four decades later, the rate was just above 8%.One of the major factors contributing to this trend is firm concentration. In recent decades, many sectors have shown a trend toward consolidation and greater concentration in the market, making large firms even larger and more successful through economies of scale, network effects, and other incumbent advantages.Economic downturns also tend to slow startup formation, and the Great Recession\u2019s effects on new business creation have proven to be especially stifling over the last decade. Unlike in past recessions, when a dip in startup activity has been followed by a period of growth, the overall startup formation rate fell in the wake of the Great Recession and has more or less remained flat at around 8% since. With less economic security due to a long, uncertain recovery, many potential entrepreneurs chose to minimize their risk and forgo new business opportunities. This is especially true of many would-be founders now in their late 20s and 30s, who graduated in a poor job market with large debt burdens.This past year, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought even more economic hardship, and the unique circumstances of this downturn have created an even more complicated picture. In addition to the typical barriers to entrepreneurship that a recession creates, different industries face divergent fortunes in the era of shutdowns and social distancing.

There are currently more than 70,000 startups in the United States, meaning there are hundreds of thousands of committed startup founders looking to grow their businesses. Many startup leaders gravitate to incubators, accelerators, and tech hubs to help fill any knowledge gaps for founders and to get better access to what startups need to grow: customers, capital, and talent. But finding the right support can be tricky, especially if it\u2019s your first time. Incubators, accelerators, and tech hubs are related but distinct entities that provide different sorts of assistance to founders. Here\u2019s a breakdown of each and what you need to know before applying to one. The 3 Types of Organized Community Support for Founders \u00a0 Incubators Help Startup Leaders Lay the Groundwork Generally, incubators are for early-stage startups that: An incubator\u2019s educational structure ultimately helps startup leaders determine the viability of their concepts. If a founder discovers their concept doesn\u2019t have a market fit, an incubator can either help them reframe their offering or save them from investing years into an idea that doesn\u2019t have long-term potential. Conversely, incubators can also affirm a startup\u2019s mission, springboarding it into its next stage of development, whether that involves securing investments and/or building a repeatable sales process. Fitting within these parameters is important because most incubator programs focus on walking startup leaders through market strategy and business model canvases. If you haven\u2019t verified your market fit with customers and aren\u2019t actively selling a proof of concept yet, an incubator program could help you position and grow your budding startup. Another component of incubator programs is networking. Incubators connect you with subject matter experts, instructors, mentors, investors, and fellow founders. This wide range of connections ro",

Advertisement Global Innovation Hubs Index 2020 Produced by Credit: LOFT1994/SHUTTERSTOCK Executive summary Global innovation hubs are defined as cities or metropolitan areas that can lead the flow of global innovation elements and influence the efficiency of resource allocation, drawing on their unique advantages in science and technology innovation. In technological and industrial competitions, they emerge as global cities that integrate research innovation, an innovation economy and a supportive ecosystem for innovation. The global community faces common challenges. Climate change, ecological degradation, infectious diseases and potential risks brought by emerging technologies have challenged the stability of human development. The solution lies in significant breakthroughs and a paradigm shift in science. The fourth industrial revolution, triggered by the development of digital technologies, requires more efficient innovation models. Moreover, the nature of innovation-driven development demands updating, cultivating and reshaping the innovation ecosystem. In meeting these needs, global science and technology innovation hubs play a vital role; they continually produce new knowledge and ideas, drive economic development, and facilitate the evolution of the innovation ecosystem. A worldwide assessment of these global innovation hubs is, therefore, of great relevance.

Perhaps compete in a startup competition for some free money? \ud83d\ude09 Most accelerators have started to search for niches and verticalize in order to focus more on facilitating partnerships. If you\u2019re a B2B company in an industry with long sales cycles, high barriers to entry, or large incumbents that your want to work with, it can certainly be worth giving up equity to join these more specialized programs if they fit with your strategy. That being said, keep a lookout for equity-free incubators, launchpads, and accelerator programs (often run by corporates to find startups to partner with). They often have free office space, hosting credits, and other resources at their disposal that can help you extend your runway. Not sure which to apply to?

Identifying Scaling Success Factors A lot of academic and scaleup institute research has been done on factors leading to the production of scaleups, but this research is rarely global and has often mixed traditional small or young firms with tech startups, which are a different species and should be examined in their own right. Further, existing research is often based on interviews of scaleup executives, asking what they are focused on currently to try to infer what similar companies should be doing. This is a clunky and misleading effort at best because a one-year-old startup should focus on different issues than, for instance, a successful and large seven-year-old scaleup. Grouping all young companies together is a fundamentally flawed approach. In this report, we present the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first longitudinal research into scaleup success factors, building on the central question of what behaviors, resources, and characteristics of startups differentiate those that within four to eight years scaled to $50 million and higher valuations from those startups that didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t. For the purpose of this analysis we looked at startups that were less than four years old at the time of their leaders taking the survey (from 2015 to 2019).

As a young entrepreneur, making your mark in a competitive industry can be a daunting task. There's a unique set of challenges that come with launching and scaling a business at a young age. My own journey of founding an agency at age 18 required a blend of innovative strategies, relentless perseverance and a deep understanding of the digital landscape. In this article, I'm going to share some of the top challenges that I faced while starting my business and how you can overcome them. I hope these reflections serve as a guide for other young entrepreneurs aiming to carve out their own success stories in the business world. 1. Overcoming Client Skepticism And Perceived Inexperience When I started my agency, I faced the challenge of convincing older, more experienced clients in a competitive market. I overcame skepticism by combining professionalism, my specialized knowledge and the successful outcomes of my early clients to build a solid reputation. Establishing trust and credibility is crucial in business, especially when you don't have a substantial track record. I found that leveraging my industry-specific knowledge was key to gaining the trust of older real estate agents. You can do this by sharing your insights during conversations to help bridge the age gap. After securing initial clients, showcasing their success stories is essential. These case studies are powerful in attracting new clients, serving as concrete evidence of your business's effectiveness. 2. Selling Services Online In the beginning, my agency targeted U.S. and Canadian real estate companies while being based in the United Kingdom. Convincing clients through online meetings posed a challenge. Effective strategies to help sell services online include using case studies and comparable examples of your previous clients as proof of your success potential.

Both external and internal pressures can wear down on you, and before long, you can start feeling overwhelmed. But these pressures shouldn\u2019t deter you from becoming an entrepreneur, and there are steps you can take to overcome them. Here, eight leaders from Young Entrepreneur Council discuss some of those common obstacles young business owners face and offer their best advice based on their own experiences as young entrepreneurs. Young Entrepreneur Council members share common challenges for young entrepreneurs. 1. Trying To Do Everything Themselves Many new entrepreneurs feel the need to do everything themselves. In doing so, they take on more than they should and scatter their attention. My advice is to hire professionals for tasks that you're not an expert in. Instead of trying to build products from scratch, see if you can partner up with other people or buy a product instead. Don't reinvent the wheel, know where your strengths lie and then stick to what you know. - Syed Balkhi, WPBeginner 2. Too Much Focus On The Big Picture Nothing is instant. It is about perseverance and believing in what you do. Often, when starting out, it is easy to focus on the long-term goal and big picture until you have tons of short-term advice and realities staring you in the face. My advice to entrepreneurs is to focus on the small wins. Small wins lead to bigger wins. Companies are successful because of long strings of small wins and long strings of good, small decisions. - Ryan Stoner, Dendro 3. A Lack Of Confidence Lack of confidence due to inexperience, or self-perceived inexperience, is a common obstacle that I believe young entrepreneurs face.

As traditional industries face unprecedented challenges and markets continue to shift, innovative startups are becoming key drivers of economic dynamism. They introduce fresh ideas, develop new technologies, and disrupt existing markets, ultimately creating jobs and stimulating local economies. Recognizing this critical role, our proposal outlines the establishment of Startup Incubation Hubs that are specifically designed to support local entrepreneurs. These hubs will serve as centralized locations where budding business owners can access vital resources, industry expertise, and essential mentorship, empowering them to turn their innovative ideas into successful enterprises. By creating a nurturing environment for startups, we aim to stimulate innovation, enhance local economic development, and build a sustainable ecosystem for emerging businesses. The incubation hubs will not only provide physical space and resources but also foster a community of like-minded individuals who can collaborate and learn from each other. Through tailored programs that include workshops, networking events, and mentorship opportunities, we will cultivate an atmosphere of continuous learning and growth. This collaborative ecosystem will not only help startups thrive but also encourage established businesses to engage with and invest in the next generation of innovators. Ultimately, by investing in these hubs, we are laying the foundation for a resilient economy that can adapt to future challenges while promoting creativity, collaboration, and sustainable growth in our community.

By understanding the nuances of each funding type, you can make more informed decisions that align with your startup\u2019s vision and growth strategy. Angel Investors Angel investors are affluent individuals who provide capital for startups, often in exchange for ownership equity or convertible debt. These investors are typically well-connected and experienced in the business world, offering not just financial support but also valuable mentorship and industry connections. Their involvement can be pivotal during the early stages of a startup, when access to capital is limited and the need for guidance is high. Advantages of Angel Investors One of the primary advantages of receiving funding from angel investors is the flexibility they offer.

Additionally, angel investors bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table, providing strategic advice that can help navigate the complexities of early-stage growth.

These funds have a rich history, dating back to the post-World War II era, when the US government launched initiatives to promote scientific research and development. Over the years, grant programs have evolved to cater to diverse industries and sectors, including technology, healthcare, and renewable energy. Despite their benefits, government grants are often shrouded in myths. One common misconception is that grants are only available for non-profit organizations or academic institutions. However, many grant programs are designed specifically for for-profit startups and small businesses. Another myth is that grants are easy to secure, requiring minimal effort and paperwork. In reality, the application process can be complex and competitive, necessitating thorough research, careful planning, and meticulous documentation. Understanding the grant history and debunking funding myths are vital for entrepreneurs seeking to leverage these valuable resources effectively.

New business applications increased dramatically in the second half of 2020 to levels never observed in the data and have remained substan-tially above pre-pandemic levels through September 2022 (Haltiwanger, 2021; U.S. Census Bureau, 2022).

Urban areas differ in the extent to which they have a diverse set of industries or, conversely, the degree to which they are very specialized in a particular industry. Richmond Fed analysis supports previous research findings on the extent to which diversification or specialization varies with the employment size of urban areas.

Even in good economic times, young people experience unemployment rates that are 3\u20134 times higher than adults. More than three out of four of the world\u2019s young workers have informal jobs, while young people are overrepresented in working poverty and less protected forms of work, such as temporary and gig employment. During economic crises, the situation for young people in the labour market deteriorates much faster than for adults and persists for longer periods. The scarring effects for youth were clear after the global financial crisis\u00a0(GFC) of 2008\u201309. Beyond these negative trends, it is important to recognise where countries have done much better in getting young people into decent and productive employment, including in the wake of crises. The success of European countries in tackling youth unemployment and inactivity has led to many attempts to replicate the policy approach, which involves integrated programmes such as the EU Youth Guarantee. However, there are major constraints to applying such an approach in developing countries and emerging economies. Against this background, the paper reviews the longer run trends in youth employment, along with the impact of crises on young people, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic, in both advanced and developing countries. Next, it explores the lessons learned on how best to deal with youth employment challenges drawing from recent global meta-analyses. While the paper highlights that not all lessons can be extrapolated, it is important that countries develop integrated youth employment strategies that address job creation, quality of jobs, and inclusion.

The case studies cover a broad range of initiatives designed to improve young people\u2019s employment outcomes, from educational attainment and vocational pathways to reengagement activities. The section firstly looks at the benefits of collaboration before going on to set out five key elements of successful partnership working for youth employment: Benefits of collaboration There has long been a strong consensus that partnership working is important: \u201ccollaborations are not easy. It\u2019s much easier to do what you want to do in your own bubble. But that limits the opportunities available to young people.\u201d39\u00a0Critically, within current economic and fiscal contexts, partnership working allows individual organisations to achieve better outcomes in a more effective and efficient way \u2013 or in other words to \u201cdo more with less\u201d.39 It allows partners to collectively address challenges in a more strategic way, reducing duplication, plugging gaps in the system and making more targeted interventions. The issues faced by young people are far too complex for any one organisation to tackle alone. Young people in particular often require of combination of education and training support, as well as employment support. Wraparound support that addresses wider barriers often needs to be in place as well. This may be provided through one-stop-shop centres: YO!

Recent trends indicate a sustained increase in the vocational psychology and career development literature pertaining to diversity issues since the early 1990s. These shifts have been fueled in part by the changing demographic patterns in society and the increasing numbers of women and individuals from diverse racial and ethnic groups comprising the labor force. As the face of the labor force has changed over time, concerns regarding how the field has (a) understood and defined the career development process, (b) conducted vocational research, and (c) trained career counseling professionals for helping a broad range of individuals have been addressed. Today, diversity issues are considered to be crucial in understanding an individual\u2019s career development and decision-making process, and diversity issues have become a major focus within the field. As the U.S. population continues to grow increasingly diverse, career counseling professionals will need to be more responsive to the needs of this changing population. When addressing issues of diversity, it is important to note that these discussions should not be limited to race and ethnicity. Career counseling professionals also need to be attuned to the influence of gender, sexual orientation, ability status, socioeconomic status, and other societal and structural factors that influence career development in a variety of ways. Diversity Issues As social beings, the environments within which people live and learn have an enormous impact on career development. The opportunities afforded to individuals, the resources at their disposal, and the social framework within which people live all interact and contribute to their sense of self and their awareness and knowledge of various career options.

Russell and Kali Van Campen University of Arizona Abstract: As we commemorate 100 years of youth development programs whose origins are traced to organizations founded in the United States, we consider key insights as well as strategies relevant for diversity and inclusion. Many of the large, mainstream youth development organizations and programs that were founded over a century ago now primarily serve youth in the \u201cmainstream\u201d: youth from the middle classes, traditional families, and dominant cultural groups. A growing body of scholarship considers the positive development of youth who are marginalized due to their social class, ability, sexuality, citizenship status, race, ethnicity, or culture. We draw insights from studies of youth and families who are immigrants, or who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT). These findings provide a vantage point for considering ways that contemporary youth development organizations might stretch the margins, or adapt their practices, in order to reach and include all youth. Introduction As we commemorate 100 years of youth development programs and practices whose origins are traced largely to organizations founded in the United States, we observe several contradictions or tensions in the field. There have been profound changes in the daily lives of youth and adolescents during the last century\u2014demographic, social, economic, political, and technological\u2014that have resulted in a youth population that is increasingly diverse in personal and family characteristics as well as life experiences.

Many people have debated whether it is better to live in a big city or a small town. Both options have their pros and cons, and ultimately, it comes down to personal preference. Here are some factors to consider when choosing where to live: 1. What are the job opportunities like in big cities and small towns? Big cities typically have more robust, high-end, and sophisticated job opportunities such as in IT, Financial Technology, and innovative start-ups. Smaller towns, on the other hand, are better places for smaller enterprises, skilled trades, and other less-competitive industries. 2. Are the schools and universities better in big cities or small towns? Big cities also usually have better schools and universities than small towns. This gives people a better chance at higher and more rounded education, which can prepare them for the workplace. Large cities have more opportunities, especially when it comes to academics. 3. Is it safer to live in a big city or a small town? It depends, but statistically, no. Many cities have far more violent crime than small towns in pure numbers simply because there are more people in cities than in rural areas. However, statistically, there is more violent crime per capita in rural areas than in cities. 4. What are the cultural and recreational opportunities in big cities? When it comes to cultural and recreational opportunities, big cities have a lot to offer. You never have a shortage of things to see and do when you move to a major metro area. Regardless of your preferences, you\u2019ll find places that appeal to your interests, filled with like-minded people who share them. Whether you\u2019re into loud clubs or quiet bookstores, you\u2019ll find both in abundance. 5. What size city is best to live in?

To save a bus ticket, Emmanuel sometimes puts one daughter in the other\u2019s lap.

You can find specialized workshops, training programs, and educational institutions that offer courses and certifications to enhance your skills and advance your career. 4.

So, the top priorities of our agenda, could be the following: Upcoming Changes: In the realm of technology, 2024 promises further integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) into our daily lives. From smart homes that predict our needs to AI-driven public transport systems, a more interconnected world awaits. Challenges: However, with enhanced connectivity comes the challenge of privacy. Cybersecurity threats are a looming concern, demanding rigorous regulations and infrastructural investment. Upcoming Changes: The fight against climate change will usher in more sustainable energy solutions. Electric vehicles, renewable energy production, and sustainable agriculture will likely gain more traction in 2024. Challenges: The immediate challenge is to balance economic growth with environmental conservation. Implementing green technologies, while lucrative in the long run, demands heavy initial investments and a shift from traditional industries. Upcoming Changes: Societies worldwide are becoming more inclusive, with a strong focus on equity and justice. The year 2024 might witness more countries adopting policies that are inclusive of diverse racial, ethnic, gender, and sexual identities. Challenges: This inclusivity, however, may be met with resistance from conservative factions. Navigating this dichotomy requires strong leadership and educational campaigns.

The following has been edited for length and clarity. As a career and success coach who predominantly works with millennials and Gen Zers, I help people create careers that don't make them dread Monday morning. I worked in sales in the adtech industry for about 10 years and had a successful career on paper, but I felt disconnected from what I was doing. Through much trial, error, and reflection, I learned that it wasn't what I wanted to do long term, so I transitioned in 2019. My primary focus is helping my clients set goals. From there, we work on strategies to determine the right career path for them, then execute and land the job. Right now, it's an employer's market, so I'm helping job seekers navigate a tough environment. Many are still making career pivots regardless. These are some trends we'll see for job seekers this year. Layoffs will continue While I don't think we'll see layoffs in the same volume we did in 2023, it's still a much-tougher market than we saw in the few years during and after the COVID-19 emergency, as well as in the \"Great Resignation.\" We'll most likely see more this year. Tech, in particular, experienced many layoffs in 2023, and I think we'll see that continue in 2024. Artificial intelligence might drive some layoffs, but it's also an incredibly helpful tool. Employers are using AI, so employees should be as well. Everyone should consider implementing it in their job search, whether automating job applications or helping with r\u00e9sum\u00e9 optimization and customization.

Therefore, networking is a critical skill for any young professional looking to make big career moves. Although it\u2019s a nice benefit, networking won\u2019t just land you jobs. There are many more benefits to professional networking than most young adults realize. 1. People Notice You When you invest the time in establishing connections with people in your industry or community, it shows. People recognize you based on events you\u2019ve attended or mutual connections you share. The more people notice you, the more likely you will end up in the \u201cin crowd\u201d with established colleagues and peers. This same principle applies to virtual networking as well. Sites like LinkedIn show individuals what mutual connections they share. If you apply for a job somewhere and a colleague you met at a networking event knows the hiring manager, they can view your profile or ask your shared connection about your work ethic. 2. Your Creative Intellect Improves When you network, you build lasting connections with people. You can use these connections to discuss shifts in your industry, get insight on handling a new project, or pick their brain about the best career moves you can make. Regardless of the specifics of the conversation, talking to other professionals helps you become a more forward thinker because it boosts your creative intelligence and helps you become more well-rounded. 3. You Build Self-Confidence Networking doesn\u2019t just open doors for future job opportunities, it also helps with self-improvement.

Networking events, however, remain a steadfast avenue for professionals to connect, share ideas, and build meaningful relationships. The question on many minds is: Are networking events truly worth the time and effort? Let\u2019s explore the benefits and drawbacks to help you make an informed decision. Building Genuine Connections: Networking events provide a unique opportunity to meet people in your industry, fostering genuine connections that go beyond the confines of virtual communication. Face-to-face interactions allow for a more personal touch, helping to establish trust and rapport that can be challenging to achieve through emails or online platforms. Opportunity for Collaboration: Collaborations often stem from networking events where professionals from diverse backgrounds converge. These events serve as a melting pot of ideas, offering a space for potential partnerships, joint ventures, or collaborations. The chance encounters at these events can lead to innovative projects that might not have been conceivable otherwise. Knowledge Exchange: One of the significant advantages of attending networking events is the opportunity to stay updated on industry trends and innovations. Through conversations and discussions, you can gain insights into the latest developments, emerging technologies, and best practices. This knowledge exchange can prove invaluable in keeping your skills sharp and staying competitive in your field. Career Advancement: Networking events provide a platform to showcase your skills, achievements, and aspirations.

Some estimates show in fact that 80% of jobs are filled through networking.[1] Yet, as we at inHive know all too well, young people\u2019s access to networks are highly unequal and those at the bottom of the income pyramid simply do not have the same access to \u2018social capital\u2019- whether this be their parents\u2019 connections or contacts from elite university experiences. But the barriers to effective networking can go far beyond institutional obstacles. At inHive we\u2019ve been thinking about how gender and culture can also shape young people\u2019s ability to network. One academic study has suggested that in addition to the structural exclusion, internal hesitation often serves as a greater barrier for women than men. This internal hesitation, Greguletz, Diehl and Kreutzer[2] argue boils down to two reasons; Reflecting on this research and our own experiences in the field we argue that the type of network and how individuals in the network relate to one another matters: Greguletz, Diehl and Kreutzer\u2019s research is based on a study of 37 high-profile female leaders working in large German corporations. In the corporate setting it is unsurprising that with the already high levels of gender inequality in positions of power, soft barriers such as internal hesitation is augmented. In contrast, community-based women\u2019s only alumni networks such as the CAMA network, comprising of female leaders educated through support from CAMFED, have proven to not only be incredibly impactful but also incredibly empowering for its members.

Good news: there are ways to network that suit your quiet style. This guide is full of tips and strategies to help you connect without the overwhelm. Let\u2019s start networking on your terms! Key Takeaways Understanding the Challenges for Introverts in Networking Introverts face challenges with social anxiety, feeling pressured to be outgoing, and getting drained by large social gatherings. Social anxiety It\u2019s common for a person to feel nervous or scared in big groups or when they meet someone new. This feeling is called social anxiety, and many people who like being alone deal with it at networking events. They worry about what to say and if others will like them. Their heart might beat fast and they could sweat more than usual. Good planning can make things easier at these events. Before going, think about the kind of people you\u2019ll see there and what you might talk about. Have a few questions ready to ask others. This helps make talking less scary because you\u2019re ready for it. Also, try to go step by step instead of rushing to meet everyone all at once. Pressure to be outgoing Many introverts feel like they have to act more outgoing at networking events. This comes from a false idea that only extroverted actions lead to success when meeting new people. Everywhere, in person events and business gatherings often highlight the social butterfly, making it seem like this is the only way to fit in or do well. But for an introvert, trying too hard to be someone they\u2019re not can be tiring and even scary. Instead of being loud or always ready with something to say, introverts might find networking challenging because they\u2019re forced into situations where small talk seems important. Sadly, meaningful connections get lost because of the stress on acting lively and chatty. Even so, many successful networkers are actually good listeners who know how to form relationship",

However, introverts have unique strengths that can make them exceptional networkers when approached strategically. This guide explores practical and effective networking strategies tailored for introverts, helping them turn networking into a rewarding experience. \u00a0 Embrace Your Strengths Introverts bring valuable qualities to networking situations, such as active listening, thoughtful communication, and a preference for one-on-one interactions. These strengths can be leveraged to build meaningful connections. Active listening allows introverts to understand others deeply, which fosters trust and rapport. Thoughtful communication enables them to offer considered responses and ask insightful questions, enhancing the quality of interactions. Introverts often excel in one-on-one settings where deeper, more personal conversations can take place, making these scenarios ideal for building strong relationships. \u00a0 Prepare and Plan Ahead Preparation is key to effective networking, especially for introverts. Before attending a networking event, it's essential to research the event details, such as the guest list, format, and key topics. This allows introverts to come prepared with relevant talking points and questions, reducing the anxiety of spontaneous interactions. Setting clear goals for the event\u2014whether it's meeting a specific number of people, learning about certain topics, or finding potential collaborators\u2014provides a sense of direction. Crafting and practicing a brief introduction about yourself can also ease the initial interaction with new contacts. \u00a0 Leverage Smaller Networking Opportunities While large networking events can be overwhelming, smaller, more intimate settings offer a more comfortable environment for introverts.

                      "raw_content": "Inside Communal Living: Shared Living Spaces Explode in Popularity The urban housing landscape is transforming, fueled by the growing popularity of communal living, or \"co-living.\" Affordable rents become even more relevant when considering the nationwide surge in rental costs. CoreLogic data from last month shows a 30 percent increase in single-family rents across the country since February 2020. The spike in rents is part of a broader trend where renters, especially in urban centers like Chicago, are allocating a substantial portion of their income towards housing, with the average American renter household spending about 40 percent of its income on housing costs, according to CoreLogic's data. Said to be a modern housing solution by those who invest in the growing sector, co-living blends private and shared spaces, with its value proposition being affordability, flexibility, and community. A Modern Solution to Urban Housing Challenges? Like having a traditional roommate with a twist, co-living offers residents a private bedroom within an already fully furnished home, while sharing common areas like kitchens and living rooms with others assigned to apartments. For individuals like Mark Ayers who struggled financially due to rent being up three-fold since the onset of the pandemic, co-living was an attractive option. \"[Living there] was about being part of a community while I saved up for a down payment on a house,\" Ayers told Newsweek. Complementing Ayers' perspective on the cost-effectiveness of co-living, rental data offers a broader view of the financial landscape in major U.S. cities. For example, at 'The 808 Cleveland' high-rise building in downtown Chicago, managed by co-living residential company Common, a fully-furnished room in a four-bedroom apartment starts at $1,332 for a six-month lease. Comparatively, an unfurnished private studio in the same building starts at $1,994, and a more lavish 3-bedroom, 3-bath Penthouse begins at $5,730. Similarly, in New York City's Upper Manhattan, where studio rents ",

But there is a cost: With higher housing and living costs, cities are only affordable by those able to secure the best jobs and the highest salaries. Economists would thus expect a strong self-selection for migration to cities based on ability\u2014only the most able, the argument goes, should choose to live in a big city, because they are the ones with the best chances to earn the money needed to enjoy city life. In reality, however, such a stark self-selection is not observable in the data. Gianmarco Ottaviano, professor of economics and Achille and Giulia Boroli Chair in European Studies at Bocconi, in a paper with Jorge De la Roca (University of Southern California) and Diego Puga (CEMFI), argues that self-confidence, and not necessarily ability, is the main driver of location decisions for young workers. As in a self-fulfilling prophecy, those who choose to live in a big city have more valuable learning experiences that often allow them to aspire to the best jobs and to remain in a big city. The paper was published in the Journal of the European Economic Association. Ability, on the contrary, is the main driver of relocation for senior workers, but the lasting impact of earlier choices dampens their incentives to move. Only those who wildly under-assessed their ability tend to move from a small to a big city later in life. The authors exploit the possibility to follow through life 6,111 Americans who were administered both the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79), when they",

Before we dive into our list of the best cities across the U.S. for young professionals, let's take a look at some of the factors that make a city great. We picked the cities on the list based on the following criteria: Cost of Living One of the most important factors for young professionals is the cost of living. High living costs can quickly eat into a young professional's salary, making it difficult to save money or enjoy their free time. A city with a reasonable cost of living can make all the difference in a young professional's life. Work Opportunities Another important fa",

The 5 Impacts of Cultural Exchange Programs on Youth Development Leticia Nortey In today\u2019s globalized world, cross-cultural exchange is more important than ever. Cultural exchange programs provide an incredible opportunity for young people to experience different cultures, meet new people, and expand their horizons. These programs offer incredible benefits, from improved language skills to increased cultural competency. They are some debate on how significant these exposures are for our youth in terms of development; we\u2019ll look at the five significant impacts of cultural exchange programs on youth development. 1) Improved Language Skills: One of the most apparent benefits of cultural exchange programs is the improvement of language skills. When immersed in a culture of a different language, they are forced to adapt and communicate in new ways. This can lead to significant improvement in language skills, which can be incredibly valuable personally and professionally. By learning new languages, young people gain a greater understanding of other cultures and are better equipped to communicate with people worldwide. 2) Increased Cultural Competency: Besides improved language skills, cultural exchange programs can help develop increased cultural competency. This means that young people are better equipped to interact with people from different backgrounds, understand differing cultural norms, and be more acce",

This qualitative study describes the characteristics and dimensions of teen programs in history museums. The research focuses on three award-winning programs: the Student Historians program at New-York Historical Society, the Teen Innovators program at Brooklyn Historical Society, and the Teens Make History program at the Missouri History Museum. These programs have many of the same characteristics and dimensions as teen programs at other types of museums. However, these programs intentionally incorporate the study of history and the specific nature of a history museum into their development and facilitation. Additionally, these programs appear to impact both the general youth development of the teenage participants, as well as their historical literacy. These findings can be used to facilitate conversations between history museums who already have or wish to develop programming for teenagers, as well as provide a baseline for future studies. i ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS First and foremost, I would like to thank my thesis committee chair, Dr. Kris Morrissey, for all of her guidance and support throughout my entire graduate school experience.

Drawing on reflections and input from hundreds of program alumni across the United States, this study documents powerful effects on participants, including lasting engagement with arts and culture, significant personal and professional development, and increased leadership skills and civic engagement. About the Study Room to Rise is the result of a multi-year collaboration between the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Walker Art Center, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, and The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, with support from a National Leadership Grant from the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services. Each of the participating museums is home to a nationally recognized teen program that has operated continuously since the 1990s. These programs bring highly diverse urban youth together to work collaboratively with museum staff and artists, developing vibrant activities and events to engage teen audiences, from tours and exhibitions to performances and fashion shows. Lead Research Advisor Mary Ellen Munley and a network of critical friends and expert advisors guided this practitioner-driven research, which incorporates innovative arts-based methods. The study offers a detailed look at the lasting impact of these programs, and highlights key engagement strategies for educators.

However, the benefits of involving children in theater activities, such as plays, musicals, and drama, are immeasurable. Beyond the glitz and glamour of the stage, theater offers a myriad of advantages that contribute to a child\u2019s holistic development. Let\u2019s explore the transformative impact of the spotlight on young performers and how the theater becomes a powerful stage for personal growth\u2014the benefits of theater for kids. One of the most apparent benefits of children engaging in theater is the boost in self-confidence. Standing under the spotlight, delivering lines, and expressing emotions in front of an audience cultivates a sense of self-assurance. This newfound confidence extends beyond the stage, influencing their interactions in school, social settings, and even future professional endeavors. Theater demands effective communication, both verbal and non-verbal. Through memorizing lines, projecting their voice, and understanding body language, children develop a heightened sense of communication. These skills are transferable to various aspects of their lives, aiding in academic presentations, job interviews, and fostering better relationships with peers and adults. Theater is a powerful medium for emotional expression. Engaging in dramatic roles allows children to explore a range of emotions and understand different perspectives. This emotional intelligence enhances their empathy and ability to connect with others on a deeper level. By portraying diverse characters, children learn to appreciate and navigate the complexities of human emotions, fostering a more compassionate and understanding mindset. Producing a successful theater performance requires teamwork and collaboration. Children involved in theater learn to work cohesively with a diverse group of individuals, each contributing their unique ski",

Abstract This review elaborates on the influence of music on the psychological well-being of adolescents, covering the potential advantages, drawbacks, and necessary strategic interventions associated with music exposure. Initially, we characterize music and delve into a multifaceted classification system. Music, as a pervasive art form, is categorized based on regional and national parameters, and it also distinguishes through the assorted genres and traits. The mental well-being of adolescents is significantly influenced by music through mechanisms such as the facilitation of emotional expression and regulation, fortification of social bonds and the sense of belonging, as well as the fostering of creativity and cognitive development.

Their identity is defined by heritage and traditions, culture, science, and the arts. They also constitute forums of intercultural dialogue, places where patterns and lifestyles are collectively shaped before they are disseminated to the wider world. A sustainable city has to cultivate the seeds of freedom and offer a space to all for expressing their creativity and enhancing their abilities. This chapter examines the role of intellectual and cultural resources as key assets for urban sustainability and presents a spectrum of inspiring actions to reinforce urban identity and make citizens proud of the places in which they live. Knowledge cities invest in education, and partnerships with universities and businesses provide valuable models for targeting investments towards world cities of excellence. Cities are living heritages and legacies in which citizens project their hopes and desires for a better future. The urban cultural heritage is as important for humanity as exceptional rural natural sites. Arts in the city represent the ultimate expression of collective intelligence, imagination, and ingenuity. Many innovative actions focus on the cultural enhancement of urban spaces and the artistic creation that transforms everyday environments into unique experiences.

And perhaps the most common thrust of arts advocacy is that while arts education is inherently valuable, it also sows the seeds for achievement across disciplines. \u201cEverybody wants more festivals and places for children to play and learn.\u201d A COMMITMENT TO EXPAND ARTS EDUCATION INVESTMENTS In a 2005 Harris poll, 93% of Americans agreed that the arts are vital to providing a well-rounded education for children. An analysis sponsored by the National Endowment for the Arts in 2012 revealed that teenagers and young adults of low socioeconomic status with a history of in-depth arts involvement showed significantly better academic outcomes than kids from similar backgrounds who have less arts involvement. The 2017 Social Impact of the Arts Project (SIAP) report indicated that higher cultural participation in low-income neighborhoods is a predictor of higher student performance. The conclusion is clear: arts and science education are critical for our students, and New Yorkers want more. landscape varies significantly across the city. A 2014 report by the New York City Comptroller revealed large gaps in the provision of arts instruction and a general decline in overall arts education funding for the city\u2019s 1.1 million public school students. According to the same data, schools in lower income areas of the city were disproportionately impacted by these cuts. A nuance to this research was found in a subsequent study of arts education opportunities, grades 1-4, conducted by the CUNY Graduate Center\u2019s Center for Urban Research, which revealed that no consistent, ",

The educational programs for schoolchildren provided by CIG members include: Museum tours: Guided tours to discover and explore masterpieces of art and unique cultural, historical, and scientific artifacts. Hands-on workshops in art, science, and performing arts: These programs, conducted by skilled educators, extend and personalize the tour experience. Lectures, performances, concerts, exploration tours, and seminars: These offer direct contact with living artists, performers, curators, scientists, and historians, and a personal view of the institutions they represent.

A visit to a museum can offer much more than just a simple field trip. With the support of the Smithsonian\u2019s museum educators and positive youth development organizations 4-H and Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Smithsonian exhibitions can ignite a sense of curiosity, encourage critical thinking, promote empathy and communication skills, and inspire creativity within young minds. This can be especially important for rural or urban youth who may not have easy access to museums in their home communities. Museum visits can lead to the development of lifelong learners who are eager to explore the world around them. Igniting Curiosity and Fostering Critical Thinking The Smithsonian is full of fascinating exhibits that can inspire curiosity in young visitors. From ancient artifacts to scientific wonders and historical narratives, each display has the potential to stimulate a youth's imagination. Smithsonian museum visits provide opportunities for youth learners to engage in critical thinking and problem-solving activities. Smithsonian educators design learning experiences to provoke thought, encourage youth to analyze information, draw connections, and make sense of complex concepts. By encouraging youth to ponder historical events, scientific phenomena, or artistic expressions, Smithsonian museums help develop analytical skills extending far beyond a visit.

Further, as school field trips have decreased with waning budgets and with increased focus on standardized testing, many teens may not have access to or feel welcome in museums. But there\u2019s a growing trend among museum educators to focus on teens and to develop meaningful ways to engage them in the arts and in social issues through museum collections. Now, there\u2019s evidence to demonstrate the lasting impact of such work in shaping the lives of young people, based on a study of four contemporary art museums with teen programs that have been around since the 1990s. Late in 2016, a report was published on research funded by the federal Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS). (It should be noted here that IMLS, like the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, would be eliminated under the White House\u2019s recently proposed draft federal budget blueprint.) The research report, \u201cRoom to Rise: The Lasting Impact of Intensive Teen Programs in Art Museums,\u201d reflects a multi-year collaboration among four contemporary art museums: the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston and the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles. As described on the Whitney\u2019s website: Each of the participating museums is home to a nationally recognized teen program that has operated continuously since the 1990s. These programs bring highly diverse urban youth together to work collaboratively with museum staff and artists, developing vibrant activities and events to engage teen audiences, from tours and exhibitions to performances and fashion shows. These are not one-off experiences. The programs studied go deep with relatively small cohorts of teenage participants, typically engaging teens for one to three years and serving ",

The findings here are taken from our longer report, The Impact of Arts and Cultural Engagement on Population Health: Findings from Major Cohort Studies in the UK and USA 2017 \u2013 2022, available at: www.sbbresearch.org. We encourage people to read the referenced research papers in full before using findings to develop policies or services. Headlines Children and young people who participate in arts and cultural activities: \u27a2 Display less hyperactivity and inattention, and fewer antisocial or criminal behaviours. \u27a2 Have better prosocial behaviours, such as empathy or helping others. \u27a2 Are less likely to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and use substances. Data suggest these benefits may stem from the arts\u2019 ability to support young peoples\u2019 creativity, improve their self-esteem, and support better self-control. Page 2 of 4 Background A large body of evidence exists for the role that the arts can play in supporting child development and young people\u2019s health (1). However, much of this research is small scale and has generally focused on short term effects of arts engagement. Seeking to explore longer term effects, we\u2019ve used large datasets from population cohort studies in the UK and USA. These track the health and activities of thousands of randomly sampled people over multiple years and decades, from which we can identify population-level links between arts engagement and children and young peoples\u2019 social development and healthy behaviours. Developmental and social (or antisocial) behaviours Our findings show that children who read daily for pleasure display lower levels of hyperactivity and inattention, and better prosocial behaviour, such as empathy or helping others.

Ironically, this addiction to being understood has left me feeling misunderstood.

Indeed, participation in purposeful youth museum programs can greatly enhance and foster family learning. Falk and Dierking (2010) note that 95% of a child\u2019s time learning science does not happen in school and that there are many informal learning opportunities for parents to provide their children with a sense of how the world works around them. Thus, what happens outside of school profoundly influences learning. In fact, as much as 33% of the variance in student achievement can be attributed to differences between children whose parents read to them, encourage them to go to college, and take them to the library and cultural events and children whose parents do not provide those supports (Goodwin, 2011). \u2029 As research by Weiss, Little, Bouffard, Deschenes, and Malone (2009) found, \u201cForty years of steadily accumulating research shows that out-of-school or \u2018complementary learning\u2019 opportunities are major predictors of children\u2019s development, learning and educational achievement.\u201d Even more troubling is that \u201ceconomically and otherwise disadvantaged children are less likely than their more-advantaged peers to have access to these opportunities\u201d (p. 2). \u2029 Learning in the 21st century requires students of the \u201ciGeneration\u201d to develop a set of skills needed to succeed in the workforce and to become productive citizens in our society (Rosen, 2011). These skills cannot be developed in isolation; they depend on the social learning experiences offered in institutions like museums.

Intensive programming is a great tool to offer teens in terms of education, networking, and career-building, while providing your museum new ways to connect and engage. What is intensive programming? Intensive programming, in any context, combines high-quality curriculum with experienced instruction. For museums, it serves as a great way to connect with teens. Your institution\u2019s expertise can go a long way when it comes to education programs that provide young people in your community an opportunity for growth. But intensive programming is a big commitment, as it involves more planning for a longer period of time and takes into consideration all that you want to offer young people interested in your field. Despite its challenges, the benefits are massive, as studies show the programs made available to adolescents through museums can positively influence the trajectory of their careers and outlook on life. The benefits for the museums themselves are hefty, as well. By establishing a relationship with teens in your community, you give yourself the opportunity to access fresh viewpoints and constructive criticism. You are giving yourself the opportunity to foster firsthand the next generation of museum-goers and appreciators.

Regardless of museum size and locale, data show that all children\u2019s museums excel in onsite and outreach programs and facilitate community growth in new ways, providing value that can extend far beyond onsite exhibits and programs. We explored 2016 ACM Membership Survey data to uncover how children\u2019s museums are engaging with their communities and to highlight opportunities to deepen impact and broaden engagement. For decades, children\u2019s museums have developed a rich range of onsite programming to draw visitors, promote learning, and ensure that children, schools, and families feel welcome in the space. This report describes some of the innovative types of onsite programs offered in 2016. It further looks at some of the types of outreach programs that children\u2019s museums took into their communities, extending their reach and expertise. Finally, this report explores how some children\u2019s museums are taking on leadership roles in community efforts to help residents and businesses thrive, moving beyond programming to becoming vital community partners. Rather than situating children\u2019s museums and outreach programs as destinations, this work repositions children\u2019s museums as leaders and collaborators, actively involved in the safety, growth, and wellbeing of the local community. In this report, we use size and locale categories established in Trends Report #1.7 to understand patterns in children\u2019s museums\u2019 community engagement.

Admit it, while you were waiting in the foyer just now did you think: \u2018Geez, I hope they don\u2019t mess this one up?\u2019 Fuck you! We\u2019re the same age Schiller was when he wrote The Robbers! \u2018Oh! Young people are performing in The Robbers, so I can visit it with my school class and take an exam on it.\u2019 Fuck you! \u2018Hopefully the play will mention Greta Thunberg and #metoo, the food industry, cruises, bullying, gentrification.\u2019 Fuck you!\u201d, the performers on stage shout, with raised middle fingers. In Joanna Praml\u2019s production of The Robbers, performers between the age of fourteen and twenty years old examine the themes raised in the Schiller classic, while also questioning their desire to be on stage. In doing so, they become a band of outlaws, holding all German artistic directors hostage under the stage, thus pointing out how society demands that this gener",

The program teaches young people and adults to create original dramatic works using their own life experiences, empowering individuals to think creatively, communicate effectively, and envision new futures. This process has been proven to increase self-esteem, reduce feelings of isolation, and improve communication and critical-thinking skills. The Theatre Lab\u2019s Life Stories program is fully funded and offered free to schools and social service partners. Our instructors typically go to schools and community partners once a week for 8-10 weeks to teach a theatre workshop. The program culminates in a performance or professional edited video featuring works devised and performed by the students themselves. We work with as few as 8 students or as many as 28 depending on the class structure.

While the country copes with the ravages of COVID-19 and begins to think about what a post-pandemic world might look like, it is worth considering how best to shape a sustainable future for the field of theater for young audiences (TYA). This report was prepared in partnership with the national association Theatre for Young Audiences/USA (TYA/USA). It follows a June 2019 meeting convened by the Arts Endowment, TYA/USA, and Theatre Communications Group to tackle some of the structural and societal challenges facing the field and consider ways to overcome those challenges. \u201cThe National Endowment for the Arts understands the role of theaters for young audiences in preparing our next generation to inherit a world that has become dramatically more complex,\u201d said Mary Anne Carter, chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. \u201cThe value of providing theater experiences for young people and supporting the organizations creating those experiences is even more vital now.\u201d \"At a moment when the TYA field (and the entire arts sector) faces so much uncertainty, this landmark report from the Arts Endowment is a shining light in the darkness.

Abstract Background: Urban African American adolescents and young adults (AYAs) face multiple barriers to effective engagement in health care, including access to primary and specialty care services resulting in significant disparities in care. Purpose: To conduct a needs assessment to enhance service delivery of AYAs at an urban federally qualified health center (FQHC) organization in Detroit. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted among pediatric staff members (N=11) using the community needs assessment approach specified for FQHCs. Results: The needs assessment determined the following priorities for AYAs seeking care at this FQHC organization: (1) mental health (e.g., depression and anxiety), (2) obesity, and (3) sexual health (e.g., sexually transmitted infection testing). Conclusion: When analyzing a population to learn about community-based issues, a needs assessment is a valuable tool. The information here has been used as supplemen",

We summarize recent literature and expand upon a prior conceptual access framework, adapted here specifically to urban and rural specialty care. Methods A systematic review was conducted of literature within the CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsycInfo, and ProQuest Social Sciences databases published between January 2013 and August 2018. Search terms targeted peer-reviewed academic publications pertinent to access to US urban or rural specialty healthcare. Exclusion criteria produced 67 articles. Findings were organized into an existing ten-dimension care access conceptual framework where possible, with additional topics grouped thematically into supplemental dimensions. Results Despite geographic and demographic differences, many access facilitators and barriers were common to both populations; only three dimensions did not contain literature addressing both urban and rural populations. The most commonly represented dimensions were availability and accommodation, appropriateness, and ability to perceive. Four new identified dimensions were: government and insurance policy, health organization and operations influence, stigma, and primary care and specialist influence. Conclusions While findings generally align with a preexisting framework, they also suggest several additional themes important to urban versus rural specialty care access. Peer Review reports Background Long delays or complete inaccessibility to primary and specialty care are common across the United States (US) [1, 2].

Abstract Eventually, all adolescents must \u201cgraduate\u201d from pediatric-oriented to adult-oriented health care. This transition, most often occurring during young adulthood, is especially important for adolescents with special health care needs and involves not only primary care physicians, but also both pediatric and adult subspecialists. Several studies support the benefit of transitional programs for adolescents and young adults with special health care needs. Additionally, the American Academy of Pediatrics named transitional care as one of its top priorities. However, transitional programs have yet to become an established norm among hospitals and providers, specifically outside of children\u2019s hospitals. This topic synopsis aims to draw attention to this important issue, review the rationale behind current recommendations and report the current status of transitional programs in North America. Moreover, the steps that individual clinicians, practices and health systems may take to plan for successful health care transitions are discussed.

Abstract Background: Urban African American adolescents and young adults (AYAs) face multiple barriers to effective engagement in health care, including access to primary and specialty care services resulting in significant disparities in care. Purpose: To conduct a needs assessment to enhance service delivery of AYAs at an urban federally qualified health center (FQHC) organization in Detroit. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted among pediatric staff members (N=11) using the community needs assessment approach specified for FQHCs. Results: The needs assessment determined the following priorities for AYAs seeking care at this FQHC organization: (1) mental health (e.g., depression and anxiety), (2) obesity, and (3) sexual health (e.g., sexually transmitted infection testing). Conclusion: When analyzing a population to learn about community-based issues, a needs assessment is a valuable tool. The information here has been used as supplemen",

Despite these challenges, there are pathways to ensure access to health care is equitable for all. By exploring the complexities of rural health inequities, we can strive to highlight solutions and advocate for a future where every individual has equal access to health care, regardless of their geographic location.\u00a0 Challenges faced by rural communities Rural communities contend with a significant scarcity of health care providers, with 68 physicians per 100,000 people compared to 80 in urban areas. This shortage underscores the struggle to access vital medical services, particularly specialty care. Many rural areas are located far from medical facilities, making it difficult for residents to access timely care, especially with limited public transportation. Additionally, rural communities often face higher rates of poverty and unemployment, which can impact residents' ability to afford services and secure transportation. These multifaceted challenges compound the challenges rural residents face and highlight the urgent need for targeted interventions. Geographical differences have a significant impact on health outcomes, but through the adoption of telehealth and other creative approaches, rural areas can overcome these barriers. In 2021, the initiation of the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment \u00a0Program marked a positive step toward establishing essential infrastructure in rural regions, making telehealth a feasible health care alternative. By leveraging data to identify gaps in health care access and outcomes, rural communities can develop targeted strategies to improve health care delivery.

Compared to those living in urban areas, rural residents have higher rates of mortality from heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, and unintentional injury which are the five leading causes of death in the U.S.3; higher maternal and infant mortality4; and higher rates of death by suicide.5 Overall, rural populations are older and sicker than those in urban areas, and face an increasing gap in life expectancy. These disparities are increasing over time.5,6 Public health emergencies like the coronavirus disease COVID-19 pandemic will further exacerbate these disparities7 [see Brief Statement, page 2].

At the heart of these disparities is a lack of access to health care, which can be exacerbated by a public health emergency like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Many rural areas have a shortage of health care providers and lack a hospital or similar facility. Many rural hospitals have closed or are at financial risk of closure, which further impairs the local health care workforce.

On average, rural residents are older and generally have worse health conditions than urban residents.

Today\u2019s WatchBlog post looks at both changes and challenges in rural health care access, as highlighted in our latest Health Care Capsule. Image Hospital closures and higher risks Having a local hospital or access to care is critical in an emergency situation where minutes can make a big difference. But we\u2019ve found that many rural residents are seeing their local hospital close. More than 100 (or 4% of) rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2020. As a result, residents had to travel about 20 miles farther for common services like inpatient care, and 40 miles farther for less common services, such as alcohol or drug misuse treatment. We also found, as you might expect, that rural areas without hospitals also generally had fewer health care providers overall compared to those without closures. People had to travel farther to get health care services after rural hospitals closed in their areas Image In addition to losing their hospitals, rural residents might also face additional health risks.

Here\u2019s some evidence to support the claim that an urban lifestyle contributes to one\u2019s health and wellness: Let\u2019s start with the obvious. Living in a more populated area naturally puts us closer to many things, including the healthcare industry. Hospitals, physicians\u2019 offices, and specialty health care facilities are closer to the patient in an urban environment. This is especially beneficial for seniors who may engage in more frequent healthcare visits or anyone diagnosed as being at-risk for an ER visit. This one contributes to the health of the individual as well as society. It\u2019s easy being green when you live in the city! Citizens who are committed to environmental stewardship will find city life appealing. Urban homesteading (i.e. growing one\u2019s own food and making one\u2019s own supplies) is no longer an alternative lifestyle. You can grow tomatoes, parsley, and carrots in a small space without being an expert on gardening. When the harvest is complete mulch the dry leaves and drop vegetables into the soil. Consider planting a second round including pumpkins and zinnias. You can also make your own laundry detergent in a small, urban kitchen as well. Some favorite tutorials for powder and liquid detergents can be found on the WellnessMama blog and HouseLogic.com. Plus, urban life typically comes with shorter commutes (if you even have to drive at all). Less time on the road before and after work or school means more time for recreation, family, or anything that helps you do you. You\u2019ll also spend less money on gas.

While individual factors of an urban environment have been investigated in isolation, no attempt has been made to model how complex, real-life exposure to living in the city relates to brain and mental health, and how this is moderated by genetic factors. Using the data of 156,075 participants from the UK Biobank, we carried out sparse canonical correlation analyses to investigate the relationships between urban environments and psychiatric symptoms. We found an environmental profile of social deprivation, air pollution, street network and urban land-use density that was positively correlated with an affective symptom group (r\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.22, Pperm\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001), mediated by brain volume differences consistent with reward processing, and moderated by genes enriched for stress response, including CRHR1, explaining 2.01% of the variance in brain volume differences. Protective factors such as greenness and generous destination accessibility were negatively correlated with an anxiety symptom group (r\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.10, Pperm\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001), mediated by brain regions necessary for emotion regulation and moderated by EXD3, explaining 1.65% of the variance.

Types of Specialty Hospitals and Why You Might Need Them Specialty hospitals focus on treating specific types of illnesses or injuries. Many parts of the country are served by rural health clinics or small nearby hospitals with very limited medical care, meaning almost any serious illness will require a trip to a more advanced medical facility. Unlike general hospitals, specialty hospitals have the appropriate equipment and staff trained to handle specific, higher-acuity health conditions. Let\u2019s look at four types of frequently needed specialty hospitals and why someone might require them instead of a smaller, nearby hospital. Children's Hospitals Children\u2019s hospitals focus on treating infants, children, and teenagers. These hospitals are designed to be child-friendly to help young patients feel more comfortable. They have pediatric specialists in various fields such as cancer, heart, and brain diseases. Children have unique medical needs that differ from adults. For example, a child\u2019s body processes medications differently, and some illnesses only happen in pediatric patients. Specialized care in a children\u2019s hospital ensures that young patients receive the right treatments for their age and developmental stage. Whether it\u2019s dealing with chronic illnesses like asthma or emergencies like broken bones, children\u2019s hospitals provide the specialty care that kids need. Burn Centers Burn centers specialize in treating patients who have suffered severe burns or burns to parts of the body which need advanced burn care (like the hands). These hospitals have advanced equipment for managing burn injuries, including special beds, wound care supplies, and skin grafting technology. If someone gets a severe burn from fire, chemicals, or electricity, they may need quick and specialized care. Burn centers provide treatments to prevent infections, manage pain, and help the skin heal. Quick and specialized treatment can make a big difference in the patient\u2019s recovery a",

Reprinted from The Milbank Memorial Fund Quarterly, Vol. 18, No. 4, 1940 (pp. 359\u201392). Style and usage are unchanged. The scope and emphasis of a public health program are necessarily influenced by the changing characteristics of the population it serves. The rate of population growth affects long-range planning of community health and medical facilities. Alterations in age composition, internal migration of racial or industrial groups, changes in population density and urban-rural movement require current adaptation of the health program to solve the new problems thus created. Among the various characteristics of recent population trends, aging of the population is one of the most fundamental in its bearing on national health. The social and economic effects of an aging population have long been recognized. Dr. Louis I. Dublin appraised the problem of old age in some detail in 1926, when the provision of economic security for the aged was the dominant theme of contemporary discussion.1 The passage of the Social Security Act in 1935 represented the fruits of the efforts of this early period. Adjustment of national policy with respect to the health problems associated with aging of the population has been slower in development. Under the terms of the Social Security Act, a limited expansion of activities designed to promote the health of older adults\u2014control of cancer and pneumonia, and industrial hygiene services\u2014has been mad",

We summarize recent literature and expand upon a prior conceptual access framework, adapted here specifically to urban and rural specialty care. Methods A systematic review was conducted of literature within the CINAHL, Medline, PubMed, PsycInfo, and ProQuest Social Sciences databases published between January 2013 and August 2018. Search terms targeted peer-reviewed academic publications pertinent to access to US urban or rural specialty healthcare. Exclusion criteria produced 67 articles. Findings were organized into an existing ten-dimension care access conceptual framework where possible, with additional topics grouped thematically into supplemental dimensions. Results Despite geographic and demographic differences, many access facilitators and barriers were common to both populations; only three dimensions did not contain literature addressing both urban and rural populations. The most commonly represented dimensions were availability and accommodation, appropriateness, and ability to perceive. Four new identified dimensions were: government and insurance policy, health organization and operations influence, stigma, and primary care and specialist influence. Conclusions While findings generally align with a preexisting framework, they also suggest several additional themes important to urban versus rural specialty care access.

Methods: Based on the survey data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in two phases, and by using the unbalanced panel-ordered logit model, stepwise analysis method, and KHB method, among others, we discuss the impact of city size on the disability rate of older adults. Results: The study finds that city size significantly and positively affects the activities of daily living (ADL) of older adults, with odd ratios of 1.3286 (95% CI = [1.082243, 1.631089]), and exhibits significant group heterogeneity in terms of age, registered residence, income, and education level. City size has indeed played an mediation role through the health improvement effect, disease mitigation effect, emotional effect, and employment structure optimization effect, with a cumulative contribution rate of the mediation effect of 35.17%.

Abstract Background Exploring the value orientation of city development from the perspective of people\u2019s well-being is key to clarifying the current debate on city size strategies. Methods Based on the survey data of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in two phases, and by using the unbalanced panel-ordered logit model, stepwise analysis method, and KHB method, among others, we discuss the impact of city size on the disability rate of older adults. Results The study finds that city size significantly and positively affects the activities of daily living (ADL) of older adults, with odd ratios of 1.3286 (95% CI\u2009=\u2009[1.082243, 1.631089]), and exhibits significant group h",

That pattern changes for Black males to include very high rates in the urban East and Midwest. For White females higher rates cluster in the Midwest and Mississippi Valley. There are likewise differences among states that mirror regional patterns. Within states, differences are associated with areas with lower incomes, higher numbers of minority populations, and cultural and historical risk factor patterns that contribute to higher rates of morbidity and mortality.

Franklin Street, Carolina Population Center, University of North Carolina \u2013 Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC; lizlaw@unc.edu Issue date 2017 Jul. Abstract U.S. young adults coming of age in the early 21st Century are the first cohort to grow up during the obesity epidemic; justifiably, there is much concern about their cardiovascular health. To date, however, no research has examined the extent to which there are disparities in young adult cardiovascular health across the urban-rural continuum. We examine this topic using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We find that young adults who live in metropolitan core areas exhibit more favorable cardiovascular health than individuals who live in smaller types of communities, and that population density largely accounts for this association. Further, individuals living in more densely populated areas in young adulthood relative to adolescence have better cardiovascular health than those who live in areas similar or less dense than their adolescent residence. Our results strongly suggest that the physical and social features of communities represent important contexts for young adult cardiovascular health.

Summary+ In the United States, people living in rural areas face significant disparities in access to healthcare, quality of treatment, and the presence of chronic physical and mental ailments. Given their geographic isolation, it is relatively difficult for these individuals to seek emergency care, an issue that is exacerbated by socioeconomic gaps. These relationships flow in both directions\u2014health and wealth often rise and fall in unison. Rural individuals also have to travel further to access healthcare, and the number of practitioners is sparse in comparison to metropolitan areas. Cultural and behavioral risks such as smoking, as well as the aforementioned shortage of healthcare professionals working in rural communities, contribute to disparities in both outcomes and access. One consequence of these disparities is that, in the United States, individuals living in rural areas also have life expectancies that are roughly two years shorter than their urban peers.1 Governmental and non-profit organizations have each instituted programs aimed at mitigating these disparities, but the gaps continue to widen. Programs like Mental Health First Aid can offer resources to the public that will help them bridge the gaps that rural people face in accessing quality, affordable healthcare.

Health disparities are differences in health status when compared to the population overall, often characterized by indicators such as higher incidence of disease and/or disability, higher mortality rates, lower life expectancies, and higher rates of chronic pain. Rural risk factors for health disparities include geographic isolation, lower socioeconomic status, higher rates of health risk behaviors, limited access to healthcare specialists and subspecialists, and limited job opportunities. Rural residents are also less likely to have employer-provided health insurance coverage, and if they are poor, often are not covered by Medicaid. Federal and state agencies, membership organizations, and foundations are working to reduce these disparities and improve the health and overall well-being of rural Americans. Some organizations provide funding, information, and technical assistance to be used at the state, regional, and local levels, while others work with policymakers to help them understand the issues affecting population health and healthcare in rural America. Published in 2017-2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) Rural Health Series examines rural mortality and preventable deaths, health-related behaviors, chronic disease, mental health services, and other topics related to rural health disparities. In addition to that series, the MMWR continues to publish reports that address rural health.

Compared to those living in urban areas, rural residents have higher rates of mortality from heart disease, respiratory disease, cancer, stroke, and unintentional injury which are the five leading causes of death in the U.S.3; higher maternal and infant mortality4; and higher rates of death by suicide.5 Overall, rural populations are older and sicker than those in urban areas, and face an increasing gap in life expectancy.

At the heart of these disparities is a lack of access to health care, which can be exacerbated by a public health emergency like the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Many rural areas have a shortage of health care providers and lack a hospital or similar facility.

Posted August 12, 2019 Many parents remember experiences they had as teen members of clubs or teams or organizations as among the highlights of their lives. Lifelong friends are made in summer camps; learning an instrument as a member of the band provides years of pleasure; leadership skills acquired as a member of student government can propel adult careers. A great deal of research suggests that participating in clubs and on teams in adolescence has the benefits that parents imagine. We know that organizations that provide structured, thoughtful activities can help teenagers learn self-control, do well in school, move onto college\u2014the range of benefits is quite wide. These experiences can also provide an understanding of the importance of rules for the sake of group success, the place of roles in building mutual trust, and accepting leadership or respecting it. Although some parents may over-schedule their kids, research seems to suggest that participating in activities, groups, clubs, and on teams provides dividends even for those who are quite busy. In today\u2019s rush to make their children competitive, some parents forget about the value of peers in forming positive social and moral values. For parents, then, the answer to the question \u201cShould I encourage my children to participate?\u201d is yes. In all likelihood, your child will have a good time and gain skills\u2014just like you did when you were a kid. Traditionally, youth groups have also contributed to civic life.

A new study finds lower rates of depression By Sarah Steimer Jul 28, 2021 UChicago researchers examine how socioeconomic networks, built environment affect well-being Large cities are often viewed as cold, fast-paced environments where crime rates are high and interpersonal interactions are fleeting\u2014a combination that makes them detrimental to mental health. But new research provides evidence for the opposite: The socioeconomic networks and built environments of larger urban areas in the U.S. can actually predict lower rates of psychological depression. The study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was led by University of Chicago researchers Andrew Stier, a doctoral student in integrative neuroscience; Marc Berman, an associate professor of psychology and in the UChicago Neuroscience Institute; and Lu\u00eds Bettencourt, a professor of ecology and evolution and associate faculty in sociology. The team\u2019s larger goal for the study was to quantify and systematize what it feels like to live in a city. They built their research on Bettencourt\u2019s work that shows how the infrastructure networks of cities\u2014 and how people move about such networks\u2014can lead to rapid increases in social interaction and entails higher rates of innovation and wealth production. \u201cWe wondered if those same principles and mathematical models could be applied to psychological phenomena, such as depression, to see if the actual social and infrastructure networks of cities\u2014and how they change as cities get larger\u2014could affect people's psychology in a consistent way,\u201d Stier said. According to Bettencourt, a key breakthrough in the field of urban science in recent years has been the understanding and measurement of the general properties of social networks in cities. This covers who\u2019s connected to whom and why, which explores social networks that include work relations, friendships, services, family\u00a0and beyond.

Increasing urbanization over the next three decades will be accompanied by a growing population of children and adolescents living in cities3. Shaping the aspects of urban life that influence youth mental health could have an enormous impact on adolescent well-being and adult trajectories4. We invited a multidisciplinary, global group of researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people to complete sequential surveys to identify and prioritize the characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for young people. Here we show a set of ranked characteristic statements, grouped by personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental domains of intervention. Life skills for personal development, valuing and accepting young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas and choices, providing safe public space for social connection, employment and job security, centring youth input in urban planning and design, and addressing adverse social determinants were priorities by domain. We report the adversities that COVID-19 generated and link relevant actions to these data. Our findings highlight the need for intersectoral, multilevel intervention and for inclusive, equitable, participatory design of cities that support youth mental health.

Whereas there is no lack of studies demonstrating the positive impact of volunteering activities on individuals and communities, there is limited understanding of linkages between the two in light of super-diversity. Moving beyond socio-economic integration, how does volunteering affect volunteers\u2019 sense of belonging? What does this furthermore mean in the context of increasingly diverse cities? In this article, we address the question of how young volunteers in Rotterdam and Vienna negotiate belonging in their super-diverse, urban surroundings. Our exploratory study builds on the VOLPOWER study, a cross-national research project on volunteerism, in which we have collected qualitative and quantitative interview data from volunteering youth. We are interested in the potential of volunteering to build means of identification for newcomers and locals alike, and in volunteers\u2019 individual politics of belonging. Our research contributes to the conceptualization of belonging, to capture societal identification processes more comprehensively than concepts such as integration do. We demonstrate the parallels and differences in the identification processes of newcomers and locals in terms of feelings of belonging in urban areas, transformed by volunteerism. Thereby we aim to demonstrate the limits and potential of volunteerism as a policy instrument to facilitate social inclusion against the backdrop of increasing diversity. Volunteering \u2013 navigating through a complex field Volunteering is a complex phenomenon that interests various scientific disciplines. Accordingly, there are many different definit",

A novel conceptual framework to bridge public health, planning, and neurourbanism Conceptual frameworks based on research from public health, planning, and neurourbanism can be used to promote the mental well-being of young people living in citiesMental illness among young people is a growing concern in many places around the world. Some research indicates a link between urban living and higher risk of serious mental illness. This study examined three areas of research \u2013 public health, planning, and neurourbanism \u2013 to better understand urban influences on young people\u2019s mental health. Neurourbanism is \u201ca multidisciplinary study of the effect of urban environments on mental health and brain activity.\u201d This line of research aims to connect public mental health to urban planning for the purpose of creating environments that promote the mental well-being of people living in cities. Information gathered from the selected areas of research was used to develop two novel conceptual frameworks focusing on the relationship between urban environments and young people\u2019s mental health. The frameworks provide a summary of key features, approaches, and ideas associated with each field.

Each framework also outlines areas where the three fields overlap and where they might collaborate.

Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately half of people in the US reported experiencing measurable levels of loneliness. Despite localized and select cross-sectional studies highlighting even higher increases in isolation/loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional research is needed, particularly for youth and young adults. This work examines patterns of isolation/loneliness across the US from 2016 to 2022 among individuals aged 24 and younger. Our study leverages a unique dataset, Crisis Text Line, which provides complete spatiotemporal coverage of crisis conversations in the US. We conducted a geospatial analysis using Kuldroff\u2019s Space\u2013Time SatScan to identify statistically significant clustering of elevated isolation/loneliness-related conversations. The statistical significance of spatiotemporal clusters was determined using Monte Carlo simulations (n\u2009=\u20099999).

Shared urban spaces, such as public amenities or commercial venues, offer settings for social interactions \u2014 be they for networking, learning or friendship. But the social benefits offered through such interactions are not open to everyone. Writing in Nature Cities, Cook et al.1 report that young people living in urban areas often struggle to take full advantage of the benefits of large cities. For instance, young people living in poverty tend to visit venues close to their homes, which are typically frequented by people with similar incomes.

Robyn Broadbent and Theo Papadopoulos Victoria University In 2008, the Helen Macpherson Smith (HMS) Trust commissioned Victoria University to conduct an evaluation of the Mentoring and Capacity Building Initiative\u2019s Regional Coordination Projects (RCPs). The RCPs are founded on a model of community education and collaboration that aims to enhance cross-sectoral and whole-of-community approaches to mentoring and community building. Their specific objectives are to: \u2022 coordinate effective regional delivery of new and existing mentoring programs and related activities \u2022 identify, document and share best practice mentoring models \u2022 strengthen community partnerships and collaboration, and the capacity and skills delivery of mentoring programs \u2022 develop cross-sectoral and whole-of-community approaches to mentoring. The aim of the evaluation was to determine the effectiveness of the RCPs in achieving these objectives, including the monitoring of program outcomes and strategic partnerships supporting these projects. This paper reports on some of the key findings of that evaluation. Introduction In 2008, the Helen Macpherson Smith (HMS) Trust commissioned Victoria University to conduct an evaluation of the Mentoring and Capacity Building Initiative (MCBI) Regional Coordination Projects (RCPs). The MCBI is an initiative of the Office for Youth (OFY), Department for Planning and Community Development, aimed at young people between the ages of 12 to 25. It has two key elements \u2013 MCBI Targeted Projects and MCBI Regional Coordination. The purpose of the MCBI is to provide an integrated, coordinated and evidenced-based approach to improving the quality of community-based youth mentoring programs in Victoria. There are 12 area-based Targeted Projects which aim to increase the number and capacity of youth mentoring projects in communities with high lev",

For some young people, models of healthy relationships and community are readily available. For other young people, healthy relationships may have been damaged or communities challenged, it is here that we have work to do in helping them thrive. As providers and advocates, we must engage and partner with systems (i.e justice, child welfare and homeless response) to prevent harmful policies and practices while also building restorative and empowering strategies to support this work. Youth Collaboratory recognizes the value and the power of something that seems so simple, but whose impact is so great- building relationship, building family, building community. Youth Collaboratory believes that: In that space, where generations come together in partnership to grow, true community is found. How We Build Community Youth Collaboratory plays a unique role in bringing together programs from across youth and young adult service sectors nationwide to do the work. This starts by using a Positive Youth Development framework as the grounding point for our approach to intentional practices and research that supports building communities with young people. Doing so allows space for young people to build assets, explore their strengths, and develop lasting connections. Building strong community starts small and close to home. The first step often starts with the family, and expands from there. We see family engagement as any way that a young person\u2019s biological, adopted, or chosen family can effectively be supported and/or support and contribute to positive outcomes.

It offers a framework understanding of current types of participatory processes in relation to urban landscape planning, and underlines lifeworld and action as two key components in transformative participatory processes with young people. The two-step scoping review of a literature sample (n\u2009=\u200944 studies) finds a prevalence of less-interactive approaches to young people\u2019s participation in urban landscapes, and subsequently analyses openings for lifeworld and action in the more interactive approaches described (n\u2009=\u200917 studies). The interactive methods described demonstrate opportunities to facilitate young people\u2019s own articulations of lifeworlds within the urban landscape, especially in extended processes deploying multiple creative methods. The relatively few examples of actions and interventions resulting from participatory processes points to the need for further development and the ambition to include young people in transforming urban landscapes towards increased sustainability.

In this paper, we address the question of how young volunteers in Rotterdam and Vienna negotiate belonging within their super-diverse surroundings.

Shared urban spaces, such as public amenities or commercial venues, offer settings for social interactions \u2014 be they for networking, learning or friendship. But the social benefits offered through such interactions are not open to everyone. Writing in Nature Cities, Cook et al.1 report that young people living in urban areas often struggle to take full advantage of the benefits of large cities. For instance, young people living in poverty tend to visit venues close to their homes, which are typically frequented by people with similar incomes.

Abstract Neighbourhood characteristics can facilitate or hinder the development of social ties, thereby influencing the loneliness of those who live in them. Most research to date has focused upon how either older adults (65+) or youth (under 19 years old) view and experience their neighbourhood, paying little attention to young adults (aged 16\u201324). Young adults are the loneliest age-group within the UK and other Western countries. Their loneliness is associated with living in deprived communities (e.g., areas experiencing social-economic inequalities), feeling a strong sense of disconnection from their neighbourhoods and having little trust in others within these spaces. Therefore, this study utilises social representations theory to explore how young adults (18\u201324 years old) from London's four most deprived boroughs view and experience their neighbourhood using a systematic, qualitative methodology.

Abstract This paper aims to illustrate just a few of the positive influences social media technologies have had thus far on communities by bringing people together for open discussions and sharing of interests and ideals through political activism, creation of online communities and strengthening relationships with family and friends. By concentrating on the positive aspects of social media technologies on communities this paper attempts to instill confidence and enthusiasm to all those using social media platforms but especially those who may be a little hesitant in embracing the full potential social media has to offer. Introduction Communities have existed from the dawn of mankind and have continuously evolved with advancements in industry and technology. Communities have developed over time from small close-knit groups where everyone knew each other intimately to the vast communities of today where members can global. Social media has contributed positively to the fostering of strong communities, creating diverse and widespread networks and feelings of belonging within those communities by allowing people to communicate freely on multiple levels through a simple and efficient means of communication. In this regard social media could be seen to have opened up channels of communication to users from all \u2018walks of life\u2019.

Verified by Psychology Today Can Social Media and Online Communities Be Good for Us? Virtual communities can provide social support, belongingness, and resilience. Posted March 28, 2023 | Reviewed by Michelle Quirk Key points In the wake of a national survey by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that showed alarming statistics about the prevalence of depression, hopelessness, and thoughts of suicide among adolescents, there has been increasing concern about social media and its impact on mental health. Legislation to limit young people\u2019s access to social media has been in the news, as well as calls to ban the popular app TikTok. Parents and researchers alike worry about social media\u2019s impact on eating disorders, thanks to algorithms that inflate content on body image, and on self-esteem, with the preponderance of images easily altered to present perfection. Online bullying has also impacted depression risks, since the humiliation experienced by someone who is bullied is no longer limited to a few peers who happened to be in the hallway\u2014now a video of the incident is sometimes online forever, able to be watched by thousands. But are social media sites and the online communities that are formed there always a negative influence? There is some research that suggests that there can be positive effects. Social Support and Happiness It is increasingly clear that social support is critical for happiness and a sense of well-being. Social and emotional connectivity is one of the most powerful weapons against stress, loneliness, and depression. Having a support network is linked to greater resilience and even lessens the likelihood of developing symptoms of posttraumatic stress.

Abstract Landscapes are changing, with rural areas becoming increasingly urbanized. Children and adolescents are underrepresented in the sense-of-place literature. Our study aimed to understand how adolescent residents of a rural\u2013urban transition area perceive and value their urbanizing landscape by examining sense of place and perceptions of landscape change. A Public Participation GIS approach, accompanied by a questionnaire survey, was applied to elicit responses from a sample of 747 students aged 12\u201318 in Colmenar Viejo, Madrid (Spain). Respondents\u2019 sense of \u201cself-in-place\u201d or home range was small, around 1\u2009km, although valued places were identified up to around 17\u2009km away, and occasionally further afield. Most responses were associated with urban land, with clear difference between the urban core, strongly associated with emotions, and the suburbs, with activities.

Abstract This study investigates the differences in place identity between residents of rural and urban communities. Differently from previous research comparing place identity between neighborhoods or countries, our study focuses on the local community type (urban or rural) as a key determinant of place identity. This fills a research gap in environmental social psychology, frequently ignoring the role of community type in shaping people's relationship with their local community. In particular, we analyze to what extent residents of rural communities present greater levels of cognitive, affective and evaluative place identity than their urban counterparts. Based on data from 1153 residents of Spanish rural and urban areas, results reveal that there is no difference between both environments in cognitive place identity. However, residents in rural communities show greater levels of affective and evaluative place identity than city dwellers. In addition, age moderates the influence of community type (urban",

The country is growing in numbers, it\u2019s becoming more racially and ethnically diverse and the population is aging. But according to a new analysis by Pew Research Center, these trends are playing out differently across community types. Urban areas are at the leading edge of racial and ethnic change, with nonwhites now a clear majority of the population in urban counties while solid majorities in suburban and rural areas are white. Urban and suburban counties are gaining population due to an influx of immigrants in both types of counties, as well as domestic migration into suburban areas. In contrast, rural counties have made only minimal gains since 2000 as the number of people leaving for urban or suburban areas has outpaced the number moving in. And while the population is graying in all three types of communities, this is happening more rapidly in the suburbs than in urban and rural counties. At the same time, urban and rural communities are becoming increasingly different from each other politically. Adults in urban counties, long aligned with the Democratic Party, have moved\u00a0even more to the left in recent years, and today twice as many urban voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic as affiliate with the Republican Party. For their part, rural adults have moved more firmly into the Republican camp. More than half (54%) of rural voters now identify with or lean to the GOP, while 38% are Democrats or lean Democratic. Against this backdrop, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that many urban and rural residents feel misunderstood and looked down on by Americans living in other types of communities.

Start by deciding whether you\u2019d prefer to attend college in a city, rural area\u00a0or the suburbs. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the benefits of going to college in the city. If these benefits sound exciting to you, apply to several big city colleges when you submit your college applications. A big city college, or urban college, places you in the hustle and bustle of city life. Some urban colleges have buildings spread throughout the city, making the city feel like part of your college campus. Others are more contained. Either way, you\u2019ll live and learn in close proximity to a major city. Examples of city colleges include: Now, let\u2019s take a look at the benefits of going to college in a big city. \u00a0 Big cities typically mean big businesses. Going to school in a busy, thriving city gives you access to more internship and career opportunities. Not only will you have more opportunities, but you\u2019ll likely have higher profile opportunities too.\u00a0 In a big city, there are more people to meet and network with, which can also help you make valuable connections and jumpstart your future career. Plus, large and growing cities are home to innovation, creativity and new ideas, which generates a certain energy and excitement for ambitious and motivated young people. Of course, opportunities exist everywhere. However, the frequency and diversity of these opportunities are greater in urban areas.

Blog post published on 2 October 2015 by Elli Thomas Over the past week, record numbers of young people have headed off to university, with more than 409,000 students expected to begin studies at higher education institutions this autumn. As our recent report Urban Demographics\u00a0shows, this will have a profound impact on cities across the UK, as more than two thirds of English and Welsh students are based in urban areas (2.5m people in total). Unsurprisingly, it is large cities, home to a number of different universities and higher education institutions, which are attracting the highest number of student residents \u2013 with London alone accounting for 21 per cent of the total number of students in England and Wales. But what\u2019s more interesting is where in cities students are moving to, with the large expansion of student numbers in recent years having had a big impact on our city centres in particular. As Urban Demographics\u00a0shows, students accounted for 44 per cent of overall population growth in city centres in England and Wales from 2001-2011, and for 54 per cent of the population growth in the large city centres in that time. Change in economic activity across city centres, 2001-2011 This meant that by 2011 students made up nearly a quarter of the total city centre population of cities in England and Wales (and 44 per cent of residents in large city centres) \u2013 highlighting the huge impact that university campuses and accommodation are having in shaping city centre populations This trend among students is reflective of a wider boom in the number of people living in city centres living since the start of the century, a resurgence led by young professionals as well as students, with both groups seemingly attracted to city centre living by the same factor \u2013 the prospect of living close to work.

View all partners With tuition fees in England set to rise to \u00a39,250 and interest rates on loans escalating from 4.6% to 6.1% this autumn, students are rightly asking what return they are getting for their investment. Jo Johnson, minister for universities, science, research and innovation, has called for the Office for Students \u2013 a new regulatory body coming online in 2018 \u2013 to look into legally binding contracts between universities and students. This aim is to provide \u201cconsumer\u201d protection as regards the quality of tuition. The government is also looking for a more direct return on public investment in higher education. As Brexit looms on the horizon, universities are being asked to assume a leading role in the UK\u2019s new industrial strategy. But the pending loss of European funding, expertise and collaborations means they are going to have to do more with less. In this way, understanding how universities can best help revitalise the fortunes of regions, anchor growth and support sustainable futures has emerged as a key strategic policy question on both sides of the \u201ctown-gown\u201d divide. So how do universities transform their neighbourhoods, cities, regions and nations? 1. Universities are economic engines Universities are hotbeds of innovation and entrepreneurship. In partnership with government and business, academic research and technologies help to drive an array of vital industries.

What are the reasons? Do the advantages of this development outweigh the drawbacks? The comparison between the standards of living in cities and those in small towns or villages has always been a topic of debate. Recently, many teenagers have chosen to live in cities instead of their home villages due to better educational and job opportunities. This essay will explore the various reasons behind this trend and explain why the advantages of urban living outweigh the drawbacks. There are several compelling reasons for wanting to live in urban areas. Firstly, cities provide access to superior educational institutions that are often unavailable in rural regions. In today\u2019s world, education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals\u2019 futures, making it essential for them to obtain higher degrees to secure well-paying jobs. Additionally, city life offers experiences that are vastly different from those in rural areas. By attending schools, working, and socializing in urban environments, individuals have the chance to meet a larger number of people from diverse backgrounds, which is vital for personal development. Lastly, cities offer a broader array of job opportunities, allowing residents to earn higher salaries. It is well-known that the job market in villages is significantly limited, and the available positions often do not provide a livable wage. Clearly, the benefits of leaving rural areas outweigh the few shortcomings associated with urban living. It is important to acknowledge that moving to the city can present challenges, such as being away from extended family, facing a more competitive job market, and dealing with a significantly higher cost of living. However, the advantages\u2014such as gaining new experiences, obtaining a better education leading to higher-paying jobs, and pursuing an interesting career\u2014far surpass these drawba",

Abstract We investigated how learning environments\u2013involving their physical, pedagogical, and psychosocial dimensions\u2013influence students learning experiences in an Australian Faculty of Business and Economics. Qualitative data collection involved observations of eight classrooms over a semester, four focus groups with 21 students and interviews with six educators. The study provided deeper understanding of the dynamic and complex intrinsic interrelations of learning environment dimensions over time, addressing previous gaps in research. It identified and analysed spaces and practices, educational activities, and students\u2019 subjective experiences in different learning environments to illustrate how these multiple elements intersect and influence on the students\u2019 experience. The mixed methods used in the research helped to uncover a broader view of the learning environment and its interdependent influences over time on students\u2019 learning experiences. One practical implication is that any strategies to support a more holistic student learning experience through more eff",

The Relationship Between Residential Learning Communities and Student The Relationship Between Residential Learning Communities and Student Engagement Engagement Abstract Abstract Residential learning communities (RLCs) are residence hall environments designed to deliver academic and social benefits. For decades, many have argued RLCs are an effective means for increasing student success. Yet substantial changes in the defining characteristics of campus housing and student diversity have led to new questions about the impact of living on campus and the benefits of RLCs in particular. Consequently, we investigated the continued efficacy of RLCs as an effective educational practice. Using data from a diverse, multi-institution sample of first-year and sophomore students, this study provides insight into the relationships between RLC participation, student engagement, and perceived gains in learning.

But the true definition extends beyond that simple definition.\u00a0 Urban schools generally encompass a diverse student body, reflecting various cultures, languages, and socioeconomic backgrounds. These schools often serve a high concentration of low-income students, students of color, and students for whom English is a second language. They may also be faced with larger class sizes and fewer resources, leading to overworked and, oftentimes, underpaid teachers.In an elementary school setting\u2014where children first learn to read, write, and navigate the world outside their homes\u2014those realities can be more pressing.\u00a0\u00a0 Given the right resources and proper training, however, these facts can make urban schools into more interesting and productive learning environments for both students and teachers.\u00a0 \u00a0 Challenges Facing Urban Schools As we mentioned, urban schools face particular obstacles when it comes to serving their communities.

From struggling to manage time to dealing with homesickness, these issues can be overwhelming. But for each problem, there\u2019s a solution. In this article, we\u2019ll explore 16 common student problems and provide actionable solutions to help navigate these hurdles. 1. Time Management Problem: Students often struggle with balancing their academic responsibilities, extracurricular activities, and social life. Poor time management leads to stress, missed deadlines, and academic underperformance. Solution: Create a daily schedule that prioritizes tasks. Use time management tools such as apps or planners to track assignments, study periods, and breaks. Set realistic goals and break large tasks into manageable chunks to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Consistency in planning is key to staying organized and reducing stress. 2. Experiencing Low Motivation Problem: Maintaining motivation throughout the academic year can be difficult, especially when faced with repetitive tasks or subjects that don't spark interest. This lack of drive can hinder performance. Solution: Set both short-term and long-term goals that are specific, measurable, and attainable. Celebrate small achievements to stay motivated. Identify the underlying reasons for low motivation\u2014whether it's burnout, boredom, or lack of interest\u2014and address these by switching up your routine or seeking inspiration from new challenges. 3. Lack of Concentration Problem: Concentration is crucial for effective studying, but distractions or mental fatigue can make it difficult to focus for extended periods. Solution: To improve concentration, create a designated study area free from distractions. Use techniques like the Pomodoro method (working in intervals of 25 minutes followed by 5-minute breaks) to maintain focus. Regular exercise, adequate sleep, an",

However, until recently, labor force characteristics for Illinois and other states were only available on annual basis. As part of our special topic series, the Illinois Department of Employment Security, will be releasing more current labor force characteristics for Illinois using 12-month moving average estimates from the Current Population Survey (CPS) developed by the U.S. BLS. One of the labor force characteristics that we will release each month is educational attainment level for the non-institutional population, 25 years of age and older. Educational attainment is collapsed into four groups including: less than a high school diploma; high school graduate, no college; some college or associate degree; and bachelor\u2019s degree or higher. The key findings from our analysis of educational attainment levels and labor force, employment and unemployment status are shown below, using 12-month moving average estimates starting in 2007 through 2017. A\u00a0report including the average estimates depicted\u00a0in the charts below will be updated each month and found here\u200b. In addition, you can find a\u00a0glossary of terms and concepts used in the CPS here. Unemployment Rates by Educational Attainment Level The chart below shows 12-month moving average unemployment rates by educational attainment level. As would be expected, there is an inverse relationship between unemployment rates and educational attainment; the higher the level of educational attainment, the lower the unemployment rate. The average unemployment rates among the lowest three educational attainment levels converged at various times during the past decade but only temporarily.

This research sought to investigate the process of \u2018studentification\u2019. The research asked: What areas become dominated by student houses, and why? What are the key consequences of studentification in terms of the social cohesion in a locality, cultural lifestyles, economic regeneration, and the physical fabric of buildings? In short, the research asks: is studentification a good thing, and if so, why? The term \u2018studentification\u2019 was established by Smith (2002) to describe the growth of high concentrations of students within the localities of Higher Education Institutions. These students are often accommodated within Houses of Multiple Occupancy (HMOs), but increasingly in purpose built student flats. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, in 2011-12 there were 2,496,645 students in higher education, and 1,928,140 of these were undergraduates (www.hesa.ac.uk). Findings The research found that there are four dimensions to the studentification process: \u2022 Social: the replacement and/or displacement of established residents with a transient, generally young and single, social grouping. \u2022 Cultural: the growth in number of young people with shared cultures, lifestyles, and consumption practices, which in turn results in the increase of certain types of retail and service infrastructure. \u2022 Economic: the inflation of property prices and a change in the balance of the housing stock resulting in neighbourhoods becoming dominated by private rented accommodation and houses of multiple occupation, and decreasing levels of owner-occupation. \u2022 Physical: the downgrading or upgrading of the physical environment, depending on the local context. On the whole, the positive effects of \u2018studentification\u2019 are that students tend to increase the levels of spending in the local economy and improve the opportunities for spin-off companies, educational, cultural and other arts events, concerts and pe",

At the local level they are known for having a steady presence in a locale, for attracting revenue from within and outside their host community, providing jobs on different levels and relatively resistant to business fluctuation cycles. A university town is described as a town or in some cases a suburb of a city which is dominated socially, economically and culturally by its university population. One of the most prominent influences of a university on its host community is the phenomena termed \u2018studentification\u2019. This paper investigates the effects of studentification on the residential neighbourhood and businesses of a university suburb and how the social, cultural, economic and environmental impacts of the studentification affect the residential neighbourhood and businesses in the suburb. The case study was focused on the University of Cape Town (UCT) in Rondebosch, Rosebank and Mowbray. The research revealed the existence of a unique student housing market and opens new areas of research into the patterns, distribution and implications for the formation of student areas. Moreover, it raises the issue of the trade-off between the apparent profitability of the student market and the implications for urban facilities management and the demographic balance in these areas.

Plus, the college itself will throw fun events for the students to enjoy, will have plenty of students orgs and clubs, and provide entertainment for study breaks. CON: Away from Opportunities Rural colleges tend to be smaller, and away from major employment opportunities. While there may be some odd-jobs on campus, students might have to drive into town for jobs or internships. PRO: Tight-Knight Community Since rural colleges tend to be smaller, the student body typically become tight-knit. Forging close friendships is a highlight of college, and rural campuses do it well.

And colleges in rural locations are often summarily dismissed in favor of urban counterparts.\u00a0 This year has changed everything about the college search Enter the pandemic, which continues to change everything, including how we think about size and place. What was once a challenge for small, rural liberal arts colleges is now a straight-up virtue \u2014 one magnified by their ability to respond quickly and imaginatively to the moment. At Bennington College, where I was interim president last year, we shifted with remarkable speed to remote learning, developed health and safety protocols, and adjusted policies in real-time to mitigate the sudden financial hardship experienced by many students.\u00a0 We were not alone. Both last spring, and in the national return to college this fall, smaller schools in rural areas stood out, making compelling plans and largely sticking to them. Beloit College was among the first to announce a reimagined academic structure and calendar, allowing students to be either in-person or remote to keep them on track to degree. In these uncertain times for higher education, institutional nimbleness has major value. The top four reasons that small, rural liberal arts colleges merit attention Reasons for students and families to seek out small, rural liberal arts colleges go, however, far beyond their handling of the pandemic.

Today, we at CollegeVine have set out to discuss another important facet of the difficult process of choosing a school: whether to attend school in an urban, suburban, or rural setting. All three options offer significantly different experiences in terms of student life, extracurricular activities, and more. If you\u2019re struggling to decide between attending school in a bustling city, a serene wilderness setting, or a quaint suburb, we\u2019re here to help. Rural If you\u2019re an outdoorsy person, then you should definitely consider attending school in a rural setting. Cornell University, for example, located in the small town of Ithaca in Upstate New York, features a gorgeous natural setting that offers students opportunities to engage with their surroundings in extracurricular, athletic, and recreational contexts. From hiking clubs to crew teams to a romp in the surrounding forest on a weekend, students with a penchant for exploring the great outdoors will thrive in at a school in a rural setting. Another advantage of attending school in a more rural area is the lack of, or at least decreased number of distractions. For many students, those attending school in urban settings particularly, the temptation to eschew academic responsibilities for the exciting activities a city offers can jeopardize performance in school and wreck carefully-honed time management skills.

The influence of funding sources and subdivision 1099 Accesses 9 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Research funding is a significant support for the development of scientific research. The inequality of research funding is an intrinsic feature of science, and policy makers have realized the over-concentration of funding allocation. Previous studies have tried to use the Gini coefficient to measure this inequality; however, the phenomena of multiple funding sources and funding subdivision have not been deeply discussed and empirically studied due to limitations on data availability. This paper provides a more accurate analysis of the distribution inequality of research funding, and it considers all of the funding sources in the funding system and the subdivision of funding to junior researchers within research teams. We aim to determine the influence of these two aspects of the Gini results at the individual level. A dataset with 68,697 project records and 80,380 subproject records from the Chinese Academy of Sciences during the period from 2011 to 2015 is collected to validate the problem. The empirical results show that (1) the Gini coefficient for a single funding source is biased and may be overestimated or underestimated, and the most common data source, which is the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), causes the Gini coefficient to be underestimated; and (2) considering the subdivision of research funding lowers the inequality of research funding, with a smaller Gini coefficient, although the decrease is moderate.

Discussions about the persistent imbalances in resource allocation for health research between rich and poor countries are not new, but little or no progress has been made in redressing these imbalances over the years. This is critical not only for emergency preparedness, but for the worlds\u2019 ability to improve population health in an equitable manner. Concerned with the lack of progress in this area, Member States of the World Health Organization requested the establishment of a Global Observatory on Health Research and Development, with the aim of consolidating, monitoring and analyzing relevant information on health research and development, with a view to informing the coordination and prioritization of new investments. In this commentary, we highlight some of the striking disparities from the Observatory\u2019s analysis over the 5\u00a0years since its establishment and reflect on what is needed to overturn stagnant progress. Peer Review reports Background Among the insights that the COVID-19 pandemic has offered the world is the realization that it is possible for the global community to unite in mobilizing resources and technical expertise to accelerate the development of needed health technologies. But COVID-19 pandemic also emphasized how complicated it is to ensure equitable distribution and access to these lifesaving technologies across rich and poor countries [1].

Faced with rising tuition costs, student loan debt, and an ever-competitive job market, finding affordable and stable housing is often a significant challenge for this demographic. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted employment and housing stability for many young people. Thus, addressing the specific housing needs of young adults is more urgent than ever. Housing affordability directly impacts the opportunities available to young adults, influencing their ability to secure stable employment, pursue higher education, and build independent lives. Without affordable housing, these individuals may find themselves trapped in a cycle of instability, moving frequently, or even experiencing homelessness. Creating affordable housing options for young adults isn\u2019t just a matter of finance; it\u2019s a broader issue involving urban planning, community development, and policy making. Young adults require housing that is not only affordable but also conveniently located near education institutions, employment opportunities, and public transportation.

Due in part to high home prices and relatively low earnings, young adults often rent instead of buying a home. Choosing an affordable place to live with plenty of other young people who can share housing costs can help ease the financial burden of living away from one's parents. However, both cost of living and the young adult demographic can vary greatly by location. Paying an entire monthly rent bill is often out of the question for young adults who are either still in college or are just starting out in their careers. As a result, young adults frequently live with others to lessen the financial burden of rent. Just 5% of young adults ages 18 to 24 live alone. Most young adults (69%) live with their parents or other relatives, and nearly one-fifth live with roommates (such as a non-spouse partner or nonrelatives). Living with roommates has become much more common over the last few decades; in 1967, just 2.8% of people ages 18 to 24 lived with roommates. Living with roommates has become a necessity for some young adults due to rising rent costs. Since 2000, rental affordability has been steadily declining. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rental Affordability Index measures whether a typical renter household has enough income to qualify for a lease on a typical rental home. A Rental Affordability Index of 100 or higher means the median income can afford the median rent (assuming that no more than 30% of income goes towards rent). In the last quarter of 2000, the Rental Affordability Index was 138.2. The most recent Rental Affordability Index was 92.7, meaning the typical renter is unable to afford the median rental home. This is the lowest the index has been since HUD began tracking the metric. When deciding where to live, one important factor other than affordability is being around other similarly aged ",

In the same 2021 survey, 70% of Americans said young adults today have a harder time buying a home than their parents\u2019 generation did. A variety of factors have set the stage for the financial challenges American homeowners and renters have been facing in the housing market, including incomes that haven\u2019t kept pace with housing cost increases and a housing construction slowdown. A surge in homebuying spurred by record low mortgage interest rates during the COVID-19 pandemic has further strained the availability of homes. Here are some of the key measures of the housing affordability crunch in the United States and the reasons behind it. This Pew Research Center analysis about housing affordability in America draws from Center surveys designed to understand Americans\u2019 views and preferences for where they live. It also uses outside data from sources including the Federal Reserve Bank and the U.S. Census Bureau.

Faced with rising tuition costs, student loan debt, and an ever-competitive job market, finding affordable and stable housing is often a significant challenge for this demographic. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted employment and housing stability for many young people. Thus, addressing the specific housing needs of young adults is more urgent than ever. Housing affordability directly impacts the opportunities available to young adults, influencing their ability to secure stable employment, pursue higher education, and build independent lives. Without affordable housing, these individuals may find themselves trapped in a cycle of instability, moving frequently, or even experiencing homelessness. Creating affordable housing options for young adults isn\u2019t just a matter of finance; it\u2019s a broader issue involving urban planning, community development, and policy making. Young adults require housing that is not only affordable but also conveniently located near education institutions, employment opportunities, and public transportation. Understanding the multifaceted nature of this issue is crucial for developing effective solutions.

Due in part to high home prices and relatively low earnings, young adults often rent instead of buying a home. Choosing an affordable place to live with plenty of other young people who can share housing costs can help ease the financial burden of living away from one's parents. However, both cost of living and the young adult demographic can vary greatly by location. Paying an entire monthly rent bill is often out of the question for young adults who are either still in college or are just starting out in their careers. As a result, young adults frequently live with others to lessen the financial burden of rent. Just 5% of young adults ages 18 to 24 live alone. Most young adults (69%) live with their parents or other relatives, and nearly one-fifth live with roommates (such as a non-spouse partner or nonrelatives). Living with roommates has become much more common over the last few decades; in 1967, just 2.8% of people ages 18 to 24 lived with roommates. Living with roommates has become a necessity for some young adults due to rising rent costs. Since 2000, rental affordability has been steadily declining. The Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Rental Affordability Index measures whether a typical renter household has enough income to qualify for a lease on a typical rental home. A Rental Affordability Index of 100 or higher means the median income can afford the median rent (assuming that no more than 30% of income goes towards rent). In the last quarter of 2000, the Rental Affordability Index was 138.2. The most recent Rental Affordability Index was 92.7, meaning the typical renter is unable to afford the median rental home. This is the lowest the index has been since HUD began tracking the metric. When deciding where to live, one important factor other than affordability is being around other similarly aged ",

Co-living spaces, characterized by shared amenities, flexible leases, and a sense of community, have gained significant traction as an innovative response to the challenges of urban housing. In this article, we explore the rise of co-living spaces, their appeal to younger generations, and the unique advantages they bring to the modern housing scene. Redefining Urban Living As urban centers continue to experience population growth and increased housing demand, traditional living arrangements often become financially burdensome and socially isolating. Co-living spaces, however, redefine the concept of urban living by offering a more affordable and socially connected alternative. Shared Amenities and Common Spaces One of the hallmarks of co-living spaces is the emphasis on shared amenities and communal areas. Residents typically have access to fully furnished common spaces, including kitchens, lounges, and recreational areas. This fosters a sense of community and encourages social interaction among residents. -- -- Written by News Flash Network of bloggers, information junkies, news lovers, and pop culture addicts.

The influence of Generation Z on the housing market is impossible to ignore. This generation, born between 1997 and 2012, is reshaping how developers, investors and industry professionals approach residential properties. Unlike previous generations, Gen Z is guided by distinctive values and preferences, prompting a significant shift in residential property demand. In a world where traditional homeownership is no longer a universal goal, this group brings a fresh perspective on what it means to have a home that reflects their lifestyles, priorities and ambitions. What Sets Gen Z\u2019s Housing Preferences Apart? Gen Z\u2019s housing expectations differ markedly from those of their predecessors. Flexibility, technology and environmentally conscious features are top priorities, with many preferring rental properties over ownership. Unlike Baby Boomers and even Millennials, Gen Z often chooses experiences over material wealth and seeks convenience, connectivity and functionality in their living spaces. For developers and investors, understanding this demand is crucial. Gen Z is motivated by values of well-being, adaptability and efficiency in their choice of homes. They\u2019re drawn to properties that balance personal freedom, tech readiness and community-oriented design, all geared toward a lifestyle emphasizing purpose and balance. Why Lifestyle Compatibility Is Key Gen Z\u2019s approach to housing places a premium on lifestyle compatibility. Instead of simply seeking proximity to work or family, they want homes that fit an integrated work-life model.

This section delves into the rankings of cities with the highest and lowest cost of living in the U.S. Highest Cost of Living Cities Several cities in the United States are renowned for their high cost of living, driven primarily by housing expenses, taxes, and the general price level of goods and services. Manhattan in New York tops the list with living costs 122% higher than the national average. Housing expenses in Manhattan are 4.8 times the national average, significantly contributing to the high cost of living (CNBC). The presence of a large number of affluent families also drives up average housing costs, further inflating the cost of living (CNBC). For more information on cities with high living costs, visit our article on highest cost of living cities. Lowest Cost of Living Cities Conversely, some cities in the U.S. offer a much lower cost of living, making them attractive to individuals seeking affordability. Harlingen, Texas, stands out as the city with the cheapest cost of living, where residents pay about 25% less than the average American for living expenses (CNBC). The city's low taxes, affordable housing, and proximity to inexpensive gas contribute to its affordability. However, it faces challenges due to a relatively high rate of poverty.

Our second annual RentHop Singles Index looks at the cost of rent for a studio apartment in each city, how these rents have changed over the past year, and whether living alone is affordable given average local incomes. Least Affordable Cities for Singles 1. New York, NY is the least affordable city in America for singles. After placing second last year, NYC experienced a meteoric rise in rent prices in 2022 which led to it overtaking Miami for our top spot.

Raleigh, NC is the fourth least affordable city for singles, with rent commanding almost 30% of the average single person\u2019s annual income. There was one bright spot, however. As compared to other growing cities, studio apartments in Raleigh only saw a modest 3.5% annual increase in price. 5. Despite a high median singles salary of $100K, expensive rent prices in Boston, MA continue to make things difficult. A studio in the city is now up to $2,400 per month, leading to a rent burden of 28.68% of income annually. Most Affordable Cities for Singles 1. Alb",

Mulder1 Abstract In this paper I explore the relationship between population and housing. I argue that this relationship is two-sided. On the one hand, the size of a population, and particularly the number of households, determines the demand for housing. On the other hand, the availability of suitable and affordable housing may attract certain categories of migrants. It also influences young people\u2019s opportunities to leave the parental home, marry or cohabit, and have children. Furthermore, home-ownership hampers residential mobility and migration by binding people to a place. 1 University of Amsterdam, Department of Geography, Planning and International Development Studies, Nie",

After all, it makes sense that a community with a population of 2,000 would require different solutions than cities the size of New York or Los Angeles. But while this approach holds some merit, the truth is that when addressing issues like housing and homelessness, size is just one piece of the puzzle. In our new report Housing Market Conditions Across America\u2019s Cities, NLC found that when we put population count aside and focus on other characteristics, the housing crisis in cities like Columbia, Missouri (population: 123,180) and New York City (population: 8.623 million) begin to look similar despite differences in size and geography. The report examines all 754 cities with populations greater than 50,000 and uncovers six housing market types: Exploring the interactions among demographic, economic and housing supply features in each city helps us understand how well each city\u2019s permitting of single- and multi-family housing is meeting the income levels and job growth opportunities of residents. In Columbia, Missouri\u2014home to the famed University of Missouri and lovingly called Mizzou\u2014residents have average college degree attainment compared to the nation, and low median incomes; 56 percent of residents spend over 30 percent of that income on rent, meaning they are rent burdened. New York City is strikingly similar, where a little less than half of residents hold a college degree and have below average median income; 54 percent of residents are rent burdened. Both Columbia and New York City are considered rent-burdened cities, characterized by having low median incomes and low job growth, though New York City has a much higher gender income gap of 28 percent (the percent by which male incomes exceed female incomes). In many cities classified as such, rent prices are rising, while wages remain stagnant. In general, NLC f",

Introduction: Communities and American Ideals Public conversation about the future of communities is often dominated by debates about talent attraction, urban-versus-suburban development priorities, access and affordability. But any attempt to envision America\u2019s communities of the future needs to expand beyond these narrow objectives and begin with the more fundamental ideals that unite and ground American society. Communities that hope to flourish need to allow their residents to achieve the American Dream of upward mobility. They should also enable the expression of self determination, unity amid diversity and strong familial and communal life. More than abstractions, these ideals have practical consequences. For most, the American experiment is first experienced in the communities where they live, and their reasons for moving to, or staying within a community often have to do with how diversified and\u00a0robust the overall experience of opportunity is. The ideal community, I will argue, is both competitive and desirable. It capitalizes on its distinctive qualities to compete with other communities for people, investment, and jobs, and it also offers a level of life satisfaction that makes its residents think twice before leaving. Most importantly, it caters to diversity of preferences and allows for individual realization\u00a0of aspiration.

Essay New problems in small places By Richard E. Ocejo April 29, 2024 Scroll to Article Content Share Sixty Miles Upriver Available in 2 editions Buy This One of the many trends that made headlines during the Covid-19 pandemic was people moving from large, dense cities to smaller cities, towns, and even rural areas, bypassing the suburbs. This pattern had been happening prior to 2020, of course. It accelerated during the time of lockdowns and school and office closures. People with financial means and work flexibility are the most likely to make such a move. If working-from-home was going to be the new normal, why not avoid the big city\u2019s expensive real estate and get more space and access to nature, the thinking goes. Many in the middle class have picked up and left, while the wealthy are able to buy second homes, if they want, for lifestyle flexibility. The story of this pattern that has become most prominent since the pandemic is the fate of large cities. The \u201curban doom loop\u201d of declining downtowns and shrinking tax revenue take up a lot of oxygen. The places that don\u2019t get as much attention are the ones that have been receiving newcomers from large cities in noticeable numbers. Small municipalities and rural towns have faced the opposite issue from large cities: instead of the fear of decline, they are experiencing a sudden resurgence of new residents, businesses, development, and investment. In many cases, this influx has revived downtowns and Main Streets that were struggling for many decades. While these sound like positive additions at first glance, even success has consequences. It\u2019s almost paradoxical that places with small populations don\u2019t get much attention in the national media or in academic research, especially when compared to metropolises. Quite simply, there are a lot more small places than large ones. Out of the approximately 20,000 incorporated places in the",

Now, they\u2019re leaving big metro areas in droves and powering growth in small towns and rural areas. Since the pandemic, cities with more than 1 million residents have lost adults ages 25 to 44 while towns with smaller populations have gained young people, after accounting for both those moving in and leaving, according to a University of Virginia analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. \u201cYounger adults have driven most of the shift towards small towns and rural areas since the pandemic,\u201d said Hamilton Lombard, the study's author and a demographer at the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. It\u2019s no surprise that the health crisis fueled a migration of many Americans young and old to less populated areas with lower risk of contagion. But even as fears around COVID-19 have eased significantly, the endurance of the remote work shift sparked by the crisis and lower costs in smaller metro areas have continued to encourage young Americans to move to rural communities, Lombard said. \u201cThe migration of younger adults into small towns and rural areas picked up last year rather than returning to pre-pandemic trends,\u201d he said.

Understanding these demographics is crucial for tailoring effective support and intervention strategies for the homeless population. In major cities, urban areas tend to have higher concentrations of homeless individuals due to factors like job opportunities, access to social services, and affordable housing shortages. Conversely, small towns may experience lower overall numbers of homelessness but face challenges unique to their rural settings, such as limited resources and outreach programs. Demographic data also shed light on the prevalence of chronic homelessness, which refers to individuals experiencing long-term, persistent homelessness. This subgroup often requires specialized support services to address underlying issues contributing to their housing instability. Analyzing these demographics allows policymakers and service providers to allocate resources effectively and implement targeted interventions to address the diverse needs of homeless populations.

Faced with rising tuition costs, student loan debt, and an ever-competitive job market, finding affordable and stable housing is often a significant challenge for this demographic. This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted employment and housing stability for many young people. Thus, addressing the specific housing needs of young adults is more urgent than ever. Housing affordability directly impacts the opportunities available to young adults, influencing their ability to secure stable employment, pursue higher education, and build independent lives. Without affordable housing, these individuals may find themselves trapped in a cycle of instability, moving frequently, or even experiencing homelessness. Creating affordable housing options for young adults isn\u2019t just a matter of finance; it\u2019s a broader issue involving urban planning, community development, and policy making. Young adults require housing that is not only affordable but also conveniently located near education institutions, employment opportunities, and public transportation.

While Minneapolis and Saint Paul aren\u2019t on it, you can imagine that they\u2019d be somewhere in between Kansas City/Detroit and Seattle on this spectrum (given when most of the city was developed, and its economic growth since then, etc.). (For example, check out Milwaukee! It must be close enough to Chicago that far more duplexes were constructed there. And look at how much Philadelphia and Baltimore have in common, which totally makes sense if you think about it.) Things are changing, though, as Wonkblog says: As this chart shows, there are a lot of options between the traditional single-family home and the tower. And there are few cities in America \u2014 including those\u00a0with conspicuously rising housing costs \u2014 that don\u2019t have room in the mix for more of them. Seattle, for one, has been reassessing this summer all the land it has historically protected for\u00a0single-family homes\u00a0in an effort to create more affordable housing. Seattle has, in fact, a greater share of that kind of housing than Los Angeles. (This debate, though, is not going well, since political power in cities also tends to accrue to the left end of this housing spectrum.)

Their presence positively affects\u00a0city infrastructure,\u00a0local economies\u00a0and overall quality of life. Some people may wonder how this can be true when school districts within cities have to spend money on public schools. In fact, along with property tax payments, young families contribute to the economy by spending on housing, groceries, child care, health care, recreation and education. They create demand for family-oriented goods and services, which helps generate stable jobs in sectors such as education, health care, retail and hospitality.

The decisions made by urban planners impact not only the physical structure of cities but also the affordability of housing. With rapid urbanization and population growth, cities worldwide face significant challenges in providing affordable housing to their residents. This issue is especially prominent in large metropolitan areas where demand outstrips supply, driving up property prices and rental rates. To address these challenges, urban planning must incorporate strategies that promote housing affordability without compromising on the quality of life and sustainable development. In recent decades, the gap between income levels and housing costs has widened significantly, causing severe financial strain on middle and low-income families. This growing unaffordability raises questions about the efficacy of current urban planning practices and calls for a reevaluation of policies to make housing more accessible. The relationship between urban planning and housing affordability is multifaceted, involving zoning laws, land use regulations, funding mechanisms, and community engagement. By understanding and addressing these factors, planners can contribute to developing equitable and vibrant urban environments. This article explores the various ways in which urban planning affects housing affordability. It delves into the role of zoning and land use regulations, the impact of transportation and infrastructure development, the importance of mixed-use developments, and the necessity for inclusive and community-oriented planning. Through these lenses, we can better understand how deliberate and thoughtful urban planning can help solve the housing affordability crisis and create cities that are livable for all residents.

Smarter Land Use: Helping Cities Attract Young Adults \u00a0\u00a0Here's the nutshell:\u00a0 20th-century land use won't help your city attract and retain 21st-century people.\u00a0 It just won't. This is because the lifestyle values of the Millennial generation, sometimes called GenY, are markedly different from those of previous generations when they were the same age as the Millennials are now (roughly 18 to 34). The prolific urban observer Richard Florida has been telling us this in various ways for years, as he researches and charts the shifting economic geography of the US. He believes the housing and finance industry collapse of the last few years signals the end of one economic era and the beginning of another, though I'm sure he would be the first to tell us that we're in a messy and hard-to-pin-down transition.\u00a0 But he is clear that the new economy \u2013 based less on manufacturing and established institutions, more on creativity, entrepreneurship, connectedness and interaction \u2013 will prosper best in places suited to a new kind of lifestyle, one that has already emerged in leading cities. In his book The Great Reset, Rich puts it this way: \"Every major economic era gives rise to a new, distinctive geography of its own. This Great Reset will likewise take shape around a new economic landscape and a whole new way of life that is in line with the emerging economic and social realities of our time . . . \"One thing is certain: this emerging new way of life, which some already refer to as an impending 'new normal,' will be less oriented around cars, houses, and suburbs.\" I've been mulling this for a couple of weeks, since I ran across an excellent report written in 2009 by Jonathan Rose Companies and Wallace Roberts Todd for the Hartford metropolitan planning organization (the report was supported, like the Greening America's Capitals study, by the federal EPA). \u00a0Reading it, I was surprised to learn ",

Giant open spaces, exposed brick, large windows overlooking busy streets. What was once the purview of Brooklyn and SoHo is now a popular style of apartment found in cities around the country. Some are still old warehouses and industrial buildings, but many are new and purpose-built as well. What is a loft apartment? In general, a loft is usually a top-floor (or high floor) unit organized as one large, open space. Typically there is no separation between living and dining areas, and often not between bedroom areas either. In their open spaces, most lofts feature exposed designs like brick, pipes, ventilation and structural beams. Also, expect 10-to-20 foot high ceilings, a limited number of walls, open kitchens and floor-to-ceiling windows. This architecture is what gives lofts their industrial, modern and edgy feel. Technically, most loft apartments classify as studio apartments as they are normally one large space without separate sleeping rooms. Loft apartments are often twice the size of a standard studio \u2014 typically around 1,000 square feet. Historically, loft apartments reclaim converted warehouses and industrial buildings in dense urban areas above commercial spaces. Such units were originally preferred by artists, hipsters and young urban professionals. But today, lofts are a great cool space for anyone willing to pay the (often higher) price. In fact, this increase in popularity has required a split in loft apartment categories. True lofts, known as \"hard lofts,\" are actual conversions of industrial spaces. Conversely, newer apartments built to mimic the style and vibe of traditional lofts are known as \u201csoft lofts.\" Finding the cities with the most loft apartment layouts So if you're interested and looking for a loft-style floorplan for your next apartment, what are the best cities to search for?

Shared housing was common for most of American history, but it declined sharply over the past 70 years as local zoning codes became more restrictive. In 2024, the list of states seeking to reverse that trend grew by three as Colorado, Hawaii, and Washington passed legislation to enable shared housing. Hawaii and Washington passed legislation requiring local governments to allow microunits, a low-cost housing arrangement\u2014with much lower rents than studio apartments\u2014in which residents have private rooms but share bathrooms, kitchens, and common living areas, similar to college dorms or some senior living facilities. These states join Oregon, which passed a similar law in 2023. Colorado, meanwhile, passed a \u201cGolden Girls\u201d law\u2014a reform named for the four women who lived together in the classic TV show\u2014that removes local caps on how many unrelated people can share a home. With this legislation, the state became the third in the nation, after Iowa in 2017 and Oregon in 2021, to loosen shared housing restrictions. Although the Hawaii and Washington approaches differ from Colorado\u2019s, both are designed to allow less-expensive ways of living. Microunits Hawaii, Oregon, and Washington\u2019s microunit laws reflect a recognition of a key fact that research has increasingly shown: States and localities that have substantially increased their housing supply have slowed rent growth and cut homelessness, and allowing microunits can help address the shortage of affordable rental options.

Public transportation, which individuals use daily for work, education, health, and social needs, is becoming increasingly important. As cities grow, populations increase, and roads become more crowded, both individual vehicle and public transportation usage are rising. In this context, the preference for public transportation over individual vehicles plays a critical role for cities. When public transport is encouraged, cities improve environmentally, economically, socially, and in terms of quality of life. With this development, a step is taken each day toward a more sustainable future. In this article, we will explore the benefits that public transportation offers both individuals and cities. Perhaps, on your next journey, you will think about how beneficial public transport is and how much of a difference it can make. Environmental Benefits Today, rapidly increasing air pollution in cities is one of the biggest threats to public health. In this context, public transportation, compared to individual vehicles, plays an effective role in combating air pollution as a more environmentally friendly alternative. Whether for work or leisure, the decisions we make about how to get from one place to another have a huge impact on carbon emissions. Public transport vehicles produce approximately 33% fewer emissions than a single-occupancy car passenger. Since public transport vehicles have lower carbon emissions, they improve air quality in cities, offering a cleaner environment. Choosing public transport over other modes of transport can have a significant impact on reducing carbon emissions. Not only does the choice of public transport prevent air pollution, but it also helps achieve energy efficiency. When public transport vehicles are filled to capacity, energy consumption per person decreases significantly. For instance, when a bus operates at full capacity, energy consumption per person can drop b",

Congestion reduction also benefits businesses and city infrastructure by allowing goods and services to move more quickly through urban areas. Reduced congestion can save cities and individuals millions in lost productivity each year, which can be redirected into community improvement projects, enhancing the overall quality of life for residents. 2. Lowers Carbon Emissions and Pollution Public transportation significantly reduces air pollution by limiting the number of single-passenger vehicles on the road. Buses, trains, and other public transit options use less fuel per person compared to private vehicles, which results in lower greenhouse gas emissions. Public transportation also decreases pollutants such as carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides, which contribute to respiratory problems and environmental degradation. Reducing air pollution improves air quality and decreases the risks associated with pollution-r",

This means that it provides easy access to employment opportunities, education facilities, health care services, groceries stores or markets, entertainment places etc. Moreover public transportation allows people to walk or bike from their residences to these destinations instead of having to drive or use motorized transport for short distances which is not only time-consuming but also costly. Public transport systems are affordable modes of travel that provide alternative routes for commuters who live away from public transit stops and who cannot afford owning their own vehicle for example students living on campus of colleges and universities with no dorm What is Public Transportation and Why is it Important? Public transportation is a system of transport which provides passengers with an alternative to private car ownership. It includes buses, trains, trams, and other passenger vehicles such as light rail and ferry boats. Public transportation is important because it allows people with different physical abilities to access various destinations like schools, jobs or shopping centers. It also helps cut down air pollution by letting people commute in a carpool or use public transport instead of driving their own cars.

As cities strive to become smarter and more sustainable, they\u2019re embracing cutting-edge solutions like electric vehicles and intelligent traffic management systems to tackle congestion, pollution, and accessibility issues. The future of urban mobility holds exciting possibilities for creating more livable and efficient cities. From the rise of shared mobility services to the integration of autonomous vehicles, innovative transportation solutions are poised to transform urban landscapes. This article delves into the key challenges facing modern cities in terms of transportation, explores groundbreaking solutions being implemented globally, and examines the crucial role of policy and governance in shaping sustainable urban transport systems. By understanding these developments, we can gain valuable insights into the future of city living and mobility. The Evolution of Urban Mobility Historical Perspective: Urban mobility has undergone a remarkable transformation over the centuries. In pre-industrial times, cities were compact with mixed-use structures, as movement was primarily restricted to walking. This inefficient and time-consuming mode of transport led to the agglomeration of activity nodes. As transport technology advanced, it brought about significant changes in urban form. The more radical the changes in transport technology, the more substantial the alterations in urban structure. Current Trends: Today, urban mobility is experiencing rapid evolution, driven by technological advancements and changing societal needs.

UWE and Sustrans have just published a report which reveals how young people in England and Wales use and experience the transport system and the barriers that exist for meeting their travel needs. It is the culmination of a three-year project called Transport to Thrive which aimed to make the policy case for transport that better enables young people aged 16-24 to make journeys and reach opportunities that help them to thrive. The project was funded by the Health Foundation as part of its Young people\u2019s future health inquiry. Our report presents new analyses of national travel data, combined with insights from in-depth interviews with young people leaving school and college. We found young people aged 16-24 make 14% fewer trips compared to the population average and 21% fewer trips compared to working age adults of 25-64 years.

Some of us regularly spend 40 minutes every day just getting back and forth between work. Others seem to become road warriors and spend three hours a day just getting to and from an office or job site. Meanwhile, others still may get to take a train or bus, and spend way less money but probably more time to reach their destination. But with all this movement going on, what is the true cost of commuting? The Cost of Commuting So what does it cost to commute? The cost of commuting is primarily dependent upon the mode of transportation. Of course, it also depends on how far you have to go, but some things are far more cost-efficient than others. For example, driving yourself costs a lot more than taking public transportation (ideally). But, as you probably already know, what you pay for in dollars you trade for in time \u2014 if your city even has efficient, reliable and robust public transportation. In America, because of the way cities and towns have been primarily planned and designed, cars are often the fastest form of transportation between any two points. If you were to take a bus, it would probably be cheaper, but only get you sort of close to your destination. Plus, it could take twice or three times as long. So, most often whatever is the cheapest way to commute is often the costliest in time. Luckily, you can probably figure out a dollar-to-dollar significance of how much time it takes you to commute.

From cost-effectiveness to environmental impact and time management \u2013 let's delve deep into the nitty-gritty details and help you decide which option works best for you! Owning a Vehicle Assuming you don't have a car and are trying to decide if it's the right time to buy one, there are a few things you should take into consideration. The average new car now costs around $30,000, and the average used car is about half that. When it comes to ownership costs, fuel will be your biggest ongoing expense. The national average for gas is currently $2.58 per gallon. Depending on the type of car you get, its fuel efficiency, and how much you drive, it'll cost a few hundred to over a thousand dollars in fuel costs per month. In addition to gas, other normal maintenance expenses like insurance, regular oil changes, and tire alignment/rotations may add up to hundreds of dollars a year. Finally, there are other one-time ownership costs that should be budgeted into your car purchase, such as registration fees, taxes, and possibly even repairs if you buy an older used vehicle. Overall owning a vehicle is an expensive commitment but can bring value by providing convenience and transportation that public transportation or other methods cannot.

Cars vs public transportation is an increasingly important debate as cities grow and concerns over the environment and personal budgets come into focus. Whether you live in a busy city or a quiet suburb, deciding between owning a car or using public transit isn\u2019t just about convenience\u2014it\u2019s about how your choice affects your wallet, health, and the planet. With growing congestion in urban areas and limited public transit in rural zones, understanding the pros and cons of each option is essential for making informed decisions. From the flexibility of driving your car to the affordability and eco-friendly benefits of public transportation, each mode of travel offers unique advantages. Do you prioritize the independence of driving, or prefer the cost-effective and sustainable benefits of buses and trains? In this post, we\u2019ll break down the key differences between cars vs public transit, helping you make the best choice for your commute or travel. Convenience and Flexibility: Cars vs Public Transportation When it comes to convenience and flexibility, the cars vs public transportation debate heavily depends on where you live and your schedule. Cars are often seen as the epitome of convenience. Having your car means that you can go anywhere, anytime, without being restricted by bus or train schedules. Whether you live in a suburban area of the USA or a rural village in the UK, cars provide unparalleled flexibility. This is particularly true in areas where public transportation is limited, irregular, or non-existent. Public transportation shines in cities with well-connected transit systems. Urban centers like New York, London, and Los Angeles have intricate networks of buses, subways, and trains that make getting around both affordable and straightforward.

When it comes to transportation options, one of the biggest decisions many people make is whether to drive or take public transportation. While driving a car offers freedom and convenience, public transportation can be a more budget-friendly option. In this article, we\u2019ll take a closer look at the costs associated with each mode of transportation to determine which one is more cost-effective. The True Cost of Owning and Operating a Car Before we dive into the costs associated with public transportation, it\u2019s important to understand the true cost of owning and operating a car. This includes not only the purchase price of the vehicle, but also ongoing expenses such as insurance, maintenance, repairs, and gas. According to AAA, the average cost of owning and operating a new car is roughly $9,282 per year. This breaks down to approximately $773 per month. Keep in mind that this figure can vary widely depending on the make and model of your car, as well as the cost of gas in your area. Comparing Public Transportation Costs Now that we have a better understanding of the true cost of owning a car, let\u2019s take a look at the cost of public transportation. The cost of public transportation can vary widely depending on where you live and how often you use it. In general, however, taking public transportation is significantly cheaper than owning and operating a car. For example, the average cost of a bus or subway ride in the United States is around $2.50. If you use public transportation to commute to work five days a week, that translates to a monthly cost of $100. Of course, there are other factors to consider, such as the cost of parking if you\u2019re driving to a public transportation station, as well as the potential for fare increases. However, in most cases, taking public transportation is still far more cost-effective than owning a car.

Brown, Evelyn Blumenberg, and Brian D. Taylor UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs Kelcie Ralph Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy, Rutgers University Carole Turley Voulgaris UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs Abstract In the past decade, there has been much talk about a decline in driving among youth. This study examined whether this decline is associated with an increased reliance on public transit. To address this issue, 2001 and 2009 National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data were used to analyze the relationship between age and transit use. Findings indicate that although young adults are more likely to ride transit than older adults, transit use among youth can be explained largely by (1) life cycle factors common among young people but unlikely to persist as they age, (2) higher levels of transit use among non-whites, who are disproportionately young, and (3) locational factors such as living in densely-developed neighborhoods that may or may not continue as young people age. Therefore, whereas transit habits established early in life may persist as young adults age, the data examined here suggest that such an outcome is far from assured. Keywords: Millennials, transit use, travel behavior Introduction Over the past decade, there has been much talk about a decline in auto travel among youth. Per-capita driving in the U.S. has dipped, with higher than average declines among teens and young adults (or Millennials, those born between 1980 and 2004), prompting some observers to conclude that youth are \u201cditching\u201d cars for a more multimodal lifestyle that includes a greater reliance on public transit among other non-auto modes (Ball 2014; Blumenberg et al. 2012; Davis, Dutzik, and Baxandall 2012; Malcolm 2014; McDonald 2015).

Understanding young people\u2019s experiences in urban environments is therefore important as we strive to achieve both the Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement. Two amenities identified in the urban Sustainable Development Goal 11, transport and public and green space, are specifically recognised as applying to youth. Yet, there is little analysis that explicitly considers how youth experience these amenities across the Global North and South, and no current measures for understanding progress in youth experiences of green space and transport. Results This paper provides a comparative analysis of young people\u2019s experiences with local transport and green space in seven diverse urban communities (Christchurch, New Zealand; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Lambeth/London, UK; Makhanda, South Africa; New Delhi, India; S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; and Yokohama, Japan). Our study contributes to a growing body of literature that seeks to listen to child and youth perspectives to understand their environmental experiences. We examine the \u2018affordances\u2019 young residents aged 12 to 24\u2009years currently associate with green space and transport amenities. Affordances are defined here as the inter-relationships between what a local environment offers young people and their perceptions and actions. Drawing on focus groups and interviews conducted with 332 young people, we identify five affordances young people associate in relation to transport and public space across these diverse urban settings: (1) social inclusion and belonging; (2) autonomy; (3) physical comfort and security; (4) r",

Using detailed GPS location data, we measure the urban mobility and experienced racial and economic isolation of the young and the disadvantaged. We find that students in major metropolitan areas experience more racial and income isolation, spend more time at home, stay closer to home when they do leave, and visit fewer restaurants and retail establishments than adults. Looking across levels of income, students from higher-income families visit more amenities, spend more time outside of the home, and explore more unique locations than low-income students. Combining a number of measures into an index of urban mobility, we find that, conditional on income, urban mobility is positively correlated with home neighborhood characteristics such as distance from the urban core, car ownership and social capital.

Social inclusion is about ensuring that all people are able to take part in society and access opportunities regardless of their background or specific characteristics (e.g. gender, race, income, geography). Designing socially inclusive policies and services involves removing barriers to participation, ideally informed by the lived experiences of different groups. There are often considerable overlaps in the challenges that marginalised groups face and designing for those groups tends to ultimately result in a better policies and services for all users. However, across a wide range of policy areas, not least transport policy, there has been a tendency to design around what has been termed the \u2018reference man\u2019 or \u2018default male\u2019 \u2013 that is a young, healthy, financially secure male. Whilst often not intentional, this has had the effect of marginalising the experiences and needs of other groups, not least those of women, who comprise half the UK population. What are the connections between transport and social inclusion? Transport is intrinsically linked to our ability to live a full and healthy life. The transport choices we make (or are able to make) affect the extent to which we as individuals are able to participate fully in society. Those choices also affect the ability of others to live a good life \u2013 from the local right through to the global scale. For example, being able to choose to walk or cycle a journey has benefits for both the individual and for wider society. As individuals it means we can access opportunities to work, care for others, shop, go to school or visit friends. It also supports our physical and mental health and wellbeing, making it more likely we can carry on doing the things we enjoy for longer. The benefits also ripple outwards to wider society. Being able to access employment, education, shops and services \u2013 as well as to fulfil caring responsibilities - brings economic benefits for society. Furthermore, the health benefits of walkin",

Young people, who have always been at the forefront of cultural and social change, will play an essential role in the success of this work. From MTV News to March for Our Lives, teens shape the way we recreate, communicate, and stand up for our rights. Young people are also changing transportation culture, with fewer teens driving and more teens using public transportation and active transportation. Yet, motor vehicle collisions are still a leading cause of death for teens; this presents a critical opportunity to reduce injury and death rates in this age group. The Safe Routes for Youth project aimed to address these trends and develop youth-centered Vision Zero strategies. The Safe Routes Partnership worked with young people in Washington, DC to drive a set of innovative transportation safety initiatives. The goals of Safe Routes for Youth project were to engage directly with young people to support youth leadership and identify barriers to safe transportation, prioritize and design strategies that increase safe transportation for young people, conduct youth-led safety education initiatives, and build District understanding around transportation issues affecting youth.",

It\u2019s Wednesday, May 18. I\u2019m Justin Ray. I have a secret. There\u2019s something I try not to discuss when in casual conversation with other residents of Los Angeles, a city known for its lengthy commute times and conversations about roads so infamous that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d (among others) parodied them. The truth is, I don\u2019t own a car. Why? Because I don\u2019t want one. I lived in New York City for seven years and, before that, Chicago for four. During that time, I got around with public transit, as do many other residents of those cities. Sure, people who take the bus or the train are causing less emissions. But that\u2019s not why I don\u2019t have a car. My main reason is because I don\u2019t want to deal with fines, parking, fender benders and the other nonsense that makes car ownership a chore. Paying astronomical rent, putting out a daily newsletter and dating men is hard enough as it is. When I came to California, I discovered that public transit isn\u2019t one of its strengths. Many of the state\u2019s biggest cities have failed to make their train systems connect to the local airport. There\u2019s also the ongoing drama around the California bullet train, which \u2014 despite all its hype and cost \u2014 has yet to be completed. But I want to talk about another transit issue: bad behavior on trains. I have been in the city for 3\u00bd years and I have seen everything: people getting jumped; arguments among passengers; a guy getting his phone stolen out of his hands; people smoking cigarettes and meth; a couple on a bus in Hollywood rolling up a dollar bill and doing cocaine off of a book. You name it, I\u2019ve seen it. I have experienced some wild circumstances. I remember riding a bus in Los Feliz and looking down at some item on the seat next to me. It turned out to be a pretty hefty blunt. Although I had a good laugh about it, not all of my experiences have been funny. I have been called the F-slur while waiti",

The travel time, waiting time, or the comfort level they will experience inside the vehicle are some of the most important reliability attributes. Reliability is usually neglected from travel behavioural models, since there is a lack of studies addressing its impact in travellers\u2019 choices. This study proposes an in-depth analysis and characterization of travel time reliability in a public transport system using passive data only, which every day is getting more popular worldwide. The study is comprised of two parts, taking Transantiago (the public transport system of Santiago, Chile) as a study case, as it is a good representation of a frequency-based public transport system. In the first part a statistical and graphical analysis of travel times is conducted, focusing on characterizing headway and travel time reliability of public transport services as well as the effect of dedicated infrastructure, based on smartcard transactions and GPS information. In the second part an aggregate mode choice model based on revealed data is developed to analyse the effect of travel time reliability on travellers\u2019 preferences. Overall, this study provides evidence of significant differences among headway variability and in-vehicle travel time dispersion different public transport modes. The standard deviation (a measure of dispersion) can be quite high for bus trips, while in the case of metro is smaller than 4\u00a0min independent of trip length. Regarding the aggregate public transport mode choice model, the coefficient of variation of headways is a key attribute to explain modal preferences. It was found that average bus users would accept traveling ~\u20095\u00a0min longer to completely avoid headway irregularity. All these results were obtained by ",

While there are many reviews regarding travellers\u2019 preferences and travel mode choices, there is a lack of an updated review that provides a comprehensive overview of the factors that make public transport systems attractive. Aim This review aims to fill the knowledge gap by offering insights into the factors influencing travel behaviour and the demand for public transport. It has two primary objectives: \u2022 Summarize general conclusions drawn from international literature reviews. \u2022 Present specific insights on the topic pertaining to the Nordic countries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review with a Nordic focus regarding public transport preferences and travel mode choices. The special focus on these countries is motivated by their relatively more ambitious policies for reducing emissions in the transport sector compared to many other countries, and their relatively high usage of public transport today. Methods To achieve these objectives, we conducted a review of existing literature. This review encompassed international literature reviews and included an examination of results from the Nordic countries. Findings The findings show that reliability and frequency are important factors for creating an attractive public transport supply. However, there is only limited evidence regarding the impact of improvements in these attributes on public transport demand, so this needs more research. This review highlights the importance of understanding the underlying motivations for travel mode choice and provides recommendations on areas for further investigation to understand the attractiveness of ",

Survey Says It's Frequency, Reliability and Shorter Travel Times Riders value frequent service more than almost anything else. Wi-fi at bus stops? Not so much. Riders value frequent service more than almost anything else. Wi-fi at bus stops? Not so much. Why are some public transportation routes and systems successful while others aren't? A new study by the advocacy group TransitCenter seeks to answer that question, based on the responses of thousands of passengers. It may seem like an easy question, but often it's one that roils even the best-made transit plans. Take, for example, Seattle's three-mile light rail extension. Its ridership has increased from 35,000 to 57,000 per day. On the other hand, Atlanta\u2019s new downtown streetcar only attracts roughly 1,000 riders per day, roughly one-sixth the projected ridership. The survey sought to explain, in part, why not all transit is created equal in the minds of users. A well-used transit system depends largely on the walkability of its nearby urban infrastructure and the frequency and reliability of its service, according to the survey's findings. Things like wi-fi and extra power outlets -- sometimes touted as important amenities by transit agencies -- were among the least important improvements to riders. Station quality, real-time tracking and reduced travel times ranked higher. The findings were published in the TransitCenter's report issued Tuesday, based on survey responses from some 3,000 individuals from 17 metropolitan areas across the country. It follows a similar 2014 survey. The chart below shows how riders would value hypothetical service improvements. Article continues below chart. Underscoring the importance of walkability, the survey found that 80 percent of so-called all-purpose riders (people who use public transportation for a variety of needs) and slightly more than 50 percent of commuters and occasional riders walk to public transportation.

As one UC Berkeley Y-PLAN Sacramento teacher posed: \u201cWho better to ask about public transit than kids who take the bus?\u201d This chapter begins with a literature review exploring how youth engagement in transportation planning is integral to child and youth-friendly city planning by providing access to opportunity, fostering independence and identity formation, and driving or impeding equity. Through in-depth case studies that forge intergenerational communities of practice, young planners from the \u201cBrighten Broadway\u201d project in Brooklyn, New York City to the African American Male Achievement Initiative in Oakland, California share their visions for safe, reliable, and equitable transportation. To young planners, transportation policy has the potential to bring people together by fostering shared use of public space, encouraging transit-oriented development, and replacing armed security agents with \u201cCommunity Protectors\u201d equipped with local knowledge, understanding, and awareness. They call for transportation networks to be equitably safe and accessible, with improved technologies to fluidly connect public spaces while fostering community and independence, all essential for planning just and joyful cities.

Thus, effective solutions to address the negative impacts that come with rising car-ownership are needed as part of an overall travel demand management strategy. In developed and emerging economies, shared-mobility in the form of car-sharing is becoming popular as potentially low-cost and environmentally sustainable alternative to car-ownership. Yet, our understanding of car-sharing adoption and diffusion factors in developing countries is limited. In this study, we fill this gap by examining car-sharing adoption intentions among young adults aged between 18 and 35\u00a0years in Ghana, Sub-Saharan Africa. Using structural equation modelling, we model car-sharing adoption intentions based on a framework that integrates individuals\u2019 perception of the benefits of car-sharing, attitudes towards the environment and technology, trust of stewardship in car-sharing, perception of innovativeness of car-sharing, travel expectations and socio-demographic factors.

Yet, few studies define and research sustainable food consumption, particularly in understanding socioeconomic and environmental challenges and opportunities in urban environments. This paper evaluates 500 online surveys conducted in Brisbane, Australia, to explore public perceptions of food consumption and the underlying challenges and opportunities. A key finding is the co-existence of over- and underconsumption prevailing over the traditional focus on unhealthy food overconsumption. The challenges of affordability, access to healthy foods, limited retail options, and increasing carbon urban footprints complicate food consumption as a demand issue more conditional to the socio-spatial characteristics of urban environments. Opportunities for sustainable food consumption also arise in high health awareness and willingness to change dietary habits if facilitated by improved urban food provisioning. We argue that food diversity and accessibility-conducive urban environments can help transform food consumption by enabling enhanced access to affordable and nutritious foods, diversified food retail options and variety, and reduced food waste and loss-associated carbon emissions. To do so means improved global equity in food consumption and carbon footprint can optim",

Joseph / UBC Brand & Marketing How does food promote diversity and inclusivity? Food serves not only as a means of nourishment but also as a way for individuals to engage with and better understand various cultures and communities. Food has the remarkable ability to bring people together and create a sense of connection. It offers a unique opportunity to learn about different cultures and broaden our understanding of the world. By exploring diverse cuisines, we can gain insights into various societies\u2019 history, traditions, and social structures. For instance, analyzing the ways in which food is prepared and consumed can reveal significant information about gender roles and power dynamics in a given community.

This review focuses mainly on the spatial approach of the foodscape, i.e. all the local shops, markets, restaurants and sales outlets that provide food supplies in a given area. This review aims to explore the evidence on relationships of urban foodscape with diet and health outcomes and to highlight the limitations in studying these relationships as well as suggestions for future studies. Many systematic reviews on characteristics of the foodscape in relation to weight status outcomes emerged over the last decade and results are equivocal. There is not a direct association between the foodscape and weight status of the individual, rather any association is a distant one. Therefore, it is more appropriate to focus on associations between foodscape and intermediate, more proximal outcomes, such as dietary behaviours. Research on the role of the foodscape in promoting or hindering healthy dietary behaviours are also numerous, and results are again mixed. The diversity of methodologies might partly explain the heterogeneity of these results. Focusing on overall diet quality rather than fruit and vegetable consumption, taking into account multiple characteristics of the foodscape, as well as socioeconomic and contextual differences, might be part of the solution for more consistent results. Consequently, results of such studies could help shape foodscapes, which present a great opportunity for promoting healthier and eventually more sustainable diet",

The conceptual model combines the basic elements of the heritage city, the smart city and the creative city. The city is interpreted from a threefold perspective; as a repository of resources, as a connective interface, and as the setting for citizens' life and social and professional experiences. In this context, each of these perspectives incorporates culture in a different way, enabling different models of value creation and different processes of production and reproduction of this value. In each of the urban models described above, production processes that combine symbolic, physical, financial, social, human and cultural capital in different ways and urban strategies are implemented to provide cultural experiences that ignite transformative effects through several spillovers. That means that culture, in its different dimensions, regains the role of a raw material and becomes the point of origin to activate development processes and improve urban performance.

It provides a window into the histories, traditions, and values of diverse societies. Exploring global cuisines allows us to appreciate the rich stories embedded in dishes, from preparation methods to the rituals surrounding consumption. These practices can also shed light on societal structures, including insights into gender roles and power dynamics, offering a deeper understanding of the world and its communities. How have food and culinary arts played a role in shaping cultures? Since ancient times, food has been a vital part of cultures across the globe, uniting people through its necessity and universality. To sustain our calorie-hungry brains, early humans mastered fire and cooking, transforming raw ingredients into flavorful, digestible meals. This cultural innovation of adding flavor, spices, and techniques not only improved survival outcomes through increased nutritional value, but also influenced human evolution, leading to smaller teeth, weaker chewing muscles, and shorter digestive tracts compared to our primate relatives. Food\u2019s role in shaping humanity is highlighted in our very biology.\u00a0 \u201cThere is more to eating than survival. Eating and drinking are a medium through which we gather, socialize, and create bonds.

It not only sustains us physically but also plays a significant role in shaping our cultural identity. The way we prepare, consume, and share food reflects our traditions, values, and beliefs. In this article, we will explore the influence of food on cultural identity and how cuisine can bridge the gaps between different cultures. Cultural identity is a complex concept that encompasses various aspects of our lives, including language, customs, and traditions. Food, being a universal necessity, is an essential component of cultural identity. Different regions and countries have their unique culinary traditions, which are passed down through generations. These traditions not only define a particular culture but also provide a sense of belonging and pride. When people from different cultures come together, food becomes a powerful tool for cultural exchange. It allows individuals to share their culinary traditions, learn about new flavors, and appreciate the diversity of cuisines. Through food, we can experience different cultures without leaving our own communities. It opens up a world of flavors and aromas, creating a sense of unity and understanding. One example of how food bridges cultural gaps is the popularity of ethnic restaurants. These establishments offer a taste of different cultures, allowing people to explore new cuisines and experience the traditions associated with them. Whether it's a Mexican taqueria, an Indian curry house, or a Japanese sushi bar, these restaurants provide a platform for cultural exchange.

Login Alert Article contents Global cities and cultural diversity: challenges and opportunities for young people's nutrition Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 27 September 2018 Abstract Childhood obesity is a common concern across global cities and threatens sustainable urban development. Initiatives to improve nutrition and encourage physical exercise are promising but are yet to exert significant influence on prevention. Childhood obesity in London is associated with distinct ethnic and socio-economic patterns. Ethnic inequalities in health-related behaviour endure, underpinned by inequalities in employment, housing, access to welfare services, and discrimination. Addressing these growing concerns requires a clearer understanding of the socio-cultural, environmental and economic contexts of urban living that promote obesity. We explore opportunities for prevention using asset based-approaches to nutritional health and well-being, with a particular focus on adolescents from diverse ethnic backgrounds living in London. We focus on the important role that community engagement and multi-sectoral partnership play in improving the nutritional outcomes of London's children. London's children and adolescents grow up in the rich cultural mix of a global city where local streets are characterised by diversity in ethnicities, languages, religions, foods, and customs, creating complex and fluid identities. Growing up with such everyday diversity we argue can enhance the quality of life for London's children and strengthen their social capital.

Across cultures and throughout history, the act of sharing a meal has been a way to foster connections, build relationships, and promote inclusivity. In today\u2019s increasingly diverse world, the cultural significance of food in promoting inclusivity cannot be overstated. Food is a universal language that transcends barriers of language, race, and religion. It is a tangible expression of culture, and by sharing our culinary traditions, we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for one another. When we sit down at a table and share a meal, we are not just nourishing our bodies; we are nourishing our souls and forging connections with those around us. One of the most beautiful aspects of food is its ability to tell a story. Each dish carries with it a rich history and a unique set of traditions. By exploring the culinary traditions of different cultures, we can gain insight into their values, beliefs, and way of life. Food becomes a gateway to understanding and appreciating the diversity of our world. Inclusivity is about more than just tolerance; it is about actively seeking out and embracing different perspectives and experiences. Food provides a tangible way to do this. By seeking out and trying new cuisines, we can expand our horizons and challenge our preconceived notions. We can break down stereotypes and build bridges between cultures. Food also has the power to create a sense of belonging. In a world that can often feel divided, the act of coming together to share a meal can create a sense of unity and community. Whether it\u2019s a potluck dinner, a neighborhood barbecue, or a cultural food festival, food has the ability to bring people from all walks of life together in a shared",

The truth is, there are positive and negative aspects to both kinds of living. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2016, the median household income in rural communities was 4% lower than that of urban communities. However, roughly 3% more families in urban areas were living under the poverty line. The cost of living, earnings potential, and lifestyle differences all combine to make each lifestyle different. Before you decide to buy a farm in the country or get an apartment in Manhattan, it\u2019s essential to understand the pros and cons of both lifestyles. Advantages of urban living While urban living does get a certain amount of negative attention for its high price tag, it also comes with opportunities and amenities that rural living cannot offer. Urban living offers more options for employment, entertainment, and transportation, and many people feel these positives far outweigh the disadvantages. Earnings potential According to Bloomberg, urban areas (both large and small) consistently report earnings higher than the national average. Residents can find higher-paying jobs in urban areas than in rural areas, which leads to higher net worth. There is also a wider range of job opportunities for workers. Urban areas have long lists of businesses. A rural area will have a more limited list of open job opportunities, and thus a limited amount of earning potential for residents. Entertainment Urban areas have a variety of entertainment options. From restaurants and bars to music venues and community events, urban areas have fun activities for everyone. If you\u2019re on a budget, urban areas also offer free or low-cost entertainment opportunities. These include: Taking advantage of low-cost entertainment can help residents stick to their budgets, and avoid credit card debt while living in a high-cost area. It",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Globally, the number of minority ethnic groups in high-income countries is increasing. However, despite this demographic change, most national food consumption surveys are not representative of ethnically diverse populations. In consequence, many ethnic minorities\u2019 dietary intakes are underreported, meaning that accurate analysis of food intake and nutrient status among these groups is not possible. This systematic review aims to address these gaps and understand differences in dietary intakes and influencers of dietary habits of ethnic groups worldwide. A systematic search was conducted through three databases (Pubmed, Web of Science and Scopus) and manual searches, generating n = 56,647 results. A final search of these databases was completed on 13 September 2021, resulting in a total of 49 studies being included in this review. Overall, food group intakes\u2014particularly fruit, vegetable and fish intake\u2014and diet quality scores were seen to differ between ethnicities. Overall Black/African American groups were reported to be among the poorest consumers of fruit and vegetables, whilst Asian groups achieved high diet q",

Racial and Ethnic Diversification Will Likely Shape U.S. Food Demand and Diet Quality Highlights: U.S. demographic trends, including increased diversity brought about by immigration, may cause overall consumer demand for some types of foods to grow faster than demand for others. U.S. immigrants generally acculturate in their food choices, adopting eating patterns more like native-born people of their same ethnic and racial group. Non-Hispanic Asians may have slightly higher quality diets, on average, than other racial and ethnic groups. The number of people who call the United States home continues to grow. Results from the most recent decennial census show that the U.S. population increased from about 309 million people in 2010 to about 331 million in 2020. Projections released by the U.S. Census Bureau put the United States on track to reach more than 400 million inhabitants by 2060. Foreign-born residents are forecast to account for about 17 percent of the total U.S. population in 2060, up from 14 percent in 2020. Native-born residents, including children of immigrants, are expected to account for 83 percent. According to projections, as immigrants arrive from Asia and Latin America, the United States will grow more racially and ethnically diverse. Between 2020 and 2060, the Census Bureau predicts that individuals of Hispanic origin will grow from 19 percent to 29 percent of the total population. Non-Hispanic Blacks are forecast to rise from 12 percent to 13 percent. Non-Hispanic Asians are predicted to increase from 6 percent to 9 percent. And non-Hispanic Whites are predicted to decrease from 57 percent to 44 percent of the total population. T",

In this article: The Influence of Cultural Globalization on Food **Cultural Exchange:** Cultural globalization has facilitated the exchange of culinary traditions, ingredients, and cooking techniques among different cultures. Through migration, travel, and international trade, cultures have borrowed, incorporated, and blended ingredients and culinary practices from various regions. **Fusion Cuisine:** Cultural globalization has given rise to a phenomenon known as fusion cuisine. Chefs and home cooks have begun fusing ingredients and cooking styles from different cultures, creating unique and exciting flavor combinations. **Availability of International Ingredients:** Cultural globalization has expanded the availability of international ingredients. Supermarkets now stock a wide range of ingredients from different corners of the globe, allowing people to experiment with diverse flavors, spices, and ingredients that were previously difficult to access. **Globalized Food Chains:** The rise of globalized fast-food chains has significantly influenced food consumption patterns. Their standardized menus have become a common sight in many countries, giving people a taste of international cuisine.

Please keep reading. **How does culture affect food choices?** Culture significantly influences food choices in multiple aspects. From shaping dietary habits to defining culinary traditions, culture plays a fundamental role in what we eat. It influences our taste preferences, ingredient preferences, cooking methods, and mealtime rituals. Cultural factors like geographic location, climate, religion, and historical events shape the availability of different ingredients and cooking techniques, thus influencing food choices. For example, cultures from coastal regions tend to have a greater emphasis on seafood in their diet, while cultures from colder climates may rely more on hearty and warming dishes. Moreover, our cultural background instills in us certain food preferences and aversions from a young age. These preferences are often tied to our personal and collective memories, nostalgia, and emotional associations with food. Such influences are handed down through generations and contribute to cultural heritage. Culture also affects the social aspects of food choices. Eating is often a communal experience that brings people together, and cultural traditions dictate various social customs related to food, such as dining etiquette, seating arrangements, and serving rituals.

Across cultures and throughout history, the act of sharing a meal has been a way to foster connections, build relationships, and promote inclusivity. In today's increasingly diverse world, the cultural significance of food in promoting inclusivity cannot be overstated. Food is a universal language that transcends barriers of language, race, and religion. It is a tangible expression of culture, and by sharing our culinary traditions, we can gain a deeper understanding and appreciation for one another. When we sit down at a table and share a meal, we are not just nourishing our bodies; we are nourishing our souls and forging connections with those around us. One of the most beautiful aspects of food is its ability to tell a story. Each dish carries with it a rich history and a unique set of traditions. By exploring the culinary traditions of different cultures, we can gain insight into their values, beliefs, and way of life. Food becomes a gateway to understanding and appreciating the diversity of our world. Inclusivity is about more than just tolerance; it is about actively seeking out and embracing different perspectives and experiences. Food provides a tangible way to do this. By seeking out and trying new cuisines, we can expand our horizons and challenge our preconceived notions. We can break down stereotypes and build bridges between cultures. Food also has the power to create a sense of belonging. In a world that can often feel divided, the act of coming together to share a meal can create a sense of unity and community.

While there are a number of advantages to growing up in a rural environment, such as wide open spaces and a tight-knit community, many young people in rural America believe that the challenges outweigh the perks. Young people who choose to relocate to urban areas are typically seeking higher wages and increased access to resources such as healthcare, education, and healthy food. The Center for American Progress reports that rural areas constitute 97 percent of America\u2019s landmass, yet those same areas are home to only about one-fifth of the national population. As such, those living in rural communities are more likely to experience poverty and have reduced access to healthy food and public transportation. Further, youth in rural America may not have as much opportunity to socialize with their peers, either in person or online. For young people living below the poverty line in rural areas, the idea of moving to the big city may be enticing. But the increased job opportunities in urban areas is only a small piece of a much larger picture when it comes to social mobility.

Many rural areas lack food retailers and are considered food deserts: areas with limited supplies of fresh, affordable foods. Ironically, some of these food deserts are in areas where farming is important to the local economy. In rural areas, access to food may be limited by financial constraints or other factors, such as transportation challenges. Rural shoppers may rely on more expensive and less nutritious food, such as the types available at gas station convenience stores, or face a long drive to a town with a supermarket or grocery store that stocks fresh produce, milk, eggs, and other staples. Some rural residents and households are food insecure, meaning they cannot rely on access to sufficient, affordable, and nutritious food at all times, increasing the risk of poor health outcomes. According to the 2017 United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS) publication Food Insecurity, Chronic Disease, and Health Among Working-Age Adults, food insecurity is strongly associated with chronic disease and poor health, both of which disproportionately affect rural populations. Long-term food insecurity can affect learning, development, productivity, physical and mental health, and family life. Food security can also be seen as a community-level issue. A 2002 USDA-ERS publication explains that community food security: In 2023, 13.5% of U.S. households were food insecure at some time, up from 12.8% in 2022, according to the USDA-ERS report, Household Food Security in the United States in 2023. The same report notes that the rate of food insecurity in rural areas increased, from 14.7% in 2022 to 15.4% in 2023. Children experience an increased burden related to food insecurity. According to Children Living in Households That Experienced Food Insecurity: United States, 2019\u20132020, 12.9% of children in nonmetropolitan areas live in",

Convenience stores are often more prevalent in areas with lesser access to grocery stores. Many of these establishments have high amounts of cheap ultra-processed foods which have been shown to be linked to heart diseases, obesity, postmenopausal breast cancer, depression, and various cancers (Chen et. al., 2020). Convenience stores have also been linked with higher diabetes rates in many rural counties regardless of income (Haynes-Maslow & Leone, 2017). Sometimes these diabetes rates can go unnoticed in areas where health care access is limited. Between 2005 and 2014, people with undiagnosed diabetes were 81% more likely to be food insecure (Walker et al., 2019). However, having access to food isn\u2019t always the biggest problem. Oftentimes, the available food options are sold at a higher price which can make buying essential foods difficult for lower-income families. As of 2018, the rural New York per capita income is more than $25,000 lower than the average per capita income of New York State (Rural Health Information Hub, 2020). Families living in these areas must find cheaper food options which usually involves buying less nutritious foods. The impact of eating a nutrient deficient diet is most concerning when looking at populations of rural children. In 2019, homes where children were living had a higher percentage of food insecurity than the national average (USDA, 2020). Food insecurity had been shown to be linked with several serious chronic diseases in children and adults including iron deficiency anemia, asthma, mental health issues, obesity, and coronary heart disease (Food Research and Action Center, 2017).

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative. About Youth Futures Foundation Youth Futures Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation established with a \u00a390m endowment from the Reclaim Fund to improve employment outcomes for young people from marginalised backgrounds.

A lack of resources, infrastructure, and \u201cautonomy to pursue strategic long-term planning\u201d (Assane, 2019) are some of the key constraints rural areas face in addressing newer challenges such as COVID- 19 and longstanding challenges of poverty, population growth, climate change, and food insecurity. Community garden projects have emerged as innovative grassroots initiatives that address food insecurity and empower local communities by providing a space for cultivation, skill-sharing, and social interaction. Agricultural practices and land use play a vital role in sustaining human life, and their efficiency and sustainability are crucial for the well-being of communities. In rural areas, where agriculture often serves as the backbone of the local economy, food systems are of paramount importance. These systems encompass the entire food production, distribution, consumption, and waste management journey. However, rural food systems face unique challenges and opportunities that require careful consideration to ensure food security, economic growth, and environmental sustainability. Overview of Food Systems 1. Food Availability: Agriculture, the backbone of food production, is highly dependent on stable and predictable climate conditions. However, changing weather patterns due to climate change disrupt growing seasons, water availability, and pest dynamics (Riley & Crush, 2023). Droughts, floods, heatwaves, and extreme weather events become more frequent and severe, leading to reduced crop yields and even crop failures. These disruptions affect not only staple crops but also livestock and fish populations, causing a decline in the overall availability of food resources. 2. Food Accessibility: Food accessibi",

Login Alert Article contents Socio-economic and cultural disparities in diet among adolescents and young adults: a systematic review Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 30 August 2019 Abstract To explore dietary differences according to socio-economic and sociocultural characteristics of adolescents and young adults. A systematic review was conducted. The main search source was MEDLINE, consulted between January 2012 and March 2017. Quality of selected studies was assessed based on dietary measurement method, sample selection, socio-economic indicator choice and statistical modelling. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, assessing relationships between socio-economic status and dietary intake (patterns, scores and food groups) in the 10- to 40-year-old general population of high-income countries, were selected. Among the 7250 reports identified, forty were selected, seventeen of which were of high quality; their conclusions, related only to adolescents, were combined and presented. The most favourable dietary patterns, higher dietary scores, greater consumption of fruits, vegetables and dairy products, and lower consumption of sugary sweetened beverages and energy-dense foods, were associated with better parental socio-economic status, particularly in terms of higher education. Migrant status was associated with plant-based patterns, greater consumption of fruits and vegetables and of sugary sweetened beverages and energy-dense foods. For the other food groups, and for young adults, very few high-quality studies were found. The socio-economic gradient in adolescent diets requires confirmation by higher-grade studies of a wider set of food groups and must be extended to young adult populations. Future nutritional interventions should involve the most vulnerable adolescent populations, taking account of ",

Inadequate access to cultural foods can create cultural stress and affect one\u2019s identity and well-being. In particular, second-generation U.S. American student populations may have a higher risk for cultural stress due to being away from family, academic stress, environmental changes, and diminished financial stability to purchase cultural foods. Thus, an exploratory qualitative methodology was used to elicit information about second-generation U.S. Americans\u2019 food experiences to identify how cultural foods play a role in individual identity and how individual well-being is influenced by the presence or lack of cultural foods. Sixteen semi-structured interviews were conducted with second-generation American students at the University of Nevada, Reno, who self-identified as a cultural or ethnic minority. A standard thematic analysis was conducted. The authors identified that cultural food security influenced the ability to practice foodways, which tied Second-generation American students to their cultural identities. The absence of foodways led to anxiety and depression among students, amplifying the feelings of identity degradation. Second-generation American students discussed that the ability to practice their foodways improved multiple well-being components and led to feelings of happiness, decreased stress, warmth, better digestion, and a sense of belonging, comfort, and safety. College populations continue to grow and become more diverse, and with the increasing Second-generation American students, it is essential to improve the access and availability of cultural foods to improve their overall well-being.

It not only sustains us physically but also plays a significant role in shaping our cultural identity. The way we prepare, consume, and share food reflects our traditions, values, and beliefs. In this article, we will explore the influence of food on cultural identity and how cuisine can bridge the gaps between different cultures. Cultural identity is a complex concept that encompasses various aspects of our lives, including language, customs, and traditions. Food, being a universal necessity, is an essential component of cultural identity. Different regions and countries have their unique culinary traditions, which are passed down through generations. These traditions not only define a particular culture but also provide a sense of belonging and pride. When people from different cultures come together, food becomes a powerful tool for cultural exchange. It allows individuals to share their culinary traditions, learn about new flavors, and appreciate the diversity of cuisines. Through food, we can experience different cultures without leaving our own communities. It opens up a world of flavors and aromas, creating a sense of unity and understanding. One example of how food bridges cultural gaps is the popularity of ethnic restaurants. These establishments offer a taste of different cultures, allowing people to explore new cuisines and experience the traditions associated with them. Whether it's a Mexican taqueria, an Indian curry house, or a Japanese sushi bar, these restaurants provide a platform for cultural exchange.

The high costs in major cities, exacerbated by factors like the housing crisis, significantly impact young professionals' ability to afford basic necessities, let alone engage in costly networking activities essential for career advancement.  Furthermore, while smaller towns may offer lower housing costs, they often lack access to specialized healthcare, a critical factor for long-term physical and mental well-being, as detailed by the GAO's 2023 report on rural healthcare access. This report highlights the scarcity of specialized services and the increased travel distances required for care, potentially negating any perceived benefits of lower living costs.

        "In this debate, we shall argue that escaping from big cities, defined as relocating from major metropolitan areas to smaller towns or rural communities, is the way out, meaning a path towards greater overall well-being, for today's young people (individuals aged 18-35).\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing overall well-being, encompassing financial stability, mental and physical health, community engagement, and personal growth. This framework is appropriate as the motion centers on finding the optimal path to a better life for young people.\n\nFirst, escaping big cities offers a more affordable and less stressful path to financial stability for young people.  The significantly lower cost of living, especially housing, in smaller towns compared to metropolitan areas like New York City, where the median rent is $3,500/month (1), allows for increased saving and investment opportunities.  For example, a comparative study by Saving to Invest showed that a monthly budget of $4,000 in a small town provides a comparable lifestyle to a $10,000 budget in a big city (2). This financial stability reduces stress and enables entrepreneurial pursuits, directly contributing to overall well-being.  Furthermore,  programs designed to attract young professionals, like remote work incentives and business grants, are increasingly common in smaller communities, furthering their financial prospects.\n\nSecond, escaping big cities promotes better mental and physical health.  Studies show urban dwellers have a 20% higher risk of developing depression compared to those in rural areas (3).  Smaller communities offer stronger social connections, mitigating the loneliness often experienced in large cities.  Additionally,  increased access to nature, with its proven benefits for stress reduction and physical activity (4), further enhances both mental and physical well-being.  This is crucial to the overall well-being of young people, allowing them to thrive in a healthier environment.  For instance, access to hiking trails, parks, and open spaces is typically far greater in less densely populated areas, providing opportunities for a more active and nature-connected lifestyle.\n\nThird, escaping big cities fosters greater personal growth and fulfillment. While big cities may seem to offer more career options, the intense competition can be detrimental to personal development. Smaller towns often foster deeper community involvement, providing opportunities for leadership roles and contributing to local initiatives.  This sense of belonging and purpose, demonstrated by higher volunteerism rates in smaller communities (Evidence Needed), contributes significantly to overall well-being.  The focus shifts from individual career advancement to a more holistic approach to personal growth, embracing diverse opportunities for contribution and connection.  This, in turn, leads to a richer, more meaningful life experience.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities provides a pathway to enhanced overall well-being for young people through improved financial stability, better mental and physical health, and greater personal growth and fulfillment.\n\nReference:\n(1) renthop.com - Median Rent in New York, NY (Need specific date access for full citation)\n(2) Saving to Invest.

        "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement focuses narrowly on career advancement and access to resources, neglecting the crucial components of a fulfilling life for young people.  They redefine \"way out\" as purely career-driven, overlooking our definition which prioritizes *overall well-being*, encompassing financial stability, mental and physical health, community engagement, and personal growth.  We will demonstrate how escaping big cities offers a superior path to this holistic well-being, directly addressing the negative\u2019s arguments.\n\nFirst, the negative team claims big cities offer unparalleled career opportunities, particularly for entrepreneurs.  While metropolitan hubs may have a concentration of specific industries, this argument ignores two key factors.  One, the rise of remote work allows young professionals to pursue careers in any industry, regardless of location, enhancing financial stability *without* the inflated living costs of big cities. Two, smaller communities are actively fostering growth in diverse sectors, attracting young professionals and entrepreneurs.  For example, the town of Corsicana, Texas, implemented a remote worker incentive program offering $10,000 in cash grants, demonstrating the proactive efforts of smaller communities to attract talent and boost local economies (1).  This directly addresses our first argument about financial stability, showing how escaping big cities allows young people to build successful careers *and* achieve financial security without the burdens of high urban living costs.\n\nSecond, the opponents overstate the networking opportunities in big cities.  They emphasize quantity over quality. While large cities may host numerous networking events, these often lack the depth and genuine connection found in smaller communities.  Studies, like those conducted by the University of Kansas, show that stronger social ties in rural areas significantly contribute to lower stress levels and improved mental health (2). This directly reinforces our point about mental and physical health, demonstrating how the strong community bonds fostered in smaller towns offer tangible well-being benefits often missing in the impersonal environment of big cities. In contrast, superficial interactions at large-scale networking events offer limited value for genuine professional and personal growth.\n\nThird, the negative highlights the diverse cultural experiences of big cities.  However, they overlook the vibrant cultural scenes thriving in smaller towns, offering unique experiences often more deeply connected to the community.  Moreover, the prohibitive cost of entertainment in large cities severely limits access for many young people.  For instance, a concert ticket that might cost $100 in a major city is often half the price in a smaller venue, making cultural engagement more accessible and financially sustainable. This affordability reinforces the financial stability aspect of our case, demonstrating how escaping big cities allows young people to enjoy a rich cultural life *without* compromising their financial well-being. Smaller communities offer an affordable and enriching cultural landscape, directly fostering personal growth and community engagement.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, the negative's narrow focus on career opportunities fails to address the broader definition of a successful life.  Overall well-being, which includes mental and physical health, financial stability *independent* of high urban salaries, and a sense of community and belonging, is a more comprehensive and meaningful metric than simply career advancement.  The American Psychological Association emphasizes the critical role of social connection, stress management, and work-life balance in overall well-being (3), all of which are more readily attainable in the less pressured environment of smaller towns. This directly addresses *why* overall well-being is a more important metric, emphasizing that a fulfilling life encompasses far more than just career success.  Escaping big cities allows young people to prioritize these crucial elements, creating a truly successful and meaningful life.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) CNBC.

        "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate revolves around whether escaping big cities is the way out for young people, a \"way out\" defined as achieving overall well-being. We believe it unequivocally is.\n\nThe negative team focused on career advancement, but a fulfilling life requires more than a high salary. While they argued that big cities offer better job prospects, they overlooked the transformative rise of remote work.  This allows young people to earn competitive salaries while enjoying the significantly lower living costs of smaller towns.  Programs like Corsicana, Texas's remote worker incentive, offering $10,000 grants, demonstrate the proactive efforts of smaller communities to attract talent and boost local economies. This directly addresses financial stability, a cornerstone of well-being, by showing that escaping big cities doesn't mean sacrificing career prospects.  It means maximizing your earnings by minimizing your expenses.\n\nThe opponents raised concerns about healthcare access in smaller towns.  While access to specialized care can be a challenge, small-town living fosters preventative health through reduced stress, increased access to nature, and healthier lifestyles, potentially lessening the *need* for specialized care. Moreover, telehealth is rapidly bridging the gap in access to specialists, further mitigating this concern.\n\nRegarding cultural experiences, while big cities offer a concentration of options, they come at a steep price. Smaller towns offer unique cultural experiences deeply connected to the community, and at a fraction of the cost.  This affordability allows young people to engage with the arts and local events without straining their finances, further enhancing their overall well-being.\n\nFinally, the negative highlighted the importance of networking.  While in-person connections are valuable, they overstated their importance in the digital age.  Online platforms and targeted strategies allow remote workers to build robust professional networks, irrespective of location.  Moreover, the quality of connections fostered within tight-knit small-town communities often surpasses the superficial interactions of large-scale networking events in big cities.\n\nEscaping big cities represents a conscious choice to prioritize genuine connection and holistic well-being.  It\u2019s about choosing a life rich in community, nature, and deeper relationships, a life where financial security, health, and personal growth are valued over a purely career-driven existence.  For today\u2019s young people, escaping big cities isn't a retreat; it\u2019s a strategic advance towards a more fulfilling and meaningful life.\n\nReferences:\n(1) CNBC.

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow debaters, let\u2019s talk about something deeply personal: the future of our young people.  We\u2019re here today to discuss whether escaping the hustle and bustle of big city life is truly the best path for them.  We firmly believe it\u2019s not. We believe that returning to, or remaining in, a major metropolitan area offers significantly greater opportunities for our youth.\n\nLet\u2019s start with careers. Think about it: where are the cutting-edge industries, the innovative companies, the jobs of the future? They\u2019re in our big cities. Look at Austin's \"Silicon Hills,\" a hotbed of tech innovation, or the thriving job market in San Francisco.  These cities are magnets for industries like tech, finance, and healthcare, offering young people a chance to explore diverse career paths and discover their true calling.  *This isn't just about finding a job; it's about finding the right job.*\n\nAnd for those young entrepreneurs with a fire in their belly and a dream in their heart, big cities are the place to be.  Think about the concentration of venture capital firms, the incubators like WeWork Labs, the accelerators that provide crucial funding and mentorship.  Reports like \"The Top 50+ Entrepreneur Friendly Cities\" highlight the unique support systems available in these urban centers.  These resources, coupled with the proximity to established businesses, create a synergistic environment where innovation thrives and startups are launched.  *Big cities offer a launchpad for dreams.*\n\nNow, let me turn to the power of networking.  We\u2019ve all heard the saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d  Well, in big cities like New York, San Francisco, and Austin, who you know can make all the difference.  These cities are teeming with young professionals drawn by booming industries, as sources like Forbes and The Relocation Helper confirm [1].  They\u2019re also hubs for networking opportunities, from industry-specific events to young professional groups, as highlighted by Meetup.com [4].  *Imagine being surrounded by like-minded individuals, potential mentors, and future collaborators.*  That\u2019s the power of big city networking.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just formal networking events.  It\u2019s the everyday interactions, the shared workspaces, the chance encounters at a coffee shop that can lead to unexpected connections and open doors to new opportunities.  The sheer density and diversity of people in urban centers create a dynamic environment for organic networking, fostering career growth and personal development.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s talk about life beyond work.  What makes life worth living?  For many young people, it\u2019s the vibrant energy, the cultural experiences, the sheer diversity of a big city.  Think about world-class museums, diverse culinary scenes, and endless entertainment options.  These experiences broaden horizons, spark creativity, and contribute to overall well-being.  *Imagine having access to a world of art, culture, and entertainment right at your doorstep.*  That\u2019s the richness of big city living.\n\nThis diverse environment exposes young people to new perspectives, ideas, and ways of life, fostering personal growth and a deeper understanding of the world.  The vibrancy and dynamism of city life contribute significantly to personal development and overall life satisfaction.  Escaping this environment limits access to these transformative experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while smaller towns may offer a quieter pace, big cities provide an unparalleled environment for growth, opportunity, and connection.  The concentration of industries, the vibrant networking scene, and the rich tapestry of experiences make remaining in, or returning to, a big city the optimal path for today\u2019s young people.  *Let\u2019s empower our youth to thrive in the heart of the action, where their dreams can take flight.*\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow debaters, let\u2019s talk about something that hits close to home for many of us: where we choose to live and build our lives.  Our opponents have painted a charming picture of small-town life, but I\u2019m here to tell you that this picture misses some crucial details, especially for young people like us trying to navigate today\u2019s world.\n\nThey talk about financial stability being easier to achieve outside big cities.  But let\u2019s be real, how many of you have worried about making ends meet, about affording rent, groceries, or even just a night out?  This isn\u2019t just a personal worry; it\u2019s a global one.  Deloitte\u2019s 2023 survey of young people across 44 countries found that the *number one* concern for Gen Z and millennials is the cost of living [1].  Sure, rent might be lower in smaller towns, but what good is that if jobs are scarce and salaries are significantly lower?  It\u2019s like trading one financial challenge for another.  And what about healthcare?  We all want to be healthy, and access to good healthcare is a big part of that.  The Government Accountability Office, or GAO, pointed out in 2023 that access to specialized healthcare, the kind you might need for a serious illness or a specific condition, is much harder to come by in rural areas [2].  This isn\u2019t just an inconvenience; it\u2019s a real barrier to well-being.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about mental health.  Our opponents emphasize the strong social ties in smaller communities, and yes, those connections are important.  But they\u2019re only part of the picture.  What happens when you need professional help?  Again, the GAO report highlights the difficulties young people in rural areas face accessing mental health services [2].  Big cities, with their diverse range of mental health professionals and facilities, offer a safety net that\u2019s often missing in smaller towns.  Having a supportive community is great, but it\u2019s not a substitute for professional care when you need it.\n\nThey also praise the vibrant cultural scenes in smaller towns.  But think about it: how many world-class museums, theaters, and music venues are within easy reach in a small town versus a big city?  The \"Room to Rise\" study showed how transformative intensive arts programs can be for teenagers, leading to significant personal and professional growth [5].  These opportunities are simply more abundant in cities.  While small towns have their own charm, big cities offer a richer, more diverse cultural landscape that can broaden your horizons in ways a small town simply can\u2019t.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about remote work.  Yes, it offers flexibility, but it doesn\u2019t replace the power of face-to-face connections.  We\u2019ve all heard the saying, \u201cIt\u2019s not what you know, it\u2019s who you know.\u201d  Well, studies show that a whopping 85% of jobs are filled through networking [3].  Big cities are hubs for industry events, conferences, and those chance encounters that can lead to your next big break.  These opportunities are simply harder to come by in smaller, less connected communities.\n\nFinally, our opponents talk about overall well-being.  We agree that\u2019s the ultimate goal.  But well-being isn\u2019t just about mental and physical health; it\u2019s about financial security, personal growth, and having the opportunity to reach your full potential.  Big cities, with their diverse industries, advanced healthcare systems, and rich cultural scenes, offer a more complete package.  They provide the resources and opportunities for young people to thrive in all aspects of their lives.  Returning to, or staying in, a big city isn\u2019t just about climbing the career ladder; it\u2019s about building a fulfilling life, a life filled with opportunities, resources, and experiences that empower you to become the best version of yourself.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1.

        "Friends, judges, let\u2019s talk about opportunity.  Think about starting your career, building a life, chasing your dreams. Where do you picture yourself? Our opponents paint a charming picture of small-town life, but it just doesn't match the reality for young people today.  This boils down to two things: what you can get, and what you can become.\n\nFirst, what you can get \u2013 *access*.  They talk about lower costs, but what about access to the things you really need?  Think about specialized healthcare.  According to a study published in *Urban Studies* [7], big cities offer far better access to specialists, meaning better care when you need it most.  And while living in a big city might seem expensive, research consistently shows higher salaries and more job opportunities, creating a stronger financial footing in the long run.\n\nSecond, what you can become \u2013 *opportunity*.  They say remote work makes location irrelevant, but let's be real.  Who hasn't landed a job or a big break through a chance encounter?  Studies in the *Journal of Regional Science* [3, 4] confirm what we all know: big cities are networking hubs.  They're overflowing with connections, mentors, and the spark of innovation.  Research from *Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice* [5, 6] and *Small Business Economics* [8] shows that these environments are crucial for startups and career growth.  Plus, think about the sheer variety of jobs and industries in a big city [1, 2].  That's the kind of environment where you can truly discover your passion.\n\nSo, while that small-town quiet might sound nice, it can't compete with the energy and opportunity of a big city.  For young people building a future, staying in or returning to a big city isn't just a choice, it's an investment.  An investment in your career, your health, your growth, your future.  Vote against the motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. The Relocation Helper. *Best Cities for Young Professionals*. https://therelocationhelper.com/best-cities-for-young-professionals/\n2.
