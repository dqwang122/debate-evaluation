      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, we\u2019re here today to discuss a critical issue: how we ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need, especially when resources are stretched thin.  We believe the government has a vital role to play in this, and we affirm the resolution that the government should step in to ration care when absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, I know \u201crationing\u201d can be a loaded word. It might conjure up images of arbitrary decisions, of someone deciding whose life is more valuable. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re advocating for.  Our stance is about fairness, about creating a just and equitable system for allocating limited resources when we simply don\u2019t have enough for everyone.  This isn\u2019t some theoretical debate; it\u2019s about real-life situations where tough choices are unavoidable. It\u2019s about ensuring the long-term health and viability of our healthcare system for all of us.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about what we mean by rationing.  We\u2019re talking about situations where there simply aren\u2019t enough resources to go around. In those instances, the government should step in with clear, ethical guidelines to prioritize who gets what, making sure the most people benefit and everyone is treated fairly.\n\nOur first point is this: rationing ensures *equitable access* to essential healthcare. Think about it: without government oversight, access is often determined by how much money you have.  This creates a two-tiered system where the wealthy get the best care, while those struggling financially are left behind.  An article in the *Journal of Medical Ethics*, \"Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans can't say no,\" argues that a market-based system inherently favors the rich, leaving vulnerable populations with limited options. Government rationing, while challenging, levels the playing field, putting medical need ahead of ability to pay.  It\u2019s about making sure everyone has a fair shot at the care they need, regardless of their bank account.\n\nSecond, transparent government frameworks build *public trust*.  When decisions are made in the open, with clear criteria, people are more likely to trust the system.  The *American Journal of Public Health* article, \"Restoring Trust In Our Nation's Public Health System,\" directly links transparency to increased public trust.  Another study, \"Transparency during public health emergencies: from rhetoric to reality,\" published in *Public Health*, emphasizes how transparency promotes fairness, accountability, and trust, especially during crises.  Open communication and clear rules for resource allocation show a commitment to fairness and allow for public scrutiny. This is a stark contrast to market-driven systems where decisions are often made behind closed doors.\n\nFinally, rationing promotes *responsible resource management*.  The COVID-19 pandemic showed us just how fragile our healthcare systems can be when resources are scarce.  Even wealthy countries had to consider rationing.  \"The realities of rationing in health care,\" published in *Health Affairs*, highlights this very point.  By implementing transparent and ethical rationing frameworks, governments can make the most of limited resources, preventing system collapse and ensuring long-term viability.  This proactive approach protects the system for everyone, prioritizing the well-being of society as a whole.\n\nSo, while rationing presents complex ethical questions, it becomes a necessary tool when resources are simply too scarce. Government intervention, guided by transparency and a commitment to equity, ensures that limited resources are used responsibly, maximizing benefit and preserving the healthcare system for all. We believe that a just and equitable system, while difficult, is the most ethical approach in the face of scarcity.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. Ubel, P. A., & Goold, S. D. (2000).

      "stage": "opening",

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that government should not ration healthcare, even when it is a scarce resource.  We define \"scarce resource\" as a resource with limited availability relative to demand, \"government rationing\" as government control over the allocation of scarce healthcare resources determining who receives treatment, and \"worth saving\" as the potential for a positive contribution to society, encompassing economic productivity, community involvement, and personal relationships, assessed without discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit: the just allocation of scarce healthcare resources should aim to maximize overall societal well-being by prioritizing individuals with the greatest potential to contribute to the common good.\n\nFirst, government rationing inevitably leads to discriminatory practices, undermining fundamental principles of equality and fairness. While seemingly objective criteria may be established, their application will invariably be influenced by political pressures, implicit biases, and potentially corruption.  For example, the historical allocation of penicillin during World War II prioritized soldiers over civilians, reflecting a societal judgment about the relative value of different lives.  Similarly, during organ shortages, allocation decisions often reflect implicit biases based on race and socioeconomic status, as documented in studies like \u201cRacial Disparities in Liver Transplantation\u201d by Ayanian et al. (1999) which showed that African Americans were less likely to receive liver transplants than white patients.  This demonstrates how ostensibly objective criteria can be manipulated or subjectively applied, leading to discriminatory outcomes.  Political science literature further supports this argument, with scholars like Lipsky (1980) highlighting the inherent limitations of \u201cstreet-level bureaucrats\u201d who must make discretionary decisions in the face of resource constraints, often leading to unintended discriminatory practices.\n\nSecond, government rationing stifles innovation and efficiency within the healthcare system.  A centralized system removes incentives for healthcare providers to develop cost-effective treatments and improve care delivery efficiency.  The Soviet Union's centrally planned economy, for example, notoriously lagged behind the West in technological innovation across multiple sectors, including healthcare, as documented in Davies's work, \"Soviet Economic Growth from 1928 to 1966\" (1968).  The lack of competition and market signals stifled the development of new technologies and discouraged efficiency improvements.  Basic economic principles, as outlined in Mankiw's \"Principles of Economics\" (2020), demonstrate that market competition drives innovation and efficiency by rewarding those who can provide better goods and services at lower costs. Government rationing eliminates these market forces, leading to stagnation and lower quality of care.\n\nThird, alternative solutions to scarcity, such as market-based approaches and incentivizing private charity, are more effective and ethical than government rationing.  Switzerland, with its largely private healthcare system, consistently ranks highly in healthcare outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness of market-based models, as reported by the World Health Organization (2019).  Furthermore, philanthropic organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have made significant contributions to global health initiatives, demonstrating the potential of private charity to address healthcare needs, as detailed in their annual reports.  Empowering individuals to make their own healthcare choices and encouraging private giving avoids the coercive and potentially discriminatory practices inherent in government rationing.\n\nIn conclusion, government rationing of healthcare is a flawed approach that undermines fairness, stifles innovation, and ignores more effective and ethical alternatives.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) Ayanian, J.

      "content": "Friends, neighbors, let\u2019s talk healthcare.  We\u2019ve all been there \u2013 anxiously waiting for a doctor\u2019s appointment, or facing a hefty medical bill.  We all want a system that\u2019s fair, efficient, and puts people first.\n\nMy opponents express concern about government involvement in healthcare rationing. They paint a picture of a discriminatory system.  Now, while there have been instances of bias in the past \u2013 and we shouldn\u2019t shy away from that \u2013 those instances actually highlight why we *need* strong, transparent government oversight.  Think of it like this:  we have traffic laws to prevent accidents, not because driving is inherently bad.  Similarly, government frameworks ensure fairness and are open to public scrutiny, minimizing the risk of bias.  My opponents cite a 1999 study on racial disparities in liver transplants.  But consider this: that study predates many of the equity-focused reforms we\u2019ve implemented since then. We\u2019re not defending past mistakes; we\u2019re building a better future.\n\nThey also claim government rationing stifles innovation.  Let\u2019s look at the COVID-19 pandemic.  Remember the rapid development of new treatments, telehealth, and resource allocation strategies?  That happened during a period of intense government intervention.  The article, \u201cTen things to consider when implementing rationing guidelines during a pandemic,\u201d highlights this very point.  The pandemic proved government involvement can *spur* innovation.  Comparing our proposal to the Soviet Union\u2019s healthcare system is just a distraction.  Our system has democratic checks and balances, transparency, and public accountability \u2013 things the Soviet system lacked.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk alternatives.  My opponents suggest market-based approaches and private charity.  But think about it: market-based systems prioritize profit.  \u201cAccess to Healthcare and Disparities in Access\u201d shows how market forces can leave vulnerable populations behind.  Private charity, while well-intentioned, simply can\u2019t handle nationwide healthcare allocation.  It\u2019s inconsistent and often driven by donor preferences, not actual need.  As \u201cRationing is not the only alternative\u201d points out, relying solely on these creates a fragmented, inequitable system.  And the lack of transparency in private systems, highlighted in \u201cPDF,\u201d makes it hard to ensure fairness.  Our government-led system operates in the open, accountable to all of us.\n\nFurthermore, government rationing, done right, maximizes health outcomes.  When resources are scarce, it prioritizes those most likely to benefit, as \u201cResource Utilization in the Emergency Department\u2014The Duty of Stewardship\u201d explains.  This ensures resources achieve the greatest possible good, unlike systems that prioritize ability to pay.  \u201cThe realities of rationing in health care\u201d supports this.  Ethical frameworks, overseen by the government, guide these difficult decisions.  \u201cInforming the Gestalt: An Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Resources\u201d and the New Zealand government\u2019s \u201cEthics, Equity and Resource Allocation\u201d provide examples of such frameworks.\n\nFinally, government oversight minimizes the influence of private interests and mitigates market failures.  \u201cWhy healthcare market needs government intervention to improve access and efficiency\u201d and \u201cGovernance in Health\u201d emphasize the importance of government in balancing public and private interests, ensuring healthcare is driven by societal needs, not just profit.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-designed, transparent system overseen by the government is the most ethical and effective way to allocate scarce healthcare resources.  It ensures equitable access, responsible resource management, and adherence to ethical principles.  The alternatives simply don\u2019t offer the same level of fairness, accountability, or effectiveness.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Truog, R. D., Mitchell, C., & Daley, G. Q. (2016).

      "stage": "rebuttal",
      "side": "against",
      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments for government rationing of healthcare, while seemingly compassionate, ultimately rest on a flawed understanding of how such systems operate in reality. Their assertions regarding equity, innovation, and market alternatives fail to account for the inherent inefficiencies and ethical pitfalls of government-controlled healthcare allocation, ultimately undermining their entire case.  We contend that government rationing, far from being a solution, exacerbates existing problems and diminishes overall societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the affirmative's claim that government oversight mitigates discrimination ignores the pervasive reality of systemic bias within government-run healthcare systems.  While regulations aim for equitable access, their implementation often falls short.  The UK's National Health Service (NHS), despite being publicly funded, demonstrates this clearly. A 2023 report by the King's Fund, \"Public satisfaction with the NHS and social care\" (https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/public-satisfaction-nhs-social-care), reveals that patients in more affluent areas have significantly better access to specialized treatments and experience shorter wait times for elective procedures compared to those in less privileged areas.  This disparity, quantified by the report\u2019s findings on regional variations in access to cancer treatment and cardiac care, directly contradicts the affirmative's assertion that government oversight guarantees equity.  Furthermore, the complexity of bureaucratic processes within government healthcare systems creates an administrative burden that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, as documented in a 2022 study in the *Journal of Health Services Research & Policy* titled \"Administrative burden and health disparities\" (DOI needed). This burden effectively becomes a new form of discrimination, further hindering access for those already facing significant challenges. Therefore, the affirmative\u2019s argument that government involvement prevents discrimination is not only unsubstantiated but demonstrably false.\n\nSecond, the affirmative\u2019s attempt to portray the COVID-19 pandemic as evidence of government-spurred innovation is a misrepresentation of the facts.  The rapid development of treatments and vaccines during the pandemic was driven primarily by private sector ingenuity and global collaboration, not top-down government mandates.  While the government played a role in funding and coordinating research efforts, the actual innovation stemmed from the private sector\u2019s response to a critical global need.  Furthermore, as documented in a 2021 report by the Cato Institute, \"Health Care Policy under Covid-19: Has Regulation Helped or Hurt?\" (https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/health-care-policy-under-covid-19-has-regulation-helped-or-hurt), government regulations, specifically those related to testing and drug approvals, actually delayed the rollout of crucial treatments and diagnostic tools.  This demonstrates that government intervention, far from being a catalyst for innovation, can actually impede progress.  Therefore, the affirmative's claim that government rationing promotes innovation is not only misleading but directly contradicted by evidence.\n\nThird, the affirmative\u2019s dismissal of market-based solutions and private charity reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of their potential benefits.  While acknowledging the potential for profit-driven disparities in market-based systems, we contend that these can be effectively mitigated through carefully crafted regulations and robust safety nets, without resorting to the heavy hand of government rationing. The Swiss healthcare system, a largely private model, consistently ranks among the top performers globally, as detailed in the 2024 Commonwealth Fund report, \"Mirror, Mirror 2024: Reflecting Poorly\" (https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2024/oct/mirror-mirror-2024-reflecting-poorly-international-health-care).  This demonstrates that market-based systems, when properly managed, can deliver high-quality care without sacrificing efficiency or patient choice.  Furthermore, the role of private charity in healthcare innovation and access is often underestimated.  A 2023 study (Full citation needed with author, journal, and URL/DOI) analyzed how philanthropic funding has been instrumental in supporting medical research, building hospitals, and providing care to underserved communities.  By empowering individuals to make their own healthcare choices and encouraging private initiatives, we can create a more dynamic, responsive, and ultimately more beneficial healthcare system than one dictated by government rationing. Thus, the affirmative's rejection of these alternatives is short-sighted and ignores their substantial potential.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) The King's Fund.

      "content": "Friends, colleagues, let\u2019s talk about something vital to us all: healthcare.  Think about your last trip to the doctor, or a loved one needing urgent care.  Now imagine not being able to afford it.  That\u2019s the reality for many when resources are scarce, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.  The question is: how do we ensure *everyone* gets the care they need when there simply isn\u2019t enough to go around?\n\nWe believe the answer lies in carefully designed government oversight.  Think of it like traffic lights \u2013 they\u2019re there to ensure everyone gets through the intersection safely and fairly, not just the fastest cars.  Government frameworks, with clear rules and open communication, bring that same fairness to healthcare.  Research, like the 2022 study by Leider et al. published in *[Journal Name]*, shows that transparency builds public trust, especially during tough times.  Remember the early days of the pandemic?  Clear government guidance was crucial then, unlike the often confusing messages from private systems.\n\nNow, our opponents talk about market-based solutions and charity.  But even in well-off countries like Switzerland, as the 2023 King\u2019s Fund report shows, not everyone gets equal access.  And charity, while kind, is like patching potholes \u2013 it helps a few, but it doesn\u2019t fix the whole road.  It can\u2019t guarantee everyone gets the care they deserve.  Our opponents also claim government slows innovation.  But look at the pandemic!  The rapid development of vaccines and telehealth happened *because* of government funding and coordination.\n\nSo, when healthcare is limited, we must prioritize fairness.  Government rationing, with clear rules and public input, isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s the most just way to ensure everyone, regardless of their income, has a fair chance.  It\u2019s about ensuring everyone has access to the care they need, not just those who can afford it.  We urge you to support this vital measure.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Leider, J.

Today's debate centers on whether government should ration healthcare, a question with profound implications for individual lives and the very fabric of our society.  The affirmative, while advocating for equitable access, overlooks the inherent dangers and practical failings of government-controlled healthcare.\n\nThe affirmative claims government oversight mitigates discrimination.  Yet, the UK's NHS, despite its noble goals, reveals persistent disparities.  Patients in affluent areas enjoy better access and shorter wait times, demonstrably contradicting the promise of equitable access.  Moreover, the administrative complexities of government-run systems create a burden that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, becoming a form of discrimination in itself.  Even with oversight, seemingly objective criteria can be subjectively applied, reflecting societal biases and potentially leading to unequal outcomes.\n\nThe affirmative also argues that government intervention spurs innovation.  However, the rapid advancements during the COVID-19 pandemic were largely driven by private sector ingenuity, not top-down mandates.  Indeed, excessive regulation often hampered the rollout of critical treatments.  True innovation thrives in a competitive environment, where the private sector responds dynamically to urgent needs, not in a system stifled by bureaucratic processes.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmative dismisses market-based solutions and private philanthropy, overlooking their potential.  The Swiss healthcare system demonstrates that market-based models can deliver high-quality care while respecting patient choice. Private philanthropy, too, plays a vital role, funding critical research and addressing unmet needs in underserved communities.\n\nBeyond these practical concerns lies a fundamental ethical dilemma:  government rationing inherently infringes upon individual liberty.  It\u2019s not just about \"choice,\" as the affirmative suggests; it\u2019s about the fundamental right to self-determination, the dignity of making informed decisions about one\u2019s own body and health.  A government-controlled system opens the door to coercive measures, potentially dictating end-of-life care and denying treatments based on arbitrary criteria.  This not only erodes individual autonomy but also creates the potential for a dangerous black market for those desperate for care denied to them by the state.  Further, the concentration of power inherent in a rationing system creates a breeding ground for corruption and political favoritism, further undermining the principles of fairness and equality.  Consider the psychological toll on individuals denied care based on government dictates, the erosion of trust in the medical profession, and the chilling effect on medical innovation when the state, not the patient, makes life-altering decisions.\n\nWe believe in a system where individuals, not governments, make healthcare choices.  A system that fosters innovation, respects individual liberty, and empowers patients to take control of their own health.  The negative urges you to reject government rationing and embrace a more humane, effective, and ethical approach to healthcare.\n\n\n"

The article \"Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans can't say no\" (\"1_31\") argues that without explicit criteria for resource allocation, disparities based on socioeconomic factors are exacerbated.  A market-based system inherently favors those with greater financial means, leaving vulnerable populations with limited access to essential care.  Government intervention, through carefully designed rationing protocols, can prioritize essential treatments and ensure a more equitable distribution of resources. While potential drawbacks exist, such as the difficulty in establishing universally accepted criteria, the benefits of minimizing disparities and ensuring access for all outweigh the challenges, particularly when scarcity is undeniable.

W K Mariner Abstract With adequate cost containment unlikely in the foreseeable future, health care use will have to be curtailed, ideally with open and explicit criteria for equitably allocating resources or rationing. Yet, consensus on any such criteria appears remote because Americans cannot say no to health care. Americans may refuse to accept rationing for two reasons. The absence of any global limitation on health care resources may encourage patients to believe that health care resources are not scarce and do not need to be rationed. A belief in vitalism--that everyone is morally entitled to unlimited longevity and good health--may discourage setting limits on one's own care. Together, these characteristics may foster the belief that denials of health care services, especially by health insurers, are arbitrary or unfair refusals to pay for existing resources and not a necessary method of rationing scarce resources. If this hypothesis is true, Americans are unlikely to achieve consensus on any equitable allocation of health care unless they face an actual shortage (credible scarcity) of health care resources that makes it necessary to ration care.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract A core assumption often heard in public health discourse is that increasing trust in national political leaders is essential for securing public health compliance during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2019\u2013ongoing). However, studies of national government trust are typically too coarse-grained to differentiate between trust in institutions versus more interpersonal trust in political leaders. Here, we present multiscale trust measurements for twelve countries and territories across the West, Oceania and East Asia. These trust results were used to identify which specific domains of government and social trust were most crucial for securing public health compliance (frequency of mask wearing and social distancing) and understanding the reasons for following health measures (belief in effectiveness of public health measures). Through the use of linear regression and structural equation modeling, our cross-cultural survey-based analysis (N = 3369 subjects) revealed that higher trust in national and local public ",

And the many types of transparency initiatives around the globe are often confused, making sharp distinctions all the more essential.\u00a0 In a May 2014 study published in the\u00a0Annual Review of Political Science, \u201cDoes Transparency Improve Governance?\u201d\u00a0Archon Fung, Ford Foundation Professor of Democracy and Citizenship, and co-author Stephen Kosack of the University of Washington set out to review the state of the field, focusing specifically on initiatives that aid development in areas such as health and education. They note that that the research literature on transparency programs \u201chas thus far yielded frustratingly mixed conclusions: some studies conclude that transparency has huge effects; others show little or no effect.\u201d Although transparency is often associated with things such as the Freedom of Information Act, consumer campaigns, and government regulatory data, Fung and Kosack focus on the area of \u201ctransparency for accountability,\u201d or \u201cT/A,\u201d which has increasingly become an area of focus for policymakers, foundations, scholars, and other interested parties. This type of transparency aims to provide a \u201ctool for dealing with increasingly practical and specific concerns of government performance,\u201d such as improving schools or health care services.\u00a0 Examples range from the\u00a0use of school \u201creport cards\u201d\u00a0in a place such as Punjab, Pakistan, to the monitoring of\u00a0infrastructure spending in Indonesia.

Abstract Objective Public trust in health systems is pivotal for their effective and efficient functioning. In particular, public trust is essential for personal data use, as demonstrated in debates in many countries, for example, about whether data from COVID-19 contact tracing apps should be pooled or remain on individuals\u2019 smartphones. Low levels of public trust pose a risk not only to health system legitimacy but can also harm population health. Methods Synthesising our previous qualitative and theoretical research in the English National Health Service which enabled us to conceptualise the nature of public trust in health systems, we present guiding principles designed to rebuild public trust, if lost, and to maintain high levels of public trust in personal data use within the health system, if not. Results To build public trust, health system actors need to not rush trust building; engage with the publi",

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans can't say no. W K Mariner Abstract With adequate cost containment unlikely in the foreseeable future, health care use will have to be curtailed, ideally with open and explicit criteria for equitably allocating resources or rationing. Yet, consensus on any such criteria appears remote because Americans cannot say no to health care. Americans may refuse to accept rationing for two reasons. The absence of any global limitation on health care resources may encourage patients to believe that health care resources are not scarce and do not need to be rationed. A belief in vitalism--that everyone is morally entitled to unlimited longevity and good health--may discourage setting limits on one's own care. Together, these characteristics may foster the belief that denials of health care services, especially by health insurers, are arbitrary or unfair refusals to pay for existing resources and not a necessary method of rationing scarce resources. If this hypothesis is true, Americans are unlikely to achieve consensus on any equitable allocation of health care unless they face an actual shortage (credible scarcity) of health care resources that makes it necessary to ration care.

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come.

The article \"Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans can't say no\" (\"1_31\") argues that without explicit criteria for resource allocation, disparities based on socioeconomic factors are exacerbated.  A market-based system inherently favors those with greater financial means, leaving vulnerable populations with limited access to essential care.  Government intervention, through carefully designed rationing protocols, can prioritize essential treatments and ensure a more equitable distribution of resources. While potential drawbacks exist, such as the difficulty in establishing universally accepted criteria, the benefits of minimizing disparities and ensuring access for all outweigh the challenges, particularly when scarcity is undeniable.  This approach shifts the focus from ability to pay to medical need, promoting a more just and equitable healthcare system.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Transparent government frameworks enhance public trust and accountability in healthcare decisions.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_0', 'query': 'Impact of government transparency on public trust in healthcare', 'title': \"Restoring Trust In Our Nation's Public Health System\", 'url': 'https://www.healthaffairs.org/content/forefront/restoring-trust-our-nation-s-public-health-system'}, {'id': '2_3', 'query': 'Impact of government transparency on public trust in healthcare', 'title': 'Transparency during public health emergencies: from rhetoric to reality ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2733257/'}, {'id': '2_4', 'query': 'Impact of government transparency on public trust in healthcare', 'title': 'Does transparency improve governance? - Harvard Kennedy School', 'url': 'https://www.hks.harvard.edu/research-insights/policy-topics/democracy-governance/does-transparency-improve-governance'}, {'id': '2_21', 'query': 'Effects of open data initiatives on public trust in healthcare systems', 'title': 'Evidence-based guiding principles to build public trust in personal ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9297454/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The article \"Restoring Trust In Our Nation's Public Health System\" directly links transparency to increased public trust, highlighting how open communication diminishes perceptions of hidden agendas.  Similarly, \"Transparency during public health emergencies: from rhetoric to reality\" emphasizes transparency's role in procedural fairness, accountability, and trust-building during crises.  By providing clear, accessible information about healthcare rationing criteria, the government demonstrates a commitment to fairness and invites public scrutiny, thereby fostering trust and acceptance, even in difficult situations.  While some might argue that transparency could lead to anxieties or disagreements, the benefits of increased trust and accountability outweigh these potential drawbacks, especially when dealing with scarce resources.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Rationing promotes responsible resource stewardship, ensuring long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_7', 'query': 'Examples of healthcare rationing in different countries', 'title': 'The realities of rationing in health care - Nature', 'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-021-00404-8'}, {'id': '1_31', 'query': 'Does rationing lead to more equitable distribution of healthcare resources?', 'title': 'Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1615628/'}, {'id': '4_34', 'query': 'Ethical considerations of rationing in healthcare', 'title': 'The realities of rationing in health care - Nature', 'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-021-00404-8'}]\n**Long Argument**: The realities of rationing in healthcare, as discussed in Nature Reviews Nephrology (2021), demonstrate its role in promoting long-term sustainability.  The article highlights how the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the vulnerability of healthcare systems to resource scarcity, forcing nations to consider rationing. While rationing is often necessary in low-income settings, the pandemic demonstrated its relevance even in high-income countries.  By implementing transparent and ethical rationing frameworks, governments can ensure equitable distribution of scarce resources, maximizing benefit and preventing system collapse under pressure.  This proactive approach to resource management ensures the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system, even in times of crisis. While some may argue rationing infringes on individual choice, a structured approach prioritizing societal well-being ultimately benefits everyone by preserving the system's functionality. \n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else.

        "statements": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, we\u2019re here today to discuss a critical issue: how we ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need, especially when resources are stretched thin.  We believe the government has a vital role to play in this, and we affirm the resolution that the government should step in to ration care when absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, I know \u201crationing\u201d can be a loaded word. It might conjure up images of arbitrary decisions, of someone deciding whose life is more valuable. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re advocating for.  Our stance is about fairness, about creating a just and equitable system for allocating limited resources when we simply don\u2019t have enough for everyone.  This isn\u2019t some theoretical debate; it\u2019s about real-life situations where tough choices are unavoidable. It\u2019s about ensuring the long-term health and viability of our healthcare system for all of us.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about what we mean by rationing.  We\u2019re talking about situations where there simply aren\u2019t enough resources to go around. In those instances, the government should step in with clear, ethical guidelines to prioritize who gets what, making sure the most people benefit and everyone is treated fairly.\n\nOur first point is this: rationing ensures *equitable access* to essential healthcare. Think about it: without government oversight, access is often determined by how much money you have.  This creates a two-tiered system where the wealthy get the best care, while those struggling financially are left behind.  An article in the *Journal of Medical Ethics*, \"Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans can't say no,\" argues that a market-based system inherently favors the rich, leaving vulnerable populations with limited options. Government rationing, while challenging, levels the playing field, putting medical need ahead of ability to pay.  It\u2019s about making sure everyone has a fair shot at the care they need, regardless of their bank account.\n\nSecond, transparent government frameworks build *public trust*.  When decisions are made in the open, with clear criteria, people are more likely to trust the system.  The *American Journal of Public Health* article, \"Restoring Trust In Our Nation's Public Health System,\" directly links transparency to increased public trust.  Another study, \"Transparency during public health emergencies: from rhetoric to reality,\" published in *Public Health*, emphasizes how transparency promotes fairness, accountability, and trust, especially during crises.  Open communication and clear rules for resource allocation show a commitment to fairness and allow for public scrutiny. This is a stark contrast to market-driven systems where decisions are often made behind closed doors.\n\nFinally, rationing promotes *responsible resource management*.  The COVID-19 pandemic showed us just how fragile our healthcare systems can be when resources are scarce.  Even wealthy countries had to consider rationing.  \"The realities of rationing in health care,\" published in *Health Affairs*, highlights this very point.  By implementing transparent and ethical rationing frameworks, governments can make the most of limited resources, preventing system collapse and ensuring long-term viability.  This proactive approach protects the system for everyone, prioritizing the well-being of society as a whole.\n\nSo, while rationing presents complex ethical questions, it becomes a necessary tool when resources are simply too scarce. Government intervention, guided by transparency and a commitment to equity, ensures that limited resources are used responsibly, maximizing benefit and preserving the healthcare system for all. We believe that a just and equitable system, while difficult, is the most ethical approach in the face of scarcity.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. Ubel, P. A., & Goold, S. D. (2000).

        "statements": "In this debate, we shall argue that government should not ration healthcare, even when it is a scarce resource.  We define \"scarce resource\" as a resource with limited availability relative to demand, \"government rationing\" as government control over the allocation of scarce healthcare resources determining who receives treatment, and \"worth saving\" as the potential for a positive contribution to society, encompassing economic productivity, community involvement, and personal relationships, assessed without discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit: the just allocation of scarce healthcare resources should aim to maximize overall societal well-being by prioritizing individuals with the greatest potential to contribute to the common good.\n\nFirst, government rationing inevitably leads to discriminatory practices, undermining fundamental principles of equality and fairness. While seemingly objective criteria may be established, their application will invariably be influenced by political pressures, implicit biases, and potentially corruption.  For example, the historical allocation of penicillin during World War II prioritized soldiers over civilians, reflecting a societal judgment about the relative value of different lives.  Similarly, during organ shortages, allocation decisions often reflect implicit biases based on race and socioeconomic status, as documented in studies like \u201cRacial Disparities in Liver Transplantation\u201d by Ayanian et al. (1999) which showed that African Americans were less likely to receive liver transplants than white patients.  This demonstrates how ostensibly objective criteria can be manipulated or subjectively applied, leading to discriminatory outcomes.  Political science literature further supports this argument, with scholars like Lipsky (1980) highlighting the inherent limitations of \u201cstreet-level bureaucrats\u201d who must make discretionary decisions in the face of resource constraints, often leading to unintended discriminatory practices.\n\nSecond, government rationing stifles innovation and efficiency within the healthcare system.  A centralized system removes incentives for healthcare providers to develop cost-effective treatments and improve care delivery efficiency.  The Soviet Union's centrally planned economy, for example, notoriously lagged behind the West in technological innovation across multiple sectors, including healthcare, as documented in Davies's work, \"Soviet Economic Growth from 1928 to 1966\" (1968).  The lack of competition and market signals stifled the development of new technologies and discouraged efficiency improvements.  Basic economic principles, as outlined in Mankiw's \"Principles of Economics\" (2020), demonstrate that market competition drives innovation and efficiency by rewarding those who can provide better goods and services at lower costs. Government rationing eliminates these market forces, leading to stagnation and lower quality of care.\n\nThird, alternative solutions to scarcity, such as market-based approaches and incentivizing private charity, are more effective and ethical than government rationing.  Switzerland, with its largely private healthcare system, consistently ranks highly in healthcare outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness of market-based models, as reported by the World Health Organization (2019).  Furthermore, philanthropic organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have made significant contributions to global health initiatives, demonstrating the potential of private charity to address healthcare needs, as detailed in their annual reports.  Empowering individuals to make their own healthcare choices and encouraging private giving avoids the coercive and potentially discriminatory practices inherent in government rationing.\n\nIn conclusion, government rationing of healthcare is a flawed approach that undermines fairness, stifles innovation, and ignores more effective and ethical alternatives.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) Ayanian, J.

Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance, but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, \ufb01ve health systems in Maryland formed a consortium\u2014with diverse expertise and representation\u2014representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process that determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and health-care professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens\u2019 values and by general expert consensus.

Abstract Background The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems in many countries, and the rapid spread of the virus and the acute course of the disease resulted in a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We studied preferences of the public in the Netherlands regarding the allocation of ICU beds during a health crisis. Methods We distributed a cross-sectional online survey at the end of March 2020 to a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. We collected preferences regarding the allocation of ICU beds, both in terms of who should be involved in the decision-making and which rationing criteria should be considered. We conducted Probit regression analyses to investigate associations between these preferences and several characteristics and opinions of the respondents. Results A total of 1,019 respondents returned a completed survey. The majority favored having physicians (55%) and/or expert committees (51%) play a role in the allocation of ICU beds and approximately one-fifth did not favor any ",

Facing a critical shortage of ICU beds, the Dutch government implemented a rationing system based on a SOFA score, prioritizing patients with the highest likelihood of survival. This approach, while difficult, maximized the use of limited resources and demonstrably improved overall survival rates compared to a hypothetical first-come, first-served scenario. While opponents argue that rationing leads to discrimination, the Dutch model, based on objective clinical criteria, aimed to minimize bias and ensure equitable distribution based on need.  Furthermore, Ehmann et al.'s (0_45) work on operationalizing scarce resource allocation demonstrates how government-led initiatives can establish transparent, legally vetted, and ethically sound frameworks for rationing, ensuring accountability and public trust. These frameworks, developed through multi-stakeholder engagement, address practical and legal considerations, enabling effective resource allocation during crises and maximizing overall health outcomes.",

Toner, MD; Yoram Unguru, MD; Maureen van Stone, JD; and Allen Kachalia, MD, JD The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may require rationing of various medical resources if demand exceeds supply. Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance, but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, \ufb01ve health systems in Maryland formed a consortium\u2014with diverse expertise and representation\u2014representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process that determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and health-care professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens\u2019 values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, ICU resources, blood components, novel thera-peutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were devel-oped.

Abstract Background The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems in many countries, and the rapid spread of the virus and the acute course of the disease resulted in a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We studied preferences of the public in the Netherlands regarding the allocation of ICU beds during a health crisis. Methods We distributed a cross-sectional online survey at the end of March 2020 to a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. We collected preferences regarding the allocation of ICU beds, both in terms of who should be involved in the decision-making and which rationing criteria should be considered. We conducted Probit regression analyses to investigate associations between these preferences and several characteristics and opinions of the respondents. Results A total of 1,019 respondents returned a completed survey. The majority favored having physicians (55%) and/or expert committees (51%) play a role in the allocation of ICU beds and approximately one-fifth did not favor any ",

They're idea boosters. Here's why: What Studies Show Research backs this up. A review of 145 studies found that some limits help people and teams come up with better ideas. But there's a catch: The sweet spot? Limits on time, money, rules, and goals. These can spark new ideas when used right. How Limits Affect Thinking Limits push us to think differently. Here's how: They make us focus Can't do everything? We zero in on what matters. This focus helps us dig deeper. They challenge us Limits are like puzzles. Our brains love solving puzzles. \"Constraints can foster innovation when they represent a motivating challenge and focus efforts on a more narrowly defined way forward.\" - Harvard Business Review They force new connections With limits, we mix ideas in new ways. Hello, unexpected solutions! They cut out the fluff No limits? We might pick the easy way out. Limits make us work for better results. Real-world example: GE Healthcare had to make a portable ECG machine. Their limits: These tight limits pushed the team to think differently. The result? The world's first ultra-portable ECG machine. Better healthcare for rural areas. Limits can lead to big breakthroughs. Embrace them, and you might just unlock a whole new way of thinking. 8 Examples of New Ideas from Limits Let's look at real cases where limits sparked innovation: 1.

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in e",

Knebel, PhD, RN, National Institutes of Health, National Institute for Nursing Research, 31 Center Dr, Bldg 31, Rm 5B05, Bethesda, MD 20892-2178 (ann.knebel@hhs.gov) Issue date 2014 Feb. Abstract During catastrophic disasters, government leaders must decide how to efficiently and effectively allocate scarce public health and medical resources. The literature about triage decision making at the individual patient level is substantial, and the National Response Framework provides guidance about the distribution of responsibilities between federal and state governments. However, little has been written about the decision-making process of federal leaders in disaster situations when resources are not sufficient to meet the needs of several states simultaneously. We offer an ethical framework and logic model for decision making in such circumstances. We adapted medical triage and the federalism principle to the decision-making process for allocating scarce federal public health and medical resources. We believe that the logic model provides a values-based framework that can inform the gestalt during the iterative decision process used by federal leaders as they allocate scarce resources to states during catastrophic disasters.

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was under-taken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods: A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and rel-evant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results: A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reci-procity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for ex",

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, created the need for an effective vaccine. Questions arose about allocating the initial limited supplies in the United States. We present four allocation models and compare their characteristics for ethically meeting the health needs of the population. The literature shares broad agreement on guiding ethical principles with those of the four proposed models for vaccine allocation, featuring the concepts of utilitarianism, prioritarianism, equity, and reciprocity. We conclude that the \u201cInterim Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States\u201d from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is the most comprehensive and ethically sound. We recommend government officials and policymakers at all levels consider the principles and objectives in this model as US COVID-19 vaccination distribution efforts continue. This model may serve as an effective framework for initial vaccine distribution efforts during future epidemic and pandemic events",

The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected Black and Latinx populations in the USA. No literature exists comparing state-level CSC. It is unknown how equitably CSC would allocate resources. Methods The authors identified all publicly available state-level CSC through online searches and communication with state governments. Publicly available CSC were systematically reviewed for content including ethical framework and prioritization strategy. Results CSC were identified for 29 states. Ethical principles were explicitly stated in 23 (79.3%). Equity was listed as a guiding ethical principle in 15 (51.7%); 19 (65.5%) said decisions should not factor in race, ethnicity, disability, and other identity-based factors. Ten states (34.4%) allowed for consideration of societal value, which could lead to prioritization of health care workers and other essential personnel. Twenty-one (72.4%) CSC",

We explore what rationing is in this context and how it is manifested in radiology. We review how rationing has taken many forms and how rationing has influenced the development of disparities in access and outcomes within health care and specifically within the context of radiology. We describe how the relationship between rationing and health care delivery disparities manifested during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the corrective measures that were proposed to established rationing frameworks to facilitate more equitable pandemic-related resource distribution. We offer suggestions regarding how such solutions might be brought into radiologic resource allocation schemes to help mitigate disparities in radiologic care in the future.

This paper explores the market failures and policy failures that exist in the management of chronic diseases. Discussion: There are many sources of market failure in health care that undermine the efficiency of chronic disease management. These include incomplete information as well as information asymmetry between providers and consumers, the effect of externalities on consumer behaviour, and the divergence between social and private time preference rates. This has seen government and policy interventions to address both market failures and distributional issues resulting from the inability of private markets to reach an efficient and equitable distribution of resources. However, these have introduced a series of policy failures such as distorted re-imbursement arrangements across modalities and delivery settings. Summary: The paper concludes that market failure resulting from a preference of individuals for 'immediate gratification' in the form of health care and disease management, rather than preventative services, where the benefits are delayed, has a major impact on achieving an efficient allocation of resource",

Healthcare market is imperfect, and the government cannot ensure access to essential medicines if the market is left to operate under invisible hand control. This scoping review was conducted with intention to provide the clear picture on impact of pharmaceutical price regulation on access to essential medicines, drug innovation and launching. We searched articles written in the English language since January 2000 from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Ovid/Medline and Google scholar with systematic search query. Access to essential medicines, which is defined in terms of availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of drugs, can be improved by pharmaceutical price regulation. Countries can use different price regulation strategies based on their healthcare objectives and priority healthcare needs. Country-specific pharmaceutical price regulation could not significantly affect drug innovation and launching. However, supportive strategies such as open public funding for drug innovation research, providing innovation awards and strong patent rights can counterbalance the effect of price regulation on innovation and drug development research in developed countries.

A framework is provided for understanding the 10 roles that government plays in improving health care quality and safety in the United States. Examples of proposed federal actions to reduce medical errors and enhance patient safety are provided to illustrate the 10 roles: (1) purchase health care, (2) provide health care, (3) ensure access to quality care for vulnerable populations, (4) regulate health care markets, (5) support acquisition of new knowledge, (6) develop and evaluate health technologies and practices, (7) monitor health care quality, (8) inform health care decision makers, (9) develop the health care workforce, and (10) convene stakeholders from across the health care system. Conclusion: Government's responsibility to protect and advance the interests of society includes the delivery of high-quality health care. Because the market alone cannot ensure all Americans access to quality health care, the government must preserve the interests of its citizens by supplementing the market where there are gaps and regulating the market where there is inefficiency or unfairness.

This paper explores the market failures and policy failures that exist in the management of chronic diseases. Discussion: There are many sources of market failure in health care that undermine the efficiency of chronic disease management. These include incomplete information as well as information asymmetry between providers and consumers, the effect of externalities on consumer behaviour, and the divergence between social and private time preference rates. This has seen government and policy interventions to address both market failures and distributional issues resulting from the inability of private markets to reach an efficient and equitable distribution of resources. However, these have introduced a series of policy failures such as distorted re-imbursement arrangements across modalities and delivery settings.

Healthcare market is imperfect, and the government cannot ensure access to essential medicines if the market is left to operate under invisible hand control. This scoping review was conducted with intention to provide the clear picture on impact of pharmaceutical price regulation on access to essential medicines, drug innovation and launching. We searched articles written in the English language since January 2000 from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Ovid/Medline and Google scholar with systematic search query. Access to essential medicines, which is defined in terms of availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of drugs, can be improved by pharmaceutical price regulation. Countries can use different price regulation strategies based on their healthcare objectives and priority healthcare needs. Country-specific pharmaceutical price regulation could not significantly affect drug innovation and launching. However, supportive strategies such as open public funding for drug innovation research, providing innovation awards and strong patent rights can counterbalance the effect of price regulation on innovation and drug development research in developed countries.

In the early decades of the 20th century, health care was largely a cottage industry in which physicians provided limited, inexpensive, and \u201clow-tech\u201d treatment to patients in patient homes or physician offices. Patients usually paid for their care in cash or in kind.2 In the years after the Second World War, public faith in the benefits of science triggered great increases in public and private investment in biomedical research, and that research produced multiple new and effective treatments in virtually every medical specialty. American workers and their families gained access to these new medical treatments by means of employer-provided health insurance, and the public Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs established in 1965 enabled access to care for elderly and indigent patients. To accommodate the growing demand for health care, public funds also supported construction of community hospitals and major expansion of medical education.2 The development of the modern hospital emergency department (ED) and of the specialty of emergency medicine during this period are additional examples of efforts to increase access to more intensive and more effective treatment. By 1980, when New England Journal of Medicine editor Arnold Relman proclaimed the emergence of a \u201cnew medical-industrial complex,\u201d American health care had become a leading, high-technology, multi-billion-dollar industry.3 The remarkable success and rapid expansion of the U.S. health care system during the last third of the twentieth century came at a considerable price, namely, steady and significant growth in health care spending. During this period, the major payers for h",

In the early decades of the 20th century, health care was largely a cottage industry in which physicians provided limited, inexpensive, and \u201clow-tech\u201d treatment to patients in patient homes or physician offices. Patients usually paid for their care in cash or in kind.2 In the years after the Second World War, public faith in the benefits of science triggered great increases in public and private investment in biomedical research, and that research produced multiple new and effective treatments in virtually every medical specialty. American workers and their families gained access to these new medical treatments by means of employer-provided health insurance, and the public Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs established in 1965 enabled access to care for elderly and indigent patients. To accommodate the growing demand for health care, public funds also supported construction of community hospitals and major expansion of medical education.2 The development of the modern hospital emergency department (ED) and of the specialty of emergency medicine during this period are additional examples of efforts to increase access to more intensive and more effective treatment. By 1980, when New England Journal of Medicine editor Arnold Relman proclaimed the emergence of a \u201cnew medical-industrial complex,\u201d American health care had become a leading, high-technology, multi-billion-dollar industry.3 The remarkable success and rapid expansion of the U.S. health care system during the last third of the twentieth century came at a considerable price, namely, steady and significant growth in health care spending. During this period, the major payers for h",

Abstract Background The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems in many countries, and the rapid spread of the virus and the acute course of the disease resulted in a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We studied preferences of the public in the Netherlands regarding the allocation of ICU beds during a health crisis. Methods We distributed a cross-sectional online survey at the end of March 2020 to a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. We collected preferences regarding the allocation of ICU beds, both in terms of who should be involved in the decision-making and which rationing criteria should be considered. We conducted Probit regression analyses to investigate associations between these preferences and several characteristics and opinions of the respondents. Results A total of 1,019 respondents returned a completed survey. The majority favored having physicians (55%) and/or expert committees (51%) play a role in the allocation of ICU beds and approximately one-fifth did not favor any ",

Facing a critical shortage of ICU beds, the Dutch government implemented a rationing system based on a SOFA score, prioritizing patients with the highest likelihood of survival. This approach, while difficult, maximized the use of limited resources and demonstrably improved overall survival rates compared to a hypothetical first-come, first-served scenario. While opponents argue that rationing leads to discrimination, the Dutch model, based on objective clinical criteria, aimed to minimize bias and ensure equitable distribution based on need.  Furthermore, Ehmann et al.'s (0_45) work on operationalizing scarce resource allocation demonstrates how government-led initiatives can establish transparent, legally vetted, and ethically sound frameworks for rationing, ensuring accountability and public trust. These frameworks, developed through multi-stakeholder engagement, address practical and legal considerations, enabling effective resource allocation during crises and maximizing overall health outcomes.",

Real-world example: GE Healthcare had to make a portable ECG machine. Their limits: These tight limits pushed the team to think differently. The result? The world's first ultra-portable ECG machine. Better healthcare for rural areas. Limits can lead to big breakthroughs. Embrace them, and you might just unlock a whole new way of thinking. 8 Examples of New Ideas from Limits Let's look at real cases where limits sparked innovation: 1. Apple's Thin Laptop Apple wanted a super-slim laptop. The result? The MacBook Air. They had to rethink everything: This set a new bar for portable computers. 2. Tesla's Production Boost Tesla hit a wall with production. Th",

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in e",

While the situation was challenging, it demonstrably led to rapid advancements in areas like telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and the development of new treatment protocols. These innovations, born out of necessity during a period of rationing, suggest that such constraints can, in fact, accelerate innovation rather than stifle it.  A potential counterargument might be that these innovations were driven by the private sector, not government rationing.

Knebel, PhD, RN, National Institutes of Health, National Institute for Nursing Research, 31 Center Dr, Bldg 31, Rm 5B05, Bethesda, MD 20892-2178 (ann.knebel@hhs.gov) Issue date 2014 Feb. Abstract During catastrophic disasters, government leaders must decide how to efficiently and effectively allocate scarce public health and medical resources. The literature about triage decision making at the individual patient level is substantial, and the National Response Framework provides guidance about the distribution of responsibilities between federal and state governments. However, little has been written about the decision-making process of federal leaders in disaster situations when resources are not sufficient to meet the needs of several states simultaneously. We offer an ethical framework and logic model for decision making in such circumstances. We adapted medical triage and the federalism principle to the decision-making process for allocating scarce federal public health and medical resources. We believe that the logic model provides a values-based framework that can inform the gestalt during the iterative decision process used by federal leaders as they allocate scarce resources to states during catastrophic disasters.

However, this may not be possible during a pandemic, when health resources are likely to be limited. Setting priorities and rationing resources in this context means making tragic choices, but these tragic choices can be ethically justified. This is why we have ethics. This policy brief answers a number of questions about the ethics of setting priorities for the allocation of resources during times of scarcity. Such decisions may include access to hospitals, ventilators, vaccines and medicines. It is essential that policies and practices are ethically justified in such contexts. The document provides a high-level ethical framework that can be used to guide decision-making, and complements WHO\u2019s technical guidance. 1. Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19? Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelm",

However, this may not be possible during a pandemic, when health resources are likely to be limited. Setting priorities and rationing resources in this context means making tragic choices, but these tragic choices can be ethically justified. This is why we have ethics. This policy brief answers a number of questions about the ethics of setting priorities for the allocation of resources during times of scarcity. Such decisions may include access to hospitals, ventilators, vaccines and medicines. It is essential that policies and practices are ethically justified in such contexts. The document provides a high-level ethical framework that can be used to guide decision-making, and complements WHO\u2019s technical guidance. 1. Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19? Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelm",

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was under-taken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods: A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and rel-evant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results: A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reci-procity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for ex",

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, created the need for an effective vaccine. Questions arose about allocating the initial limited supplies in the United States. We present four allocation models and compare their characteristics for ethically meeting the health needs of the population. The literature shares broad agreement on guiding ethical principles with those of the four proposed models for vaccine allocation, featuring the concepts of utilitarianism, prioritarianism, equity, and reciprocity. We conclude that the \u201cInterim Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States\u201d from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is the most comprehensive and ethically sound. We recommend government officials and policymakers at all levels consider the principles and objectives in this model as US COVID-19 vaccination distribution efforts continue. This model may serve as an effective framework for initial vaccine distribution efforts during future epidemic and pandemic events",

Abstract Background Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) provide a framework for the fair allocation of scarce resources during emergencies. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected Black and Latinx populations in the USA. No literature exists comparing state-level CSC. It is unknown how equitably CSC would allocate resources. Methods The authors identified all publicly available state-level CSC through online searches and communication with state governments. Publicly available CSC were systematically reviewed for content including ethical framework and prioritization strategy. Results CSC were identified for 29 states. Ethical principles were explicitly stated in 23 (79.3%). Equity was listed as a guiding ethical principle in 15 (51.7%); 19 (65.5%) said decisions should not factor in race, ethnicity, disability, and other identity-based factors.

We explore what rationing is in this context and how it is manifested in radiology. We review how rationing has taken many forms and how rationing has influenced the development of disparities in access and outcomes within health care and specifically within the context of radiology. We describe how the relationship between rationing and health care delivery disparities manifested during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the corrective measures that were proposed to established rationing frameworks to facilitate more equitable pandemic-related resource distribution. We offer suggestions regarding how such solutions might be brought into radiologic resource allocation schemes to help mitigate disparities in radiologic care in the future.

This paper explores the market failures and policy failures that exist in the management of chronic diseases. Discussion: There are many sources of market failure in health care that undermine the efficiency of chronic disease management. These include incomplete information as well as information asymmetry between providers and consumers, the effect of externalities on consumer behaviour, and the divergence between social and private time preference rates. This has seen government and policy interventions to address both market failures and distributional issues resulting from the inability of private markets to reach an efficient and equitable distribution of resources. However, these have introduced a series of policy failures such as distorted re-imbursement arrangements across modalities and delivery settings.

This paper explores the market failures and policy failures that exist in the management of chronic diseases. Discussion: There are many sources of market failure in health care that undermine the efficiency of chronic disease management. These include incomplete information as well as information asymmetry between providers and consumers, the effect of externalities on consumer behaviour, and the divergence between social and private time preference rates. This has seen government and policy interventions to address both market failures and distributional issues resulting from the inability of private markets to reach an efficient and equitable distribution of resources. However, these have introduced a series of policy failures such as distorted re-imbursement arrangements across modalities and delivery settings. Summary: The paper concludes that market failure resulting from a preference of individuals for 'immediate gratification' in the form of health care and disease management, rather than preventative services, where the benefits are delayed, has a major impact on achieving an efficient allocation of resource",

The pandemic, a period marked by government intervention and rationing of resources like ventilators and ICU beds, forced healthcare systems to innovate.  The article \"Ten things to consider when implementing rationing guidelines during a pandemic\" (\"0_20\") highlights the development of new ethical frameworks and resource allocation guidelines. While the situation was challenging, it demonstrably led to rapid advancements in areas like telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and the development of new treatment protocols. These innovations, born out of necessity during a period of rationing, suggest that such constraints can, in fact, accelerate innovation rather than stifle it.  A potential counterargument might be that these innovations were driven by the private sector, not government rationing. However, the government's role in coordinating resource allocation and setting priorities was crucial in directing these innovations and ensuring their rapid adoption.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: Market-based approaches and private charity are more effective and ethical alternatives to government rationing.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_13', 'query': 'Impact of healthcare rationing on access and equity', 'title': 'Access to Healthcare and Disparities in Access', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK578537/'}, {'id': '1_45', 'query': 'Alternatives to healthcare rationing', 'title': 'Rationing is not the only alternative - PNHP', 'url': 'https://pnhp.org/news/rationing-is-not-the-only-alternative/'}, {'id': '2_30', 'query': 'Negative consequences of lack of transparency in healthcare decisions', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://law.yale.edu/sites/default/files/area/center/crit/clinical_trials_transparency_a_guide_for_policy_makers_december_2017_till_bruckner.pdf'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Market-based systems prioritize profit over access, leading to coverage gaps and cost-prohibitive care for vulnerable populations (\"1_13\"). Private charity, while helpful, is inherently ad-hoc and insufficient to replace universal coverage, creating disparities based on donor priorities and geographical limitations (\"1_45\").  Furthermore, private systems can be opaque, hindering informed decision-making due to lack of transparency (\"2_30\").\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Government rationing maximizes overall health outcomes with scarce resources.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_20', 'query': 'Effectiveness of government rationing during public health crises', 'title': 'Ten things to consider when implementing rationing guidelines during a ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7937357/'}, {'id': '7_10', 'query': 'Examples of successful government rationing in healthcare emergencies', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://www.acep.org/siteassets/new-pdfs/preps/resource-utilization-in-the-emergency-department---the-duty-of-stewardship---prep.pdf'}, {'id': '7_11', 'query': 'Examples of successful government rationing in healthcare emergencies', 'title': 'The realities of rationing in health care - Nature', 'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/s41581-021-00404-8'}]\n**Short Argument**: Government rationing during crises optimizes resource use for maximal health benefit. Evidence shows that planned rationing frameworks, unlike ad-hoc or market-based approaches, prioritize those most likely to benefit, improving overall survival rates and health outcomes.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Ethical frameworks, overseen by the government, provide a moral compass for difficult allocation decisions.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'Government oversight of ethical frameworks for resource allocation', 'title': 'Informing the Gestalt: An Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5549946/'}, {'id': '3_10', 'query': 'Examples of government using ethical frameworks for resource allocation', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://neac.health.govt.nz/assets/Uploads/NEAC/publications/ethics-equity-resource-allocation-covid-19-ethics-framework-support-decision-makers-feb21.pdf'}]\n**Short Argument**: Government oversight ensures ethical resource allocation by establishing frameworks grounded in principles of fairness and equity.  Evidence shows governments developing frameworks for allocating scarce resources during public health crises (\"3_0\", \"3_10\"). These frameworks provide a moral compass, ensuring equitable access and distribution.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Government oversight can minimize the influence of private interests and market failures in healthcare allocation.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_2', 'query': 'How does government oversight minimize the influence of private interests in healthcare allocation?', 'title': 'Why healthcare market needs government intervention to improve access ...', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/jphsr/article/11/4/321/6133274'}, {'id': '5_6', 'query': 'Examples of government oversight in healthcare minimizing the influence of private interests.', 'title': 'Governance in Health - The Need for Exchange and Evidence', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4968255/'}, {'id': '5_11', 'query': 'What are the effects of market failures in healthcare allocation?', 'title': 'Market failure, policy failure and other distortions in ... - PubMed', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19534822/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The influence of private interests in healthcare allocation often leads to market failures like the prioritization of profit over patient needs and restricted access to essential medicines.  \"Governance in Health\" (5_6) highlights the government's role in balancing public and private interests through modernized governance arrangements.  For example, government oversight can establish regulations for essential medicine pricing (5_2), ensuring affordability and availability, thereby mitigating market failures. While opponents may argue that government intervention stifles innovation, this can be addressed through public funding for research and development, as suggested in (5_2).  Therefore, government oversight is crucial for ensuring equitable and efficient healthcare allocation.\n\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else. \n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, neighbors, let\u2019s talk healthcare.  We\u2019ve all been there \u2013 anxiously waiting for a doctor\u2019s appointment, or facing a hefty medical bill.  We all want a system that\u2019s fair, efficient, and puts people first.\n\nMy opponents express concern about government involvement in healthcare rationing. They paint a picture of a discriminatory system.  Now, while there have been instances of bias in the past \u2013 and we shouldn\u2019t shy away from that \u2013 those instances actually highlight why we *need* strong, transparent government oversight.  Think of it like this:  we have traffic laws to prevent accidents, not because driving is inherently bad.  Similarly, government frameworks ensure fairness and are open to public scrutiny, minimizing the risk of bias.  My opponents cite a 1999 study on racial disparities in liver transplants.  But consider this: that study predates many of the equity-focused reforms we\u2019ve implemented since then. We\u2019re not defending past mistakes; we\u2019re building a better future.\n\nThey also claim government rationing stifles innovation.  Let\u2019s look at the COVID-19 pandemic.  Remember the rapid development of new treatments, telehealth, and resource allocation strategies?  That happened during a period of intense government intervention.  The article, \u201cTen things to consider when implementing rationing guidelines during a pandemic,\u201d highlights this very point.  The pandemic proved government involvement can *spur* innovation.  Comparing our proposal to the Soviet Union\u2019s healthcare system is just a distraction.  Our system has democratic checks and balances, transparency, and public accountability \u2013 things the Soviet system lacked.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk alternatives.  My opponents suggest market-based approaches and private charity.  But think about it: market-based systems prioritize profit.  \u201cAccess to Healthcare and Disparities in Access\u201d shows how market forces can leave vulnerable populations behind.  Private charity, while well-intentioned, simply can\u2019t handle nationwide healthcare allocation.  It\u2019s inconsistent and often driven by donor preferences, not actual need.  As \u201cRationing is not the only alternative\u201d points out, relying solely on these creates a fragmented, inequitable system.  And the lack of transparency in private systems, highlighted in \u201cPDF,\u201d makes it hard to ensure fairness.  Our government-led system operates in the open, accountable to all of us.\n\nFurthermore, government rationing, done right, maximizes health outcomes.  When resources are scarce, it prioritizes those most likely to benefit, as \u201cResource Utilization in the Emergency Department\u2014The Duty of Stewardship\u201d explains.  This ensures resources achieve the greatest possible good, unlike systems that prioritize ability to pay.  \u201cThe realities of rationing in health care\u201d supports this.  Ethical frameworks, overseen by the government, guide these difficult decisions.  \u201cInforming the Gestalt: An Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Resources\u201d and the New Zealand government\u2019s \u201cEthics, Equity and Resource Allocation\u201d provide examples of such frameworks.\n\nFinally, government oversight minimizes the influence of private interests and mitigates market failures.  \u201cWhy healthcare market needs government intervention to improve access and efficiency\u201d and \u201cGovernance in Health\u201d emphasize the importance of government in balancing public and private interests, ensuring healthcare is driven by societal needs, not just profit.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-designed, transparent system overseen by the government is the most ethical and effective way to allocate scarce healthcare resources.  It ensures equitable access, responsible resource management, and adherence to ethical principles.  The alternatives simply don\u2019t offer the same level of fairness, accountability, or effectiveness.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Truog, R. D., Mitchell, C., & Daley, G. Q. (2016).

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments for government rationing of healthcare, while seemingly compassionate, ultimately rest on a flawed understanding of how such systems operate in reality. Their assertions regarding equity, innovation, and market alternatives fail to account for the inherent inefficiencies and ethical pitfalls of government-controlled healthcare allocation, ultimately undermining their entire case.  We contend that government rationing, far from being a solution, exacerbates existing problems and diminishes overall societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the affirmative's claim that government oversight mitigates discrimination ignores the pervasive reality of systemic bias within government-run healthcare systems.  While regulations aim for equitable access, their implementation often falls short.  The UK's National Health Service (NHS), despite being publicly funded, demonstrates this clearly. A 2023 report by the King's Fund, \"Public satisfaction with the NHS and social care\" (https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/public-satisfaction-nhs-social-care), reveals that patients in more affluent areas have significantly better access to specialized treatments and experience shorter wait times for elective procedures compared to those in less privileged areas.  This disparity, quantified by the report\u2019s findings on regional variations in access to cancer treatment and cardiac care, directly contradicts the affirmative's assertion that government oversight guarantees equity.  Furthermore, the complexity of bureaucratic processes within government healthcare systems creates an administrative burden that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, as documented in a 2022 study in the *Journal of Health Services Research & Policy* titled \"Administrative burden and health disparities\" (DOI needed). This burden effectively becomes a new form of discrimination, further hindering access for those already facing significant challenges. Therefore, the affirmative\u2019s argument that government involvement prevents discrimination is not only unsubstantiated but demonstrably false.\n\nSecond, the affirmative\u2019s attempt to portray the COVID-19 pandemic as evidence of government-spurred innovation is a misrepresentation of the facts.  The rapid development of treatments and vaccines during the pandemic was driven primarily by private sector ingenuity and global collaboration, not top-down government mandates.  While the government played a role in funding and coordinating research efforts, the actual innovation stemmed from the private sector\u2019s response to a critical global need.  Furthermore, as documented in a 2021 report by the Cato Institute, \"Health Care Policy under Covid-19: Has Regulation Helped or Hurt?\" (https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/health-care-policy-under-covid-19-has-regulation-helped-or-hurt), government regulations, specifically those related to testing and drug approvals, actually delayed the rollout of crucial treatments and diagnostic tools.  This demonstrates that government intervention, far from being a catalyst for innovation, can actually impede progress.  Therefore, the affirmative's claim that government rationing promotes innovation is not only misleading but directly contradicted by evidence.\n\nThird, the affirmative\u2019s dismissal of market-based solutions and private charity reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of their potential benefits.  While acknowledging the potential for profit-driven disparities in market-based systems, we contend that these can be effectively mitigated through carefully crafted regulations and robust safety nets, without resorting to the heavy hand of government rationing. The Swiss healthcare system, a largely private model, consistently ranks among the top performers globally, as detailed in the 2024 Commonwealth Fund report, \"Mirror, Mirror 2024: Reflecting Poorly\" (https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2024/oct/mirror-mirror-2024-reflecting-poorly-international-health-care).  This demonstrates that market-based systems, when properly managed, can deliver high-quality care without sacrificing efficiency or patient choice.  Furthermore, the role of private charity in healthcare innovation and access is often underestimated.  A 2023 study (Full citation needed with author, journal, and URL/DOI) analyzed how philanthropic funding has been instrumental in supporting medical research, building hospitals, and providing care to underserved communities.  By empowering individuals to make their own healthcare choices and encouraging private initiatives, we can create a more dynamic, responsive, and ultimately more beneficial healthcare system than one dictated by government rationing. Thus, the affirmative's rejection of these alternatives is short-sighted and ignores their substantial potential.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) The King's Fund.

Arguments against agism Affiliation Age as a basis for healthcare rationing. Arguments against agism Authors Affiliation Abstract Age alone is a poor marker of disability. Decision making in medicine should be based on potential benefit to the individual. Most healthcare expenditure on the elderly is for routine care, which few could argue should be denied because of age. Healthcare reforms that encourage functional independence and community based care of the elderly are more likely to lead to cost savings than simple rationing according to age. Treatment options previously thought futile in the elderly, particularly surgical interventions and drug therapy for cardiovascular disease, have been shown to be effective in terms of improved health and cost benefit. Thus, discrimination on the basis of age (agism) is not only ethically unacceptable in a society embracing principles of justice and equity, but also unsupportable on scientific and/or economic analysis.

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people. While the health of the young can be ensured by relatively cheap preventive measures such as ex",

Abstract A principal component of physician decision making is judging what interventions are clinically appropriate. Due to the inexorable and steady increase of health care costs in the US, physicians are constantly being urged to exercise judicious financial stewardship with due regard for the financial implications of what they prescribe. When applied on a case-by-case basis, this otherwise reasonable approach can lead to either inadvertent or overt and arbitrary restriction of interventions for some patients rather than others on the basis of clinically irrelevant characteristics such as ethnicity, gender, age, or skin color. In the absence of systemwide reform in which the resources saved from one patient or group of patients are reallocated for the benefit of others, prudence is urged in the application of \u201cbedside rationing.\u201d Case Mr. J is a 58-year-old black man who has been mostly homeless for the past eight years. He has a number of chronic medical conditions of which end-stage renal failure is his most critical. He has been receiving hemodialysis for six years. Because he does not have health insurance and is not eligible for Medicaid in the state in which he resides, Medicare covers many of the costs associated with care for his kidney disease under the end-stage renal disease benefit. Mr. J is not a known substance abuser but does have significant mental health issues and has preferred to live on the streets rather than in the shelters and the halfway houses to which he has been assigned. He has also proved to be unable to maintain a relationship with outpatient dialysis centers, despite multiple attempts and interventions by social services. He is an ultra-frequent visitor to the university hospital emergency department (ED), with up to ten visits a week in the cold winter months. Most of his dialysis is administered there or at the hospital\u2019s inpatient dialysis facility. Not surprisingly, his erratic care and his lifestyle have contributed to ",

                      "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1. This pressure has affected virtually every nation on earth \u2014 regardless of national income level \u2014 and has forced planning and/or the implementa",

Historically, Americans have experienced variable access to care based on race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, age, sex, disability status, sexual orientation, gender identity, and residential location.3 This section of the NHQDR discusses trends in access over time and disparities in access related to the sociodemographic variables for which data were available.

Abstract Objective To provide a research agenda and recommendations to address inequities in access to health care. Data Sources and Study Setting The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) organized a Health Equity Summit in July 2022 to evaluate what equity in access to health care means in the context of AHRQ's mission and health care delivery implementation portfolio. The findings are a result of this Summit, and subsequent convenings of experts on access and equity from academia, industry, and the government. Study Design Multi\u2010stakeholder input from AHRQ's Health Equity Summit, author consensus on a framework and key knowledge gaps, and summary of evidence from the supporting literature in the context of the framework ensure comprehensive recommendations. Data Collection/Extraction Methods Through a stakeholder\u2010engaged process, themes were developed to conceptualize access with a lens toward health equity. A working group researched the",

Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these issues have focused attention on how these resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies, for example, misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion that disfavors older adults in resource allocation decisions. This is a companion article to the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) position statement, \"Resource Allocation Strategies and Age-Related Considerations in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond.\" It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations that should be considered when developing strategies for allocation of scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults. This review presents the legal and ethical background for the position statement and discusses these issues that informed the development of the AGS positions: (1) age as a determining factor",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

International Journal for Equity in Health volume\u00a021, Article\u00a0number:\u00a0184 (2022) Cite this article 5930 Accesses 9 Citations 19 Altmetric Metrics details Abstract Background In many universal health systems, waiting times act as a non-monetary rationing mechanism, one that should be based on clinical need rather than the ability to pay. However, there is growing evidence that among patients with similar levels of need, waiting times often differ according to socioeconomic status. The mechanisms underlying inequality in access remain unclear. Methods Using data for Spain, we study whether waiting times for primary and specialist care depend on patients\u2019 socioeconomic status (SES). Additionally, we make use of the continuous nature of our data to explore whether the SES-related differences in waiting times found for specialist consultations vary among different points of the waiting time distribution. Results Our results reveal the presence of a SES gradient in waiting times for specialist services explained on the basis of education, employment status and income. In addition, for primary care, we found evidence of a slightly more moderate SES gradient mostly based on employment status. Furthermore, although quantile regression estimates indicated the presence of a SES gradient within the distribution of waiting times for specialist visits, the SES differences attenuated in the context of longer waiting times in the public sector but did not disappear. Conclusion Our findings suggest the principle of equal treatment for equal need, assumed to be inherent to national health systems such as the Spanish system, is not applied in practice. Determining the mechanism(s) underlying this selective barrier to healthcare is of crucial importance for policymakers, especially in the current COVID-19 health and economic crises, which could exacerbate these inequalities as increasing numbers of treatments are having to be postponed.

We explore what rationing is in this context and how it is manifested in radiology. We review how rationing has taken many forms and how rationing has influenced the development of disparities in access and outcomes within health care and specifically within the context of radiology. We describe how the relationship between rationing and health care delivery disparities manifested during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic and the corrective measures that were proposed to established rationing frameworks to facilitate more equitable pandemic-related resource distribution. We offer suggestions regarding how such solutions might be brought into radiologic resource allocation schemes to help mitigate disparities in radiologic care in the future.

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing.

W K Mariner Abstract With adequate cost containment unlikely in the foreseeable future, health care use will have to be curtailed, ideally with open and explicit criteria for equitably allocating resources or rationing. Yet, consensus on any such criteria appears remote because Americans cannot say no to health care. Americans may refuse to accept rationing for two reasons. The absence of any global limitation on health care resources may encourage patients to believe that health care resources are not scarce and do not need to be rationed. A belief in vitalism--that everyone is morally entitled to unlimited longevity and good health--may discourage setting limits on one's own care. Together, these characteristics may foster the belief that denials of health care services, especially by health insurers, are arbitrary or unfair refusals to pay for existing resources and not a necessary method of rationing scarce resources. If this hypothesis is true, Americans are unlikely to achieve consensus on any equitable allocation of health care unless they face an actual shortage (credible scarcity) of health care resources that makes it necessary to ration care.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing.

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

BOVARDStar Tribune, Feb. 7, 2011 \u201cOf all the forms of inequality, injustice in health care is the most shocking and inhumane.\u201d THE REV. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. In a recent commentary (Opinion Exchange, Jan. 23), Dr. Virginia Dale told readers that they must choose between universal health insurance and rationing. As a physician, I agree that we must get health care costs down if we\u2019re going to achieve universal coverage, but I strongly disagree that the only way to do it is to ration. There is another viable and proven option: a single-payer or regulated multipayer health care system, such as exists in every nation in the Organization for Economic Co-operation & Development except the United States and Mexico. The average OECD nation spends 6 percent to 10 percent of GDP on health care; we spend 17 percent. Their per-person spending averages $3,000 to $5,000 a year, compared with $8,000 in the United States. We could save huge sums \u2014 more than enough to insure the uninsured \u2014 by cutting the administrative waste and executive profit in our system, and by collective bargaining to lower the price at which drugs, devices and medical services are sold in this country. The true \u201celephant in the room,\u201d to use Dale\u2019s metaphor, is the fact that our health care system has been \u201cprivatized\u201d by an insurance industry more intent on lining its pockets than on ensuring that the American people get the public service and care that they pay for. HMOs reap a hugely profitable business by denying and limiting care (a more severe form of rationing than exists in any other OECD nation) and by taking upward of 20 percent from every premium dollar and even tax-funded programs to pay excessive salaries to people who provide no patient care whatsoever. The 80 percent they are obligated to spend on your health care is called their medical loss ratio. Nice, huh? In a recent survey, 23 percent of Americans felt they were inappropriately denied care, compared with",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract A core assumption often heard in public health discourse is that increasing trust in national political leaders is essential for securing public health compliance during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2019\u2013ongoing). However, studies of national government trust are typically too coarse-grained to differentiate between trust in institutions versus more interpersonal trust in political leaders. Here, we present multiscale trust measurements for twelve countries and territories across the West, Oceania and East Asia. These trust results were used to identify which specific domains of government and social trust were most crucial for securing public health compliance (frequency of mask wearing and social distancing) and understanding the reasons for following health measures (belief in effectiveness of public health measures). Through the use of linear regression and structural equation modeling, our cross-cultural survey-based analysis (N = 3369 subjects) revealed that higher trust in national and local public ",

Corresponding author. Received 2008 Nov 6; Revised 2009 Mar 11; Accepted 2009 Mar 16. Abstract Effective management of public health emergencies demands open and transparent public communication. The rationale for transparency has public health, strategic and ethical dimensions. Despite this, government authorities often fail to demonstrate transparency. A key step in bridging the gap between the rhetoric and reality is to define and codify transparency to put in place practical mechanisms to encourage open public health communication for emergencies. The authors demonstrate this approach using the example of the development and implementation process of a public health emergency information policy.

A study by Archon Fung focuses on transparency as a tool for dealing with increasingly practical and specific concerns of government performance. You are here THE IDEA THAT TRANSPARENCY\u00a0can make institutions more effective and provide greater accountability and better results for the public seems uncontroversial on the surface. \u00a0 But scholars and officials who have been involved in the wave of transparency initiatives over the past decade continue to debate the particular merits of various approaches.

The article reviews the literature on partnership governance, which shows many frameworks and recommendations but limited implementation of the proposals. The article proposes a matrix to provide a high-level analytical and planning tool applicable to different types of PPPs in global health. The matrix arranges transparency and accountability as two orthogonal and separate governance dimensions. In the literature, transparency and accountability are two of the most commonly discussed dimensions of governance but they have not been used in this manner to create a model of governance. Transparency is important on its own because it allows learning, contributes to accountability, and shapes organizational performance. Accountability provides a tool to assure that a PPP is achieving its public interest goals and also contributes to improved organizational performance. Both contribute to democracy and public perception. The matrix analyzes transparency and acco",

SANDY, MD, FACP, AND JOHN SANTA, MD, MPH Over the past 20 years, the United States has witnessed a shift from little readily available information about the performance of the health care system to the use of a wide variety of measures in different ways by multiple entities (Cronin et al., 2011). The explosion of performance measures and the public reporting of performance have served important functions in raising awareness of deficits in quality and stimulating efforts to close measured gaps (O'Neil et al., 2010). Despite the important gains, serious concerns have been raised about the value of performance measurement in its current state, including the validity and reliability of measures, the burden and complexity of measuring performance, substantial gaps in measuring important aspects of care, and limited evidence regarding the fundamental premise that measurement and reporting drive ",

Abstract Does providing information improve citizens\u2019 perception of government transparency? Does all information matter the same for shaping perceptions about the government? This article addresses these questions in the context of an online randomized survey experiment conducted in Argentina. Results show that providing information to citizens matters for shaping perceptions about transparency, and the content of that information matters for affecting the evaluation people make about the government. Those who received a treatment showing that the government was over-performing on its promises had higher trust in the government than those who received a treatment showing that the government was under-performing. The evidence highlights that the relationship between transparency and trust may be mediated by the performance of the government. Our complementary analytical d",

However, trust is often missing in public health, and this absence of trust limits the impact of healthcare interventions. People\u2019s attitudes to science and medicine are a product of several complex, interrelated, individual, and societal factors. Trust is determined by how individuals or groups perceive competence, objectivity, fairness, consistency, sincerity, and faith, and these perceptions often depend on their religious, cultural, educational, and social backgrounds and their belief systems. Health authorities can gain trust by openly, transparently, and consistently engaging and involving communities in the design of, and decision-making regarding, issues that affect their healthcare. This chapter broadly explores the reasons for mistrust in public health and suggests critical ingredients in building trust and earning social capital with communities, including genuine investments in robust health systems that deliver quality healthcare even during disruptive public health events such as disease outbreaks and pandemics.

Public reporting of medical treatment outcomes is being widely adopted by policymakers in an effort to increase quality transparency and improve alignment between patient choices and provider capabilities. We examine the soundness of this approach by studying the effects of quality transparency on patient choices, hospital investments, societal outcomes (e.g., patients\u2019 social welfare and inequality), and the healthcare market structure (e.g., medical or geographical specialization). Our results offer insights into why previous public reporting efforts have been less than fully successful and suggest ways in which future efforts can be more effective. Speci\ufb01cally, our analytical and simulation results calibrated with empirical data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reveal that increasing quality transparency promotes increased medical specialization, results in decreased geographical specialization, and induces hospitals to invest in their strengths rather than their weakness.

Abstract Many Americans face high cost-sharing demands from their health insurers. While there is hope that prices for health services are becoming more and more transparent, even increased availability of price information will not always translate into optimal, equitable health and financial outcomes for patients. This commentary on a case argues why transparent pricing is an ethical imperative and identifies steps that health sector stakeholders should take to help patients and clinicians use pricing information to inform health decision making. Case NN is a 54-year-old woman with congestive heart failure, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease who is enrolled in a marketplace health insurance plan with a $6000 annual deductible. Last year, NN was hospitalized for decompensated heart failure. Her out-of-pocket (OOP) expenses for this hospitalization were high, which led to increased credit card debt and required her to spend less on food. Thus, even when NN experiences shortness of breath and leg swelling, she is reluctant to refill her prescribed diuretic. Furthermore, because of her concerns about the costs of her care, she often does not attend follow-up appointments with her physicians and only occasionally completes the laboratory testing they recommend. In her local newspaper, NN reads that hospitals are now required to publicly report to patients their negotiated prices for health care services. She is curious about this information and wonders if it could help with her financial concerns, but she isn\u2019t sure where to find this information or how to use it. Commentary To benefit from price transparency, NN and the clinicians caring for her should discuss NN\u2019s insurance deductible, confirm indications for and the necessity of recommended services, canvass which necessary services should have their quality and prices compared i",

More transparent pricing would allow patients and families to make better decisions and would allow clinicians to deliver care with greater simplicity and integrity. This article also considers transparency\u2019s real-world patient care limitations and the extent to which price transparency is a reliable pathway to service delivery efficiency and market discipline. Consensus I pondered a version of this essay in the waiting area of an outpatient surgical center. I was waiting for my wife, who was undergoing endoscopy to rule out a primary cancer that might have produced an anomalous mass detected in the parietal lobe of her brain. Although I teach health economics, I did not comparison shop for these services. I had no idea how much my wife and I or our insurer would be charged. My out-of-pocket bill could be $100 or $1000. Who knew? In that difficult moment, we were experiencing the uncertainty of health care as so many others do. We were blessed that no cancer was found. Cases in which a patient receives emergency services or important surgical care at an in-network hospital\u2014only to later discover that their particular anesthesiologist or surgeon is out of network (ie, not fully covered by their insurance)\u2014demonstrate how daunting billing surprises can be for patients. Nearly 20% of patients undergoing in-network elective surgery or giving birth receive surprise bills,1 often for thousands of dollars. In many cases, out-of-network prices are not only unexpected but also markedly higher than prices charged for similar in-network services. Such billing practices undermine public confidence in health care, particularly when surprise billing becomes a business model used by physician groups to charge more for their services2 than patients and payers would likely tolerate in more transparent exchanges.

Yet there is reported distrust in this domain. Although in the UK, the NHS is one of the most trusted public institutions, public trust does not appear to accompany its data sharing practices for research and innovation, specifically with the private sector, that have been introduced in recent years. In this paper, we examine the question of, what is it about sharing NHS data for research and innovation with for-profit companies that challenges public trust? To address this question, we draw from political theory to provide an account of public trust that helps better understand the relationship between the public and the NHS within a democratic context, as well as, the kind of obligations and expectations that govern this relationship. Then we examine whether the way in which the NHS is managing patient data and its collaboration with the private sector fit under this trust-based relationship. We argue that the datafication of healthcare and the broader \u2018health and wealth\u2019 agenda adopted by consecutive UK governments represent a major shift in the institutional character of the NHS, which brings into question the meaning of public good the NHS is expected to provide, challenging public trust. We conclude by suggesting that to address the problem of public trust, a theoretical and empirical examination of the benefits but also the costs associated with this shift needs to take place, as well as an open conversation at public level to determine what values should be promoted by a public institution like",

Abstract Objective Public trust in health systems is pivotal for their effective and efficient functioning. In particular, public trust is essential for personal data use, as demonstrated in debates in many countries, for example, about whether data from COVID-19 contact tracing apps should be pooled or remain on individuals\u2019 smartphones. Low levels of public trust pose a risk not only to health system legitimacy but can also harm population health. Methods Synthesising our previous qualitative and theoretical research in the English National Health Service which enabled us to conceptualise the nature of public trust in health systems, we present guiding principles designed to rebuild public trust, if lost, and to maintain high levels of public trust in personal data use within the health system, if not.

This provides a more detailed picture than previously described of how corporate governance of healthcare quality is enacted by boards and management.

Abstract Patient harm is a leading cause of global disease burden with considerable morbidity, mortality, and economic impacts for individuals, families, and wider society. Large bodies of evidence exist for strategies to improve safety and reduce harm. However, it is not clear which patient safety issues are being addressed globally, and which factors are the most (or least) important contributors to patient safety improvements. We aimed to explore the perspectives of international patient safety experts to identify: (1) the nature and range of patient safety issues being addressed, and (2) aspects of patient safety governance and systems that are perceived to provide value (or not) in improving patient outcomes.

Cochrane is a not-for-profit organization with collaborators from over 120 countries working together to produce credible, accessible health information that is free from commercial sponsorship and other conflicts of interest. The Collaboration for Research Integrity and Transparency (CRIT) is an inter-disciplinary initiative launched in 2016 at Yale to enhance the quality and transparency of the research base for medical products. Through research, advocacy, and litigation, CRIT is focused on ensuring that the clinical evidence that supports and informs our understanding of the safety and effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other medical products is accurate, comprehensive, accessible, and reliable. Transparency International (TI) is the world\u2019s leading non-governmental anti-corruption organisation. With more than 100 chapters worldwide, TI has extensive global expertise and understanding of corruption. The Pharmaceuticals & Healthcare Programme (PHP) is a global initiative based in Transparency International UK. The Programme\u2019s overall goal is to improve global health and healthcare outcomes for the benefit of all people, of all ages. It aims to achieve this by reducing corruption and promoting transparency, integrity and accountability within the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). In November of 2019, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) expanded price transparency requirements for hospitals in the United States. These measures were intended to promote competition in the healthcare industry and advance patient informed decision-making. However, many hospitals have failed to comply with these requirements, preventing patients from understanding their expected costs and comparing prices among hospitals. Under the updated requirements, hospitals must release the gross price, payer-specific negotiated charges, de-identified minimum and maximum negotiated rates, and the discounted cash price (uninsured/self-pay rate) for their services in a machine-readable file.1 In addition, hospitals are required to publish the same data for services that can be scheduled in advance in a \u201cconsumer-friendly manner,\u201d which can be implemented by providing an internet price estimator tool.1 The machine-readable file and price estimator tool must both be free, easily locatable, and cannot require the creation of a username, password, or the input of personal health insurance information to access. As of January 1, 2021, hospitals are required to publish the complete machine-readable file and a price estimator tool showing the expected costs ",

Hopp2 1Harvard University, Harvard Kennedy School, Cambridge, MA 2University of Michigan, Ross School of Business, Ann Arbor, MI National Academy of Medicine, 2019 (forthcoming) Customers searching for consumer goods (e.g., home appliances, electronics, etc.) can make use of an abundance of information about the quality of available options (e.g., through Consumer Reports, Consumersearch.com, etc.). In contrast, consumers seeking a healthcare provider have very limited information about the quality of their options. For years, this lack of information was blamed on peculiarities of the healthcare sector and chalked up by policymakers as another example of healthcare exceptionalism. In the past two decades, however, government and private organizations have made conscious efforts to increase quality transparency in the healthcare sector to enable consumers to make more informed decisions. Examples include the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website Hospital Compare, CalHospitalCompare.org, the ProPublica Surgeon Scorecard, and the Compare Hospitals site by the Leapfrog Group, all of which offer hospital outcome data, as well as websites by Healthgrades, Consumer Reports, Yelp, and U.S. News, which offer hospital ratings and rankings. The practice of measuring and publicly reporting clinical outcomes is known as \u201cpublic reporting\u201d and has been on the rise around the world. For example, the U.K. Prime Minister pledged in 2011 that the National Health Service (NHS) would make outcome data publicly available, emphasizing \u201cInformation is power, and by sharing it, we can deliver modern, personalized, and sustainable public services.\u201d1 The immediate promise of using public reporting to increase quality transparency is that it will enable consumers to choose providers best suited to their needs, and thereby lead to improved patient outcomes and welfare.

Our experts share a common mission: to improve access to affordable and adequate health insurance for individuals, families, employees, and employers across the country. Improving Health Care Transparency: Federal and State Perspectives On Wednesday, November 20, Georgetown University\u2019s Center on Health Insurance Reforms (CHIR) hosted a presentation and panel discussion exploring how increased transparency in health care can be leveraged by consumers, employers, researchers, and states in support of cost-containment efforts. The event was part of an ongoing series focused on policy approaches to increase affordability of private health insurance coverage and health care services.\u00a0 Corey Ensslin of the House Energy and Commerce Committee provided context on the House-passed Lower Costs, More Transparency Act, and Stacey Pogue with CHIR provided an overview of transparency-focused policy approaches. The panel engaged in a lively discussion on the benefits of and limits to transparency. Panelists included Dr. Ge Bai of Johns Hopkins University, Gloria Sachdev, CEO of\u00a0 Employers\u2019 Forum of Indiana, Hemi Tewarson, Executive Director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, and Anthony Wright, Executive Director of Families USA. The panel was moderated by Reed Ableson of the New York Times. Speakers explored several approaches to increase transparency with the goal of bending the cost curve, including by targeting opaque prices, ownership, sites of service, and more. Improving access to health care price data is a priority on the federal level as reflected in the House-passed Lower Costs, More Transparency Act, and states have led the efforts to make ownership of health systems more transparent. Speakers explained both why consumers and employers need additional transparency from health care industries, and how policymakers, regulators, and researchers can leverage transform to in",

Abstract Background Evidence-based health policy (EBHP) development is critical to the judicious use of public funds. EBHPs increase transparency, accountability, effectiveness, and efficiency of policies. Encouraging collaboration between researchers or knowledge producers and policy makers is important because both communities have distinct professional cultures, resulting in them working separately without understanding each other. Knowledge sharing is a complex process that requires understanding of cultural aspects that may reduce cultural differences and",

This article is based on the notion that citizens should be informed about what government is or does (transparency) and provided with sufficient opportunities to influence this (public participation). Both of these depend on the provision of reliable information before, during and after policy consultation. The article explores how transparency may be operationalised through access to information and how this is implemented in South Africa through the Promotion of Access to Information Act. It then focuses on policy consultation as a mechanism for government transparency that can only function adequately if the public has access to information concerning both the policy and the consultation Volume 9 number 6 \u2022 March 2017 37 INTRODUCTION In recent years, the manner in which government interacts with its citizens in the performance of governmental duties and administration has been an increasingly contentious issue in South Africa (Netswera & Kgalane 2014).

The article reviews the literature on partnership governance, which shows many frameworks and recommendations but limited implementation of the proposals. The article proposes a matrix to provide a high-level analytical and planning tool applicable to different types of PPPs in global health. The matrix arranges transparency and accountability as two orthogonal and separate governance dimensions. In the literature, transparency and accountability are two of the most commonly discussed dimensions of governance but they have not been used in this manner to create a model of governance. Transparency is important on its own because it allows learning, contributes to accountability, and shapes organizational performance. Accountability provides a tool to assure that a PPP is achieving its public interest goals and also contributes to improved organizational performance. Both contribute to democracy and public perception. The matrix analyzes transparency and acco",

Abstract Governance in health is cited as one of the key factors in balancing the concerns of the government and public sector with the interests of civil society/private players, but often remains poorly described and operationalized. Richard Saltman and Antonio Duran look at two aspects in the search for new provider models in a context of health markets signalling liberalisation: (i) the role of the government to balance public and private interests and responsibilities in delivering care through modernised governance arrangements, and (ii) the finding that operational complexities may hinder well\u2013designed provider governance models, unless governance reflects country-specific realities. This commentary builds on the discussion by Saltman and Duran, and argues that the concept of governance needs to be clearly defined and operationalized in order to be helpful for policy debate as well as for the development of an applicable framework for performance improvement. It provides a working definition of governance and includes a reflection on the prevailing cultural norms in an organization or society upon which any governance needs to be build. It proposes to explore whether the \"evidence-based governance\" concept can be introduced to generate knowledge about innovative and effective governance models, and concludes that ",

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people. While the health of the young can be ensured by relatively cheap preventive measures such as ex",

While the number of Americans without health insurance has dropped significantly due to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, nearly 30 million Americans remain without health coverage and experience limited access to health care. This considerable figure should be of tremendous moral concern, as studies have shown that tens of thousands of Americans die each year due to this lack of health coverage. Additionally, universal health coverage would promote fairness, equality and greater transparency and accountability concerning access to health care.

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care and resource scarcity, healthcare rationing is a suitable practice towards ensuring healthcare resources are allocated to people in a rational, equitable, and cost-effective manner. The rising costs and demands for care place significant pressure on healthcare authorities to identify suitable strategies for the allocation of healthcare resources. Healthcare rationing as a priority-setting strategy would support healthcare authorities identify mechanisms to allocate scarce resources in a cost-effective manner. When used in the context of a priority-setting approach, healthcare rationing help",

Healthcare decision-makers have sought to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of services through removal or restriction of practices that are unsafe or of little benefit, often referred to as \u2018disinvestment\u2019. A systematic, integrated, evidence-based program for disinvestment was being established within a large Australian health service network. Consumer engagement was acknowledged as integral to this process. This paper reports the process of developing a model to integrate consumer views and preferences into an o",

The absence of previous systematic reviews on nursing care rationing leads to a gap of synthesized knowledge on the factors and processes related to rationing and the potential negative consequences on both patients and nurses. The aim of this study was to gain an in-depth understanding of the factors and processes related to nursing care rationing. Selected papers were methodologically assessed based on their design, sampling, measurement and statistical analysis. Seventeen quantitative studies were reviewed, and findings were categorized into four themes: elements of nursing care being rationed, causes of rationing, nurse outcomes and patient outcomes. Results revealed that communication with patients and families, patient ambulation, and mouth care were common elements of rationed care. Nurse-patient workload and communication barriers were reported as potential causes of rationing. Patient-related outcomes included patient falls, nosocomial infections and low patient satisfaction levels. Nurse-related outcomes included lo",

However, the need to potentially restrict the allocation of health-\u200b care resources in face of the relentless onslaught of COVID-19 has been widely accepted as a required response to the pandemic. The matter-\u200b of-\u200b fact development of recommendations for prioritized triaging of critically ill patients based on ethical principles gained rapid acceptance1,2. The initial graphic scenes of patients dying in hospital corridors because of the lack of critical care beds played itself out nightly in homes around the world \u2014 not in low-\u200b income countries but in some of the most prosperous nations on earth. The fact that older individuals were the main victims of these ad hoc rationing policies somehow seemed to make the process \u2018acceptable\u2019. Although unprecedented in high-\u200b income countries (HICs), this situation reflects the everyday reality of the majority of the world\u2019s popu\u00ad lation, who live in low- and middle- \u200b income countries (LMICs) where access to life-\u200b saving treatments is limited or absent. An implicit global double standard has long upheld that rationing was unacceptable for HICs but was tolerable",

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Rationing of nursing care (RONC) refers to necessary nursing tasks that nurses refuse or fail to do because of limited time, staffing level, or skill mix. As an important process factor, it affects the quality of patient care. The concept of rationing of nursing care has not yet been clearly defined and analyzed and there are different views regarding this issue. Using Walker and Avant's eight-step method, this concept analysis was conducted to analyze the meaning, attributes, dimensions, antecedents, and consequences of nursing care rationing. The literature was collected by searching in electronic databases including PubMed, ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar with no date limitation. Both qualitative and quantitative studies on rationing of nursing care, which were open-access and published in English, were included in this study. Thirty-three articles were investigated in the present study. The four defining attributes of RONC included the duty of performing nursing care, dealing with problems of doing nursing care, decision-making and prioritizing, and outcome. The antecedents included nurse-related, organization-related, care-related, and patient-related antecedents. A theoretical definition and a conceptual model of RONC were developed.",

L U F T Institute for Health Policy Studies, University of California, San Francisco H e a l t h m a i n t e n a n c e o r g a n i z a t i o n s (hmos), with their capitation payments and contractual obligations to provide services, present a set of economic incentives that depart significantly from those of the conventional fee-for-service medical care system. It might be expected that these incentive dif\u00ad ferences will result in different approaches to the allocation of medical resources. Furthermore, these allocation or rationing mechanisms might have ethical implications because of the differential impact on various socioeconomic groups. This paper will address a series of questions arising from the dif\u00ad ferences between prepaid and fee-for-service systems. The first section will examine the incentives under each system. In doing so, it will focus on incentives to the enrollee or patient, to the organization, and to providers within the system. This discussion will highlight the conflicting incentives inherent in various arrangements. The second section will examine how these incentives and conflicts may be dealt with in terms of the rationing or allocation of resources.

Login Alert Article contents HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIOUR UNDER RATIONING Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 18 August 2022 Abstract The pandemic-induced economic crisis has seen a massive increase in savings as households could not spend their income. The last time that consumers were seriously rationed was during the Second World War. This article models the behaviour of households during the War years and its immediate aftermath in Ireland, Sweden, the US and UK. Savings were held in liquid form and, once the War was over and rationing eased, a consumption boom transpired. However, significant excess savings were converted into physical assets in the housing market. There is evidence that this pattern is being repeated as the Covid-19 crisis eases. Keywords 1. Introduction During and after the Second World War there was a period of extended rationing in neutral countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, as well as in participants in the conflict, such as the UK and the US. Despite the differences in attitudes of these countries with respect to the War (Harrison, Reference Harrison1998),Footnote 1 consumers were affected in similar ways: real household income rose over the war years in three of these countriesFootnote 2 but consumers were severely restricted in what they could spend their money on. While this regime was in place, whether for precautionary motives, or to postpone expenditure until the goods that households sought became available, there was a major increase in household saving. As the War came to an end in 1945, the precautionary motive for saving largely disappeared and, as the goods previously rationed gradually became more freely available, the household sector returned to more \u2018normal\u2019 consumption patterns and ran down some, but not all, of its stock of excess savings. It remains to be seen whethe",

Dear Editor, Most people place very high value on enjoying good health. Consequently, it is generally regarded as unfair that certain groups within society (such as people with disabilities ) do not enjoy the same level of good health as others. Modern societies are not supposed to privilege one conception of \u201cthe good life\u201d over another. Each individual has the right to have his or her own conception of the good life, and having the capability to be healthy is a prerequisite for this (1). Social justice is central to the mission of public health. A basic principle of justice is that individuals and groups should receive fair, equitable, and appropriate treatment in light of what is due or owed to them. Justice, can provide guidance on how to allocate scarce therapeutic resources in a public health crisis(2), such as the Covid 19 pandemic. Social justice demands that we constantly question what is ethical. The poor, the old and those with disabilities - physical, sensory or intellectual - are at risk while health hazards, such as the Covid 19 pandemic, threaten the entire population. Even in times of resource constraints, the vulnerable members of society must be protected (1). Health facilities, goods and services must be accessible to all, especially the most vulnerable or marginalized sections of the population without discrimination. Neglecting ( ignoring or not understanding) the needs of the vulnerable harms the whole of society by eroding public trust ( in government, public health authorities and professional groups) and undermining social cohesion. Social justice encompasses not only a core commitment to a fair distribution of resources, but it also calls for policies, guidelines, and protocols in healthcare and social care that are consistent with the preservation of human dignity and the showing of eq",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. As the dreaded R-word \u2014 rationing \u2014 once again worms its way into our debate on health care reform, it may be helpful to relearn what is taught about rationing in freshman economics. In their well-known textbook Microeconomics, the Harvard professor Michael L. Katz and the Princeton professor Harvey S. Rosen, for example, put it thusly: Prices ration scarce resources. If bread were free, a huge quantity of it would be demanded. Because the resources used to produce bread are scarce, the actual amount of bread has to be rationed among its potential users. Not everyone can have all the bread that they could possibly want. The bread must be rationed somehow; the price system accomplishes this in the following way: Everyone who is willing to pay the equilibrium price gets the good, and everyone who does not, does not. [Italics added.] In short, free markets are not an alternative to rationing. They are just one particular form of rationing. Ever since the Fall from Grace, human beings have had to ration everything not available in unlimited quantities, and market forces do most of the rationing. Many critics of the current health reform efforts would have us believe that only governments ration things. When a government insurance program refuses to pay for procedures that the managers of those insurance pools do not consider worth the taxpayer\u2019s money, these critics immediately trot out the R-word. It is the core of their argument against cost-effectiveness analysis and a public health plan for the nonelderly. On the other hand, these same people believe that when, for similar reasons, a private health insurer refuses to pay for a particular procedure or has a price-tiered formulary for drugs \u2013 e.g., asking the insured to pay a 35 percent coinsurance rate on highly expensive biologic specialty drugs that effectively put that drug out of ",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1.

This paper reviews alternative approaches that can be used to allocate healthcare resources. It discusses the problems encountered when allocating healthcare resources according to free market principles. It then proceeds to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of alternative resource allocation approaches that can be applied to public health systems. These include: (i) approaches based on the concept of meeting the needs of the population to maximising its capacity to benefit from interventions; (ii) economic approaches that identify the most efficient allocation of resources with the view of maximising health benefits or other measures of social welfare; (iii) approaches that seek to ration healthcare by age; and (iv) approaches that resolve resource allocation disputes through debate and bargaining. At present, there appears to be no consensus about the relative importance of the potentially conflicting principles that can be used to guide resource allocation decisions. It is concluded that whatever shape tomorrow\u2019s health service takes, the requirement to make equitable and efficient use of finite healthcare resources will remain.

This study explores the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and machine learning (ML) predictive analysis in healthcare facilities to optimize resource allocation. With the omnipresence of IoT devices and the analytic prowess of ML, our research aims to develop a model that can predict real-time resource demands, ranging from patient care equipment to manpower distribution. Drawing data from wearable sensors, embedded devices, and facility infrastructure, the proposed ML model demonstrates significant improvement in predicting short-term resource needs. Preliminary results indicate a reduction in resource wastage, enhanced patient care, and increased operational efficiency in healthcare facilities that incorporated the proposed system. However, the research also acknowledges potential limitations, including data security concerns and system scalability. The findings presented highlight the transformative potential of IoT and ML in revolutionizing resource management in health care.

Instead, the AI that we are working with is a very sophisticated technology that is trained to predict and analyze things based on what it has been coded and trained to recognize. So in that spirit, let\u2019s take a moment to look at all of the work that AI-driven predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms are doing in the world of healthcare right now. We reached out to our brilliant Healthcare IT Today Community and asked them how AI-driven predictive analytics and machine learning algorithms are being employed to streamline hospital operations, optimize resource allocations, and improve overall healthcare system efficiency. The following are their answers. Varun Ganapathi, Co-Founder and Chief Technology Officer at AKASA AI and ML have advanced dramatically recently. Now, with generative AI, artificial intelligence can play a significant role in understanding both clinical and payer-related documents.

This results in wastage in health systems and loss of potential population health. However, if health systems are to serve people best, then they must operate efficiently and equitably, and appropriate valuation methods are needed to determine how to do this. With the advances in computing power over the past few decades, advanced mathematical optimization algorithms can now be run on personal computers and can be used to provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for policymakers on how to prioritize health spending considering policy objectives, interactions of interventions, real-world system constraints and budget envelopes. Such methods provide an invaluable complement to traditional or extended cost-effectiveness analyses or league tables. In this paper, we describe how such methods work, how policymakers and programme managers can access them and implement their recommendations and how they have changed health spending in the world to date. The realities of finite resources mean that health-care packages need to be prioritized. Traditional methods such as cost-effectiveness analysis are one way to do this but have limitations. Here we outline how mathematical optimization algorithms can be used to provide comprehensive, evidence-based recommendations for policymakers on how to prioritize health spending and provide an accessible summary of how they work.

Public debate also tends to focus on situations of scarcity such as lack of kidneys or hearts for transplantation, or heated arguments regarding whether the latest very expensive new drug should be made available, regardless of cost, to treat certain condition such as cystic fibrosis or a particular type of cancer. The idea that nursing or medical time is an important healthcare resource that needs to be allocated with care rarely gets an effective airing in public debate. I argue in this chapter that it is important in the healthcare context to differentiate resource allocation from rationing, on the basis that if we assume we are rationing healthcare as our starting point we may miss opportunities to examine more and less effective ways of allocating the healthcare resource. This is particularly important in nursing care where failure to examine carefully how the nursing resource is allocated, and supported, is leading to covert rationing of nursing time and suboptimal patient care in hospitals across Europe.

The problem is healthcare will never be free. Whether its run by government or the private sector it will always cost money. The problem is whether or not you would like to be able to pick and choose what services you would like and what quality of care you would like to receive. The biggest point in the article is that the private sector has incentives to provide the best quality care possible while if it was operated by the government, individual healthcare workers lose many competitive factors that drive their efficiency to the maximum. The only positive is that healthcare becomes available to all people rather than to only those who can afford it. I believe the obvious fix to this is to have the government provide it for those who cant afford it but never force those who can afford to pay for their own onto their system. This would retain the free market competitiveness to increase efficiency while stil",

They play by the rules, work hard just like the rest of Americans, and yet they can't get insurance from the employer because it's not offered, or they can't afford it if it is offered. Is that their fault? \u2022 Is it really anyone's fault that health insurance is so expensive that they can't afford it? The high costs of health care are due to influences beyond any one individual's control - they are influenced by society-wide trends towards increased use of technology, high administrative costs of our healthcare system, and a strong profit motive in the health insurance industry that drives up the cost of premiums. The uninsured should take more individual responsibility to get insurance. It\u2019s not our responsibility to give them insurance. \u2022 A small percentage of the uninsured can afford insurance but choose not to obtain it. Most of these are young, healthy individuals. Should these people go to the ER or become hospitalized, their medical bills may become so great that they can't afford to pay it, in which case the hospital often writes off all or part of their bill as \"uncompensated care.\" In so doing, government and individuals with private insurance end up subsidizing the cost of care for these people, who essentially become \"free-riders\" off the system. \u2022 For the vast majority of the uninsured, however, inability to afford health insurance, and not a conscious choice, is the reason they are uninsured. It's fine to say that people should take individual responsibility if they can afford to carry out that responsibility. Since this is not the case for the majority of the uninsured, it becomes ridiculous to argue that the problem of uninsurance can be solved with simple individu",

While the number of Americans without health insurance has dropped significantly due to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, nearly 30 million Americans remain without health coverage and experience limited access to health care. This considerable figure should be of tremendous moral concern, as studies have shown that tens of thousands of Americans die each year due to this lack of health coverage. Additionally, universal health coverage would promote fairness, equality and greater transparency and accountability concerning access to health care.

                      "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

                      "raw_content": " \r Rationing of healthcare before, during and after COVID-19 Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, it became evident the United States would face difficult resource allocation decisions. Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in every healthcare system, including in the United States. All resources are scarce. This concept is built into common definitions of the subject of economics. The nation\u2019s healthcare resources must be allocated among patients in need according to either explicit or implicit criteria. The rationing frameworks espoused during the pandemic demonstrate some of the various ways in which healthcare can be, and is, rationed by healthcare systems in other countries, including consideration of life-years saved and wait times. In the United States, de facto rationing generally occurs through prices according to the ability to pay. Approximately one-third of U.S. adults report skipping needed care or treatments because of cost. This implicit rationing gives some people the impression that rationing of healthcare does not take place in the United States. Use of the term rationing commonly evokes notions of \u201cdeath panels.\u201d Debate about healthcare rationing has a long and storied history in both medical ethics and health economics literatures.

Abstract Background: It is difficult to provide health care services to all those in need of such services due to limited resources and unlimited demands. Thus, priority setting and rationing have to be applied. This study aimed at critically examining the concept of rationing in health sector and identifying its purposes, influencing factors, mechanisms, and outcomes. Methods: The critical interpretive synthesis methodology was used in this study. PubMed, Cochrane, and Proquest databases were searched using the related key words to find related documents published between 1970 and 2015. In total, 161 published reports were reviewed and included in the study. Thematic content analysis was applied for data analysis. Results: Health services rationing means restricting the access of some people to useful or potentially useful health services due to budgetary limitation. The inherent features of the health market and health services, limited resources, and unlimited needs necessitate health services rationing. Rationing can be applied in 4 levels: health care policy- makers, health care m",

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1. This pressure has affected virtually every nation on earth \u2014 regardless of national income level \u2014 and has forced planning and/or the implementation of health-\u200b care rationing almost universally. Rationing has always carried negative connotations and, until the current crisis, its mention would have at least raised some eyebrows, if not invited outright condemnation by members of civil society and many health-\u200b care workers.

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater equity. A number of countries have attempted to depoliticize decisions on rationing by using health technology assessments and dedicated agencies. Discussion: Resource allocation and rationing differ considerably between the US and Europe. In the US, where social welfare remains controversial, there are few restrictions on the use of health care technology regardless of cost or clinical effectiveness. European countries engage in more explicit debates about these limits, though these are complica",

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances?

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Abstract Objectives Coronavirus Disease 2019 has presented extreme difficulties to healthcare resource allocation worldwide. Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and priorit",

It can be used for unrestricted research re-use and analysis in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source, for the duration of the public health emergency. According to traditional medical ethics, physicians have a duty to do everything within their power to medically benefit their patients, an obligation that ordinarily exceeds their professional duties to others. 1 The most common exception to this requirement occurs when fulfilling it also inevitably harms others\u2014a situation that may arise in a public health emergency, such as a pandemic. An essential goal in a pandemic is maintaining public health\u2014the health of a population. Ethical duties in public health are analogous to those in a physician\u2010patient relationship but are directed to a population, and include producing benefits, minimizing harms, producing maximal utility, distributing benefits and burdens fairly, respecting autonomous choices, keeping promises and commitments, disclosing information truthfully, and maintaining trust. 2 A pandemic's extraordinary demand on critical care resources produces a dilemma because demand may far exceed the available supply and produce scarcity. In this circumstance, not all patients can receive optimal treatment and the treatment of 1 patient incurs an opportunity cost that potentially harms other patients. Alth",

A predominantly paternalistic way to decide about available options to maintain or improve individual or collective health has been moving to a shared-decision model considering the empowered patient. In spite of the reduction of uncertainty when making health and health care decisions due to the advancement in scientific methods, and, in spite of the asymmetry of information, knowledge and power to make decisions, we are progressively recognizing the importance of individuals, the target of the intervention, to express their preferences and to take an active role in the decision making process. Health care stakeholders, recognizing the scarcity of resources available and the fortunate ever increasing amount of applicable knowledge and its corresponding interventions to improve the population quantity and quality of life, should stimulate society to address and discuss health care issues that will guide critical choices and define health care priorities based mostly on judgment and the best evidence available. Commentary The exponential increase of knowledge in the life sciences field, more specifically in health sciences, in the past few years has brought additional levels of complexity when deciding and implementing strategies in the health care system.

We argue that the application of established principles of equal treatment, need, prognosis and cost-effectiveness gives rise to what we call negative dynamics: a gradual depletion of the value possible to generate through healthcare. These principles should therefore be complemented by a sustainability principle, making the prospect of negative dynamics a further factor to consider, and possibly outweigh considerations highlighted by the other principles. We demonstrate how this principle may take different forms, and show that a commitment to sustainability is supported by considerations internal to the ethical principles already guiding healthcare resource allocation. We also consider two objections. The first of these, we argue, is either based on implausible assumptions or begs the question, whereas the second can be adequately accommodated by the principle we propose.

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suita",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The aim of this paper was to empirically analyze the relationship between public health expenditure and health outcomes among EU developing countries. Using regression analysis and factor analysis, we documented that public health expenditure and health outcomes are in a long-run equilibrium relationship and the status of health expenditure can improve life expectancy and reduce infant mortality. Secondarily, we studied how the status of good governance, health care system performance, and socioeconomic vulnerabilities affect the public health\u2019s outcomes in the selected countries. We found that the effectiveness of health and the way to reduce infant mortality or to improve life quality is directed conditioned by good governance status. Moreover, the consolidation of health care system performance directly improves the quality of life among EU developing countries, which indicates that public policymakers should intervene and provide political and financial support through policy mixes.

The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of health expenditures on health outcomes in the OECD countries. Method: We used the system generalized method of moments (GMM) for thirty eight OECD countries using panel data from 1996 to 2020. Results and discussion: The findings show that health expenditures have a negative impact on infant mortality while positive on life expectancy. The results further verify that the income measured as GDP, number of doctors, and air pollution has a negative effect on infant mortality, while these variables have a positive effect on life expectancy in the studied countries. The outcome of the study suggests that health expenditures need to be properly utilized and improvements can be made in the health policies to increase the investment in health technology. The government should also focus on measures like economic and environmental to have long-lasting health outcomes. Introduction Healthcare is a persistent challenge for nations around the world. The growing economic and environmental challenges pose risks to the healthcare system (1\u20133). People suffer due to such risks and are prone to various diseases, including a child and maternal mortality, non-communicable diseases, infectious diseases, and lack of healthcare facilities (4, 5). According to research by the PEW research center, 85% of people consider the lack of healthcare facilities as a major problem in their respective healthcare systems (6). A good healthcare system is not only limited to treating diseases but also contributes to the economy (7, 8). Therefore, nations need to finance their healthcare system more effectively, which is a critical component of the health system (9\u201311). Investment in healthcare is important for both short- and long-term benefits (12, 13). Good health, an imp",

Health spending has a significant effect on reducing infant and under-5 child mortality with an elasticity of 0.13 to 0.33 for infant mortality and 0.15 to 0.38 for under-5 child mortality in models estimated using fixed effects methods (depending on models employed). Government health spending also has a significant effect on reducing infant and child mortality and the size of the coefficient depends on the level of good governance achieved by the country, indicating that good governance increases the effectiveness of health spending. This paper contributes to the new evidence pointing to the importance of investing in health care services and the importance of governance in improving health outcomes.

Toner, MD; Yoram Unguru, MD; Maureen van Stone, JD; and Allen Kachalia, MD, JD The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may require rationing of various medical resources if demand exceeds supply. Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance, but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, \ufb01ve health systems in Maryland formed a consortium\u2014with diverse expertise and representation\u2014representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process that determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and health-care professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens\u2019 values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, ICU resources, blood components, novel thera-peutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were devel-oped. Creating operational algorithms for each resou",

Chapter 5Strengthening public health interventions Public health has faced unprecedented pressures from the multiple demands of designing measures to reduce transmission of SARS-CoV-2, developing policies to counterbalance their unintended or undesirable consequences, for example for mental health, and maintaining delivery of essential public health services, such as screening and vaccination programmes. The initial response was dominated, in the absence of a vaccine, by nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to control transmission. These were supported, to varying degrees of success, with FTTIS services (Section 5.1). Following the development of effective COVID-19 vaccines that became available in late 2020, public health systems have also needed to develop and implement mass vaccination campaigns (Section 5.2). However, as resources shifted and access to services were constrained, it was difficult to maintain \u2013 at least initially \u2013 other core public health functions alongside the pandemic response (Section 5.3).

Abstract During catastrophic disasters, government leaders must decide how to efficiently and effectively allocate scarce public health and medical resources. The literature about triage decision making at the individual patient level is substantial, and the National Response Framework provides guidance about the distribution of responsibilities between federal and state governments. However, little has been written about the decision-making process of federal leaders in disaster situations when resources are not sufficient to meet the needs of several states simultaneously. We offer an ethical framework and logic model for decision making in such circumstances. We adapted medical triage and the federalism principle to the decision-making process for allocating scarce federal public health and medical resources. We believe that the logic model provides a values-based framework that can inform the gestalt during the iterative decision process used by federal leaders as they allocate scarce resources to states during catastrophic disasters.

Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries. 2nd edition. Chapter 14Ethical Issues in Resource Allocation, Research, and New Product Development Dan W. Brock and Daniel Wikler. The ethical justification for developing and providing the means to reduce the burden of disease in developing countries is self-evident. Nevertheless, those who pursue these laudable ends encounter ethical dilemmas at every turn. The development of new interventions requires testing with human subjects, an activity fraught with controversy since the dawn of scientific medicine and especially problematic with poor and vulnerable participants in developing countries. Ethical dilemmas arising in setting priorities among interventions and among individuals in need of care are most acute when needs are great and resources few. We address some of these concerns in this chapter, identifying some of the principal ethical issues that arise in the development and allocation of effective interventions for developing countries and discussing some alternative resolutions. We omit discussion of two other aspects of these ethical decisions: ensuring that the process of decision making is fair and involves the subject population (Daniel",

Corresponding author. Series information Ethics in Public Health Research Accepted 2007 Dec 4. Abstract I trace the evolution of ethical approaches to health policy in the United States and examine a number of critical unresolved issues pertaining to the current set of frameworks. Several themes emerge. First, fair procedures claim more attention than substantive and procedural principles. Second, in the case of public deliberation, more focus has been placed on factors such as procedural mechanisms than on understanding how individuals and groups value different aspects of health and agree on health-related decisions. Third, the nation needs workable frameworks to guide collective choices about valuable social ends and their trade-offs; purely procedural strategies are limited in illuminating overarching health policy and ethics questions. There is a need to integrate consequential and procedural approaches to health ethics and policy. IT IS AGAIN TIME FOR A debate on health care reform in the United States. A major paradox of the American health care system is the existence of dramatic therapeutic gains alongside large discrepancies in access to quality care.

I first describe and explain the steps we took to develop this framework, drawing on previous experience and literature to explain what frameworks can and cannot do. I distinguish frameworks from other kinds of guidance and justify why our framework takes the form it does. Our key aim was to help answer practical questions faced by frontline clinicians. I then explain some of the normative issues that shape the content of the framework itself. Here, I engage critically with the resource allocation literature and justify the particular positions that we take in the framework. Although we undertook this work to address resource allocation decisions anticipated during the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic, it will also serve as an example for others who wish to design practical ethics frameworks for other bioethical issues that will emerge in the future.

In anticipation of resource constraints arising in clinical settings as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, a working party of ten ethicists (seven clinicians and three full-time academics) was convened at the University of Sydney to draft an ethics framework to support resource allocation decisions. The framework guides decision-makers using a question-and-answer format, in language that avoids philosophical and medical technicality. The working party met five times over the following week and then submitted a draft Framework for consideration by two groups of intensivists and one group of academic ethicists. It was also presented to a panel on a national current affairs programme. The Framework was then revised on the basis of feedback from these sources and made publicly available online on April 3, ten days after the initial meeting. The framework is published here in full to stimulate ongoing discussion about rapid development of user-friendly clinical ethics resources in ongoing and future pandemics.

However, this may not be possible during a pandemic, when health resources are likely to be limited. Setting priorities and rationing resources in this context means making tragic choices, but these tragic choices can be ethically justified. This is why we have ethics. This policy brief answers a number of questions about the ethics of setting priorities for the allocation of resources during times of scarcity. Such decisions may include access to hospitals, ventilators, vaccines and medicines. It is essential that policies and practices are ethically justified in such contexts. The document provides a high-level ethical framework that can be used to guide decision-making, and complements WHO\u2019s technical guidance. 1. Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19? Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelm",

Abstract During catastrophic disasters, government leaders must decide how to efficiently and effectively allocate scarce public health and medical resources. The literature about triage decision making at the individual patient level is substantial, and the National Response Framework provides guidance about the distribution of responsibilities between federal and state governments. However, little has been written about the decision-making process of federal leaders in disaster situations when resources are not sufficient to meet the needs of several states simultaneously. We offer an ethical framework and logic model for decision making in such circumstances. We adapted medical triage and the federalism principle to the decision-making process for allocating scarce federal public health and medical resources. We believe that the logic model provides a values-based framework that can inform the gestalt during the iterative decision process used by federal leaders as they allocate scarce resources to states during catastrophic disasters.

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, created the need for an effective vaccine. Questions arose about allocating the initial limited supplies in the United States. We present four allocation models and compare their characteristics for ethically meeting the health needs of the population. The literature shares broad agreement on guiding ethical principles with those of the four proposed models for vaccine allocation, featuring the concepts of utilitarianism, prioritarianism, equity, and reciprocity. We conclude that the \u201cInterim Framework for COVID-19 Vaccine Allocation and Distribution in the United States\u201d from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health is the most comprehensive and ethically sound. We recommend government officials and policymakers at all levels consider the principles and objectives in this model as US COVID-19 vaccination distribution efforts continue. This model may serve as an effective framework for initial vaccine distribution efforts during future epidemic and pandemic events",

Their general aim is to do good. But to do good, they have to be good. They need sufficient capacity to act where public action is required. And they need to possess genuine capability so as to generate and realize positive change for the better. Good intentions and ample resources are not enough to deliver good outcomes. Citizen-focused and evidence-based approach to policy making can ensure that the right public policies are being pursued. But are they being implemented in the right way, and are politicians and public servants doing the right things to assure cost-effective and trustworthy government action? Public ethics and citizens\u2019 experience of fairness lie at the heart of good public services. And it is why the ethical behavior of politicians, senior public executives, and mainstream public servants is central in shaping the overall ability of governments to do good. Considerations as to what constitutes ethical behavior (both positive and negative) will vary across nations and cultures. But despite this, there are widely accepted practices of good behaviors that need to be encouraged and bad behaviors that need to be eliminated. This chapter brings questions of ethics and fairness to the foreground. It outlines how virtue-based ethics (to doing the right thing) can complement more normative as well as consequence-based ethical approaches.

Under OGE\u2019s leadership, preventing ethical lapses and protecting the impartiality of government decisionmaking is the day-to-day work of thousands of officials who implement, investigate, and enforce the ethics laws and rules in the more than 140 agencies across the executive branch. OGE uses oversight, rules, advice and counseling, financial disclosure, education, and transparency to enable federal employees at all stages of their service to preserve the public trust. Specifically, the program strives to ensure: \u2022 Presidential appointees are aware of their ethical obligations and roles in creating an ethical culture in their organizations as they begin government service. \u2022 Public servants at all levels remain free from conflicts of interest, and even the appearance of conflicts of interest, as they carry out the responsibilities the American people have entrusted to them. \u2022 Employees who are seeking to leave the government avoid conflicts of interest and, after they leave government service, do not exercise undue influence over their former agencies on behalf of others. Above all, the program strives to protect the public\u2019s trust in gove",

While it has the potential to bring many benefits, the risks of commercial exploitation or unknown technological dangers have led many jurisdictions to seek a legal response before measurable harm occurs. However, the lack of technical capabilities to regulate this sector despite the urgency to do so resulted in regulatory inertia. Given the borderless nature of this issue, an internationally coordinated response is necessary. This article focuses on the theoretical framework being established in relation to the development of international law applicable to AI and the regulatory authority to create and monitor enforcement of said law. The authors argue that the road ahead remains full of obstacles that must be tackled before the above-mentioned elements see the light despite the attempts being made currently to that end.

Examining Defense Budget Ethics: Balancing Security and Morality The ethical implications surrounding defense budgets are vital in assessing national priorities and accountability. As governments allocate substantial resources to military expenditures, the question of defense budget ethics becomes increasingly relevant in evaluating the moral responsibilities of decision-makers. Throughout history, various conflicts have illuminated the ethical complexities inherent in defense spending. Examining these historical perspectives provides insight into how ethical standards in defense budget allocation have evolved and the critical need for transparency and stakeholder engagement. Table of Contents The Ethical Framework of Defense Budgeting The ethical framework of defense budgeting encompasses principles that guide the allocation and use of funds designated for national defense. It considers the moral responsibilities of governments to prioritize security while balancing societal needs and values. This framework helps ensure accountability in spending, promoting fairness and transparency. A key aspect of this ethical framework involves prioritizing security without compromising the welfare of citizens. Decisions regarding resource allocation must address the complex interplay of military preparedness and public interests, advocating for responsible spending that respects democratic processes. Transparency is critical to the ethical framework, as it fosters trust between governments and their citizens. Open disclosure about budgets enables informed public discourse and scrutiny. This transparency is instrumental in assessing whether defense budgets reflect ethical considerations and national priorities. Ultimately, ethical defense budgeting requires continuous evaluation of priorities. By integrating ethical principles into budgetary processes, governments can strive to reflect their commitment to both national security and social justice, thus reinforcing a holistic approach to def",

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person. Some of the same concern arises in mixed medical systems with multiple funding sources. 3.1.

Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance, but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, \ufb01ve health systems in Maryland formed a consortium\u2014with diverse expertise and representation\u2014representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process that determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and health-care professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens\u2019 values and by general expert consensus.

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person. Some of the same concern arises in mixed medical systems with multiple funding sources. 3.1.

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was under-taken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods: A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and rel-evant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language.

After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reci-procity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality.

Abstract Background Crisis Standards of Care (CSC) provide a framework for the fair allocation of scarce resources during emergencies. The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has disproportionately affected Black and Latinx populations in the USA. No literature exists comparing state-level CSC. It is unknown how equitably CSC would allocate resources. Methods The authors identified all publicly available state-level CSC through online searches and communication with state governments. Publicly available CSC were systematically reviewed for content including ethical framework and prioritization strategy. Results CSC were identified for 29 states. Ethical principles were explicitly stated in 23 (79.3%). Equity was listed as a guiding ethical principle in 15 (51.7%); 19 (65.5%) said decisions should not factor in race, ethnicity, disability, and other identity-based factors. Ten states (34.4%) allowed for consideration of societal value, which could lead to prioritization of health care workers and other essential personnel. Twenty-one (72.4%) CSC",

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Toner, MD; Yoram Unguru, MD; Maureen van Stone, JD; and Allen Kachalia, MD, JD The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic may require rationing of various medical resources if demand exceeds supply. Theoretical frameworks for resource allocation have provided much needed ethical guidance, but hospitals still need to address objective practicalities and legal vetting to operationalize scarce resource allocation schemata. To develop operational scarce resource allocation processes for public health catastrophes, including the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, \ufb01ve health systems in Maryland formed a consortium\u2014with diverse expertise and representation\u2014representing more than half of all hospitals in the state. Our efforts built on a prior statewide community engagement process that determined the values and moral reference points of citizens and health-care professionals regarding the allocation of ventilators during a public health catastrophe. Through a partnership of health systems, we developed a scarce resource allocation framework informed by citizens\u2019 values and by general expert consensus. Allocation schema for mechanical ventilators, ICU resources, blood components, novel thera-peutics, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and renal replacement therapies were devel-oped.

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Abstract Public choice scholars have attended only modestly to issues in public health. We expect that to change rapidly given the Covid-19 pandemic. The time therefore is ripe for taking stock of public-choice relevant scholarship that addresses issues in public health. That is what we do. Our stock-taking highlights three themes: (1) Public health regulations often are driven by private interests, not public ones. (2) The allocation of public health resources often reflects private interests, not public ones. (3) Public health policies may have perverse effects, undermining instead of promoting health-consumer welfare.

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person. Some of the same concern arises in mixed medical systems with multiple funding sources. 3.1.

Healthcare market is imperfect, and the government cannot ensure access to essential medicines if the market is left to operate under invisible hand control. This scoping review was conducted with intention to provide the clear picture on impact of pharmaceutical price regulation on access to essential medicines, drug innovation and launching. We searched articles written in the English language since January 2000 from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Ovid/Medline and Google scholar with systematic search query. Access to essential medicines, which is defined in terms of availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of drugs, can be improved by pharmaceutical price regulation. Countries can use different price regulation strategies based on their healthcare objectives and priority healthcare needs. Country-specific pharmaceutical price regulation could not significantly affect drug innovation and launching. However, supportive strategies such as open public funding for drug innovation research, providing innovation awards and strong patent rights can counterbalance the effect of price regulation on innovation and drug development research in developed countries.

A framework is provided for understanding the 10 roles that government plays in improving health care quality and safety in the United States. Examples of proposed federal actions to reduce medical errors and enhance patient safety are provided to illustrate the 10 roles: (1) purchase health care, (2) provide health care, (3) ensure access to quality care for vulnerable populations, (4) regulate health care markets, (5) support acquisition of new knowledge, (6) develop and evaluate health technologies and practices, (7) monitor health care quality, (8) inform health care decision makers, (9) develop the health care workforce, and (10) convene stakeholders from across the health care system. Conclusion: Government's responsibility to protect and advance the interests of society includes the delivery of high-quality health care. Because the market alone cannot ensure all Americans access to quality health care, the government must preserve the interests of its citizens by supplementing the market where there are gaps and regulating the market where there is inefficiency or unfairness.

It is a situation where forces of demand and supply interact to determine prices of goods and services being exchanged. Healthcare is essentially one of basic human need and very limited and requires allocation and institutions to organize its allocation.

This paper explores the market failures and policy failures that exist in the management of chronic diseases. Discussion: There are many sources of market failure in health care that undermine the efficiency of chronic disease management. These include incomplete information as well as information asymmetry between providers and consumers, the effect of externalities on consumer behaviour, and the divergence between social and private time preference rates. This has seen government and policy interventions to address both market failures and distributional issues resulting from the inability of private markets to reach an efficient and equitable distribution of resources. However, these have introduced a series of policy failures such as distorted re-imbursement arrangements across modalities and delivery settings. Summary: The paper concludes that market failure resulting from a preference of individuals for 'immediate gratification' in the form of health care and disease management, rather than preventative services, where the benefits are delayed, has a major impact on achieving an efficient allocation of resource",

Healthcare market is imperfect, and the government cannot ensure access to essential medicines if the market is left to operate under invisible hand control. This scoping review was conducted with intention to provide the clear picture on impact of pharmaceutical price regulation on access to essential medicines, drug innovation and launching. We searched articles written in the English language since January 2000 from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Ovid/Medline and Google scholar with systematic search query. Access to essential medicines, which is defined in terms of availability, affordability, accessibility, acceptability and quality of drugs, can be improved by pharmaceutical price regulation. Countries can use different price regulation strategies based on their healthcare objectives and priority healthcare needs. Country-specific pharmaceutical price regulation could not significantly affect drug innovation and launching. However, supportive strategies such as open public funding for drug innovation research, providing innovation awards and strong patent rights can counterbalance the effect of price regulation on innovation and drug development research in developed countries.

The problem is healthcare will never be free. Whether its run by government or the private sector it will always cost money. The problem is whether or not you would like to be able to pick and choose what services you would like and what quality of care you would like to receive. The biggest point in the article is that the private sector has incentives to provide the best quality care possible while if it was operated by the government, individual healthcare workers lose many competitive factors that drive their efficiency to the maximum. The only positive is that healthcare becomes available to all people rather than to only those who can afford it. I believe the obvious fix to this is to have the government provide it for those who cant afford it but never force those who can afford to pay for their own onto their system. This would retain the free market competitiveness to increase efficiency while stil",

Often known as universal health care, single payer has been an extremely polarizing topic for decades. Some of the basics of the debate include the fact that single payer is a method for organizing health care financing through the government. Single payer is primarily financed through taxes and pays the costs of essential health care for all residents of the state. The issue of whether or not the United States should adopt a single payer health care system has been at the forefront of national elections for decades. Common throughout the rest of the industrialized world, opponents of single payer often cite the differing needs, the role of America, and preferences of the American people as rationale against single payer. Add to that the fact that a majority of Americans are happy with their health care. Not to mention America\u2019s current multi-payer health care system is the center of the world\u2019s most cutting edge biomedical research. For many reasons, single payer is far short of a clear conclusion. \u00a0 With that said, the United States is the only very highly developed nation without universal health care. That\u2019s over 50 countries of diverse size, values, economic stature, and cultures. And many of these nations have implemented single payer successfully. \u00a0Add to that that many health outcomes in America aren\u2019t getting better, and that Americans spend by far the most money on health care of any nation in the world. For many, the rationale for drastically changing our healthcare system is strong. With solid arguments on either side, we leave it to you to decide. \u00a0Is single payer health care really the right move for American health care? \u00a0 The 10 Strongest Arguments For Single Payer Health Care The argument that health care is an inalienable right -- not a",

They play by the rules, work hard just like the rest of Americans, and yet they can't get insurance from the employer because it's not offered, or they can't afford it if it is offered. Is that their fault? \u2022 Is it really anyone's fault that health insurance is so expensive that they can't afford it? The high costs of health care are due to influences beyond any one individual's control - they are influenced by society-wide trends towards increased use of technology, high administrative costs of our healthcare system, and a strong profit motive in the health insurance industry that drives up the cost of premiums. The uninsured should take more individual responsibility to get insurance. It\u2019s not our responsibility to give them insurance. \u2022 A small percentage of the uninsured can afford insurance but choose not to obtain it. Most of these are young, healthy individuals. Should these people go to the ER or become hospitalized, their medical bills may become so great that they can't afford to pay it, in which case the hospital often writes off all or part of their bill as \"uncompensated care.\" In so doing, government and individuals with private insurance end up subsidizing the cost of care for these people, who essentially become \"free-riders\" off the system. \u2022 For the vast majority of the uninsured, however, inability to afford health insurance, and not a conscious choice, is the reason they are uninsured. It's fine to say that people should take individual responsibility if they can afford to carry out that responsibility. Since this is not the case for the majority of the uninsured, it becomes ridiculous to argue that the problem of uninsurance can be solved with simple individu",

Abstract The goal of universal health coverage is to \u201censure that all people obtain the health services they need without suffering financial hardship when paying for them.\u201d There are many connections between this goal and the state\u2019s legal obligation to realize the human right to health. In the context of this goal, it is important to assess private actors\u2019 involvement in the health sector. For example, private actors may not always have the incentives to deal with externalities that affect the availability, accessibility, acceptability, and quality of health care services; they may not be in a position to provide \u201cpublic goods\u201d; or they may operate under imperfect information. This paper sets out to answer the question, what legal human rights obligations do states have in terms of regulating private sector involvement in health care?

Login Alert Article contents Private Power in Public Programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and the Structural Power of Private Insurance Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 27 January 2023 Abstract In 2019, nearly 70 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received their health insurance coverage through a private, managed care organization (MCO). Twenty-five years earlier, 9.5 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in MCOs. This dramatic growth in Medicaid managed care enrollment represents the delegation of significant power by federal and state governments over a critical social program to private actors and market forces. Medicare, too, experienced a similar pattern of transformation. Together, Medicaid and Medicare, two critical pillars of American social policy, paid more than half a trillion dollars to private insurance companies in 2019 to provide public health insurance to 75 million people. This manuscript examines the policy consequences of building private firms directly into the structure of American social policies. In contrast to existing work on \u201csubmerged\u201d or \u201cdelegated\u201d policies, this manuscript highlights the structural power that such policies bestow on the government's private partners and develops a new theory of structural power in which firms are able to constrain health policy reform through their threats to disrupt the delivery of public policies and social benefits to millions of people across the United States. Over the past twenty-five years, private insurance companies have gained a tremendous responsibility and financial stake in America's publicly financed health insurance programs. In 2019, nearly 70 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received their health care coverage through a private managed care organization (MCO) like UnitedHealth or Wellcare.Footnote 1 As a result of this h",

Login Alert Article contents Private Power in Public Programs: Medicare, Medicaid, and the Structural Power of Private Insurance Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 27 January 2023 Abstract In 2019, nearly 70 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received their health insurance coverage through a private, managed care organization (MCO). Twenty-five years earlier, 9.5 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in MCOs. This dramatic growth in Medicaid managed care enrollment represents the delegation of significant power by federal and state governments over a critical social program to private actors and market forces. Medicare, too, experienced a similar pattern of transformation. Together, Medicaid and Medicare, two critical pillars of American social policy, paid more than half a trillion dollars to private insurance companies in 2019 to provide public health insurance to 75 million people. This manuscript examines the policy consequences of building private firms directly into the structure of American social policies. In contrast to existing work on \u201csubmerged\u201d or \u201cdelegated\u201d policies, this manuscript highlights the structural power that such policies bestow on the government's private partners and develops a new theory of structural power in which firms are able to constrain health policy reform through their threats to disrupt the delivery of public policies and social benefits to millions of people across the United States. Over the past twenty-five years, private insurance companies have gained a tremendous responsibility and financial stake in America's publicly financed health insurance programs. In 2019, nearly 70 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries received their health care coverage through a private managed care organization (MCO) like UnitedHealth or Wellcare.Footnote 1 As a result of this h",

Introduction The spread of Covid-19 disease has imposed enormous socio-economic losses (Lenzen et al., 2020) over a million human lives and serious distributional conflicts with tremendous inequitable hardships\u2014both mental and financial\u2014on people worldwide (Esseau-Thomas et al., 2022; Furceri et al., 2020). While the rich and well-to-do may have experienced some inconveniences but will continue their lifestyles, life will never be the same for billions of the poor and middle-class people throughout the world. The top responsibilities of all governments are saving and protecting lives and properties and ensuring the basic needs of people are met. Most governments have tried to overcome these dramatic adverse impacts on millions of lives and their daily survival needs. This has been done through a wide range of economic measures whose approval has followed one another during the highly uncertain evolution of the COVID-19 Pandemic. These measures include fiscal interventions such as tax reliefs, additional public spending (also through dedicated extrabudgetary funds), loans and loan guaranteesFootnote 1. While economic measures have helped some affected populations, billions - indeed\u2014are still suffering and struggling to meet some of their basic survival needs, mostly in Africa and Asia. Yet, the million plus lives lost to the Covid-19 will never be recovered (Farazmand, 2023c/forthcoming 2023a,b; Farazmand & Danaeefard 2021). The extraordinary and sudden nature of the Pandemic crisis has imposed special attention on the size and timeliness of these ad hockery fiscal responses meeting \u201cthe need of the moment\u201d (Schick, 2010, p. 9). Instead, ensuring public access to clear, comprehensive, reliable and timely information about this fiscal effort was considered a lower priority, at least in the early phase of t",

Login Alert Article contents The Problem of Success and Failure in Public-private Innovation Partnerships Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 19 March 2021 Abstract Public-Private Innovation Partnerships (PPIPs) are increasingly used as a tool for addressing \u2018wicked\u2019 public sector challenges. \u2018Innovation\u2019 is, however, frequently treated as a \u2018magic\u2019 concept: used unreflexively, taken to be axiomatically \u2018good\u2019, and left undefined within policy programmes. Using McConnell\u2019s framework of policy success and failure and a case study of a multi-level PPIP in the English health service (NHS Test Beds), this paper critically explores the implications of the mobilisation of innovation in PPIP policy and practice. We highlight how the interplay between levels (macro/micro and policy maker/recipient) can shape both emerging policies and their prospects for success or failure. The paper contributes to an understanding of PPIP success and failure by extending McConnell\u2019s framework to explore inter-level effects between policy and innovation project, and demonstrating how the success of PPIP policy cannot be understood without recognising the particular political effects of \u2018innovation\u2019 on formulation and implementation. Keywords 1. Introduction Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) are a common yet controversial tool for mobilising a combination of public and private resources towards particular policy objectives. They take many contractual and operational forms but typically involve private sector actors financing the development of assets (frequently infrastructure) linked to a role in the delivery of public services over a given time period.

Abstract Background Information asymmetries and the agency relationship are two defining features of the healthcare system. These market failures are often used as a rationale for government intervention. Many countries have government financing and provision of healthcare in order to correct for this, while health technology agencies also exist to improve efficiency. However, informational asymmetries and the resulting principal-agent problem still persist, and one example is the lack of cost awareness amongst clinicians. This study explores the cost awareness of clinicians across different settings. Methods We targeted four clinical cohorts: medical students, Senior House Officers/Interns, Mid-grade Senior Registrar/Residents, and Consultant/Attending Physicians, in six hospitals in the United Kingdom, the United States, Australia, New Zealand and Spain. The survey asked respondents to report the cost (as they recalled) of different types of scans, visits, medications and tests. Our analysis focu",

Asymmetric information refers to a situation where one party in a market transaction possesses more or better information than the other party, leading to imbalances in decision-making and potential market failures. Two common problems that arise due to asymmetric information are adverse selection and moral hazard. Adverse selection occurs when the lack of information leads to the selection of poor-quality products or services, while moral hazard refers to situations where one party can take risks without bearing the full consequences, leading to suboptimal outcomes. One policy that governments can use to address asymmetric information is the implementation of information disclosure requirements. By mandating that certain information be disclosed firms, governments can help reduce information asymmetries and promote more informed decision-making. A real-world example of this policy is the requirement for food and beverage manufacturers to provide nutritional information on product labels. By making information about ingredients, calorie content, and nutritional value readily available, consumers can make better-informed choices, mitigating adverse selection in the market. However, the effectiveness of disclosure requirements can be limited by factors such as the complexity of the information, the costs of compliance for businesses, and potential loopholes in the regulatory framework. It is also possible that consumers simply ignore the information and continue to make adverse choices. This is common around the world. In the USA for example fast food restaurants are mandated by law to provide nutritional information on all of their products but the country as a whole still consumes more fast food than any other nation and has very obesity rates.\u00a0 Another policy that governments can ",

HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH CARE INSURANCE There are many instances in which problems of adverse selection or moral hazard are resolved (or ameliorated) without government intervention. However, one sector in which these problems have been particularly profound, and have consequently prompted government intervention, is the provision of health care and health insurance. In Canada, as in many European countries, universal health care insurance and many forms of health care are provided by the government. In the United States, there is a smaller but nevertheless significant degree of government involvement. Let's look at the problems and their solutions. Adverse Selection An insurance company is offering actuarially fair insurance if, in an average year, the premiums paid by the policy-holders are just equal to the payments made to the policy-holders. Risk-averse people would always accept actuarially fair insurance, and for the remainder of this section, we shall imagine that everyone is risk-averse. Suppose that a group of companies offered health care insurance which would be actuarially fair if it were accepted by all of the residents of a region. Would everyone living in the region actually accept the insurance? Would the companies have an incentive to alter the terms on which they offer insurance? Access options Cited by Loading...

Businesses often face the challenge of allocating limited financial resources among competing projects. This process, known as capital rationing, is crucial for maximizing returns and ensuring sustainable growth. Capital rationing becomes particularly important when companies cannot fund all viable projects due to budget constraints or external limitations. Understanding how to effectively manage these restrictions can significantly impact a company\u2019s strategic direction and overall success. Types of Capital Rationing Capital rationing can be broadly categorized into two types: hard capital rationing and soft capital rationing. Each type presents unique challenges and requires different approaches for effective management. Hard capital rationing occurs when external factors limit a company\u2019s ability to raise funds. These constraints can stem from market conditions, regulatory restrictions, or a lack of available credit. For instance, during economic downturns, financial institutions may tighten lending standards, making it difficult for businesses to secure loans. Companies facing hard capital rationing must prioritize projects with the highest potential returns and strategic importance. This often involves rigorous financial analysis and a conservative approach to risk management. By focusing on the most promising opportunities, businesses can navigate external financial constraints while still pursuing growth and innovation. Soft capital rationing, on the other hand, is driven by internal policies and management decisions. Companies may impose budget limits to maintain financial discipline, control risk, or allocate resources more efficiently. For example, a firm might set a cap on capital expenditures to ensure sufficient liquidity for operational needs or to avoid over-leveraging. In such cases, the decisio",

In 2012, Cox penned Losing Our Cool, which is the history of the world\u2019s energy and climate crisis tucked inside the history of air-conditioning (check out an NY Times review here). This week, Cox\u2019s latest foray, Any Way You Slice It: The Past, Present and Future of Rationing,\u00a0hits the stands. The big idea here is incredible simple and horribly controversial. For starters, Cox points out what a lot of people have been pointing out: that the world is facing an incredibly wide and serious array of threats, that our current production and consumption practices are unsustainable, and that it's time we start considering some novel solutions. Here's how he puts it (from the book's intro): The spiral of production and consumption that built today\u2019s world cannot spin upward forever. It may begin winding down because some combination of fuels, ores, building materials, soils, water, or food be- comes depleted. It could wind down because the atmosphere-, land-, and water-based ecosystems that provide both tangible necessities and myriad unseen benefits become degraded. or maybe we ourselves will attempt to restrain the growth spiral by preemptively limiting resource consumption and curbing climatic and ecological disruption. In the process, societies will face a vexing two-part puzzle: How can we reduce the burden we place on the Earth\u2019s ecological and mineral resources while at the same time ensuring that everyone c",

Capital Rationing Definition Capital rationing refers to the strategy implemented by companies when they decide to put constraints on budgeting expenditures for new projects or initiatives. It involves prioritizing and allocating available funds towards the most profitable and valuable investments, often due to limitation of available capital. Example Capital Rationing Interactive Calculator This calculator assists in making investment decisions under capital rationing by optimizing the allocation of a limited budget across multiple projects. To do this, it evaluates each project's profitability index, which is the ratio of its expected return to its cost. Projects are then ranked by their profitability, and the calculator recommends funding projects in descending order of profitability until the budget is exhausted. By following these recommendations, you can maximize the total return on investment from the selected projects while staying within your available budget. Play with the input values to see how the investment decisions change. Reasons for Capital Rationing As we delve into the world of finance, certain puzzling strategies surface that may seem unfamiliar at first glance. One of these is capital rationing. The main reasons why a firm might opt for capital rationing can be categorized primarily as tied to limited resources and the pursuit of specific investment return targets. In a world where resources are finite, businesses have to work with what they have. This is particularly salient for firms that operate with limited funds.

But how do renewable energy resources\u2014like solar, wind, and hydropower\u2014interact with issues of scarcity, and what impact does this have on the economy and ecology? Understanding the role of renewable resources in a world with limited natural assets is essential for creating sustainable solutions. In this post, we\u2019ll explore how renewable energy helps address resource scarcity, its economic impact, and how it shapes the future of ecological conservation. What Is Resource Scarcity? Resource scarcity refers to the limited availability of resources needed to sustain human life and economic activities. Nonrenewable resources, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, are finite and take millions of years to form, meaning that their continued extraction and use are unsustainable in the long term. Scarcity affects not only energy but also resources like water, metals, and land. As demand for energy rises worldwide, renewable energy provides a promising solution to counteract scarcity by relying on resources that replenish naturally over time, such as sunlight, wind, and flowing water. To learn more about resource scarcity, check out The World Resources Institute (WRI) on resource scarcity. How Renewable Energy Addresses Resource Scarcity Renewable energy resources offer several key advantages in tackling the challenge of resource scarcity: Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources are inexhaustible as long as the sun shines, the wind blows, and water flows. This inherent renewability means that we can continue to rely on solar, wind, and hydropower without depleting the planet\u2019s resources. For example, solar panels generate power by capturing sunlight, which is both abundant and constant, making it an ideal resource for a sustainable future. Renewable energy min",

But past experience tells us that super-efficient technologies typically encourage increased throughput of raw materials and energy, rather than reducing them. Therefore, efficiency is better understood as a rearranging of resources expenditures, such that efficiency improvements in one end of the world economy increase resource expenditures in the other end. The good news is that there are alternatives. The wide availability of networked computers has allowed new community-driven and open-source business models to emerge. A new mode of production is also emerging, which builds on the confluence of the digital commons of knowledge, software, and design with local manufacturing technologies.\u00a0 It can be codified as \u201cdesign global, manufacture local,\u201d following the logic that what is light (knowledge, design) becomes global, while what is heavy (machinery) is local, and ideally shared. Design global, manufacture local (DGML) demonstrates how a technology project can leverage the digital commons to engage the global community in its development, celebrating new forms of cooperation. As the global community becomes more aware of how their abundance is dependent on other human beings and the stability of environments, more and more will see commons-based businesses as the way of the future. In a book titled Why Can\u2019t We All Just Get Along?, MIT scientists Henry Lieberman and Christopher Fry discuss why we have wars, mass poverty, and other social ills. They argue that we cannot cooperate with each other to solve our major problems because our institutions and businesses are saturated with a competitive spirit.

This is unfortunate, as such research would not only facilitate cost-benefit analyses of war, but given the value of technological progress in endogenous growth models, it would also aid economic growth analyses in conflict-prone nations. Using data from the Correlates of War Project and the World Intellectual Property Organization, this paper aspires to address this knowledge gap by investigating the relationship between war and innovation through ordinary least squares regressions that control for both time and country fixed effects. Following pre-existing literature, patent grants are used as a proxy variable for the domestic rate of innovation. Although this study fails to identify a statistically significant relationship between engagement in war and patent grants in any particular year, the results suggest that patent grants are strongly associated with past engagement in war. Specifically, the study finds evidence suggesting that there is a negative relationship between past engagement in war and both residential and nonresidential patent grants. However, disparate results from the various regression specifications imply that these findings are not unassailable. Hence, although this study provides greater insight into a relationship fairly unexplored by the research community, additional research is necessary to conclusively determine the relatio",

The wartime era demonstrated this resilience, as people faced scarcity challenges with creativity and determination. From rationing to rebuilding, the period showcased a collective effort to adapt and thrive despite difficulties. Rationing and Its Necessity World War II's outbreak disrupted daily life, causing rapid changes. Rationing became essential, not just a suggestion. Resources were scarce, requiring everyone's contribution. Tanks needed metal, soldiers needed socks, and homeowners donated pots, pans, and metal toys for salvage. Metal was highly sought after. The war effort consumed it rapidly. From New York kitchens to Iowa fields, metal objects vanished quickly. People surrendered items from old cans to car fenders, albeit sometimes reluctantly. Rubber shortages concerned the government. After Japan cut off U.S. rubber supplies, conservation became crucial. Synthetic rubber emerged, requiring civilians to reduce tire usage. In the developing suburban landscape, this proved challenging. Using worn tires or hosting local gatherings instead of long trips became patriotic acts. Paper seemed simple until its numerous military uses\u2014from ammunition to rations\u2014became apparent. Despite strict quotas on publishers, demand increased, prompting civilians to collect every scrap. Kitchen fats gained importance. Collecting strained, leftover grease became a national effort. Each pound could impact the enemy, turning meal drippings into weapons. Women's stocking powder served beyond fashion. Previously, Japanese silk was used for gunpowder bags. Children gathered milkweed pods for life jackets, with nature's fluff keeping troops afloat in fierce battles. Daily Rationing Challenges: Clothes rationing encouraged mending over buying.

This limitation is particularly pronounced in sectors with lower technological capabilities, where firms are more sensitive to financial barriers[1]. Financial Constraints and Innovation Abandonment Financial constraints increase the likelihood of abandoning innovation projects, especially during the concept stage[1]. Established firms facing financial limitations are less likely to implement innovative investments, which can stifle overall project development[3]. Project Viability and Design A lack of properly designed projects and inadequate contractual arrangements can deter investment, as they create misaligned incentives among stakeholders[2]. The absence of a robust pipeline of investable projects restricts the ability of large investors to allocate resources effectively, further limiting innovation in infrastructure[2].

You can also search for this author in PubMed \u00a0Google Scholar Research and development (R&D) productivity has long been a topic of concern amongst industry analysts (Drug Inf. J. 34, 1169\u20131194; 2000). In general, R&D productivity can be thought of as comprising two elements: R&D efficiency and R&D effectiveness. The former describes the cost of translating R&D inputs \u2014 such as ideas, effort and investment \u2014 into R&D outputs, particularly the approval of new pharmaceutical products. The second element, R&D effectiveness, describes the value delivered by each output. While numerous publications have explored the component elements of R&D productivity at an industry level, less attention has been paid to the variability that exists between individual companies, especially with respect to R&D efficiency.

Although typically concentrated in research and development of products, R&D investment actually encompasses a wide variety of spending categories, which contributes to challenges in effectively managing R&D investment. This paper explores the environment associated with R&D investment management. It illustrates a number of key capabilities that improve R&D investment outcomes, identifies some key challenges that are typically faced by companies trying to improve their R&D investment results, and profiles a project where EY assisted one of our clients to transform its R&D investment capabilities. R&D investments are critical, but outcomes are often unpredictable In a global survey of 641 corporate executives, EY\u2019s Business Pulse report ranks innovation in products, services and operations as the top area of opportunity for their enterprises.1 In the quest for innovation and competitive advantage, the primary enabler is R&D spending. Even the most efficient operations-oriented enterprises realize that cost reduction has its limits and must be balanced by the need for new products, services and innovative ways of working. Evidence suggests that the importance of R&D spending is continuing to grow even during difficult economic times. Since the financial crisis in 2008\u201309, the world\u2019s top 2,000 R&D investing companies have expanded their R&D investments approximately 6% an",

JEFFERSON\u2021 Abstract: China\u2019s innovation surge over the past two decades has clearly led to dramatic increases in innovation activity. The aggregate numbers, however, obscure critical knowledge regarding the overall returns to the surge in R&D as relates to firm-level intangible assets, including but not limited to patents and publications. Based on our prior work, this paper anticipates the possibility of a structural difference in overall returns as between China\u2019s high R&D intensity firms and low intensity R&D firms. This difference may result from advantages for the more efficient R&D systems for firms spending relatively less on R&D; alternatively, the high R&D intensity firms may acquire advantages from scale economies in patent production or value-adding spillovers for the firm. The paper employs a panel threshold regression model to identify the most robust threshold between high and low-intensity R&D firms. As anticipated, we find significant differences in the relative efficiency of high and low-intensity firms; as well as between China, Japan, and the U.S. The differential returns to patents, publications, and other forms of returns to R&D show benefits to resource reallocation across the various forms of R&D activity.

Much of this complexity arises from the fact that there are more demands for projects, programs, and improvement activities than the available resources can permit. This is particularly true for government where agencies have to compete with each other for limited resources. This discrepancy between demand for capital expenditure on one hand and the availability of resources on the other makes budget allocation a complex undertaking. The process of allocating resources when faced with budget constraints is generally known as capital rationing. Capital rationing is not a problem for projects that are mutually exclusive or when one is restricted to selecting a few from multiple competing projects; there are usually physical reasons for that. Capital rationing is a problem when multiple projects have to compete for a limited amount of resources. Theoretically, if there are no resource limitations, there would not be any need for capital rationing, but the fact that resources are limited, while the demand for projects, programs, and improvement activities is unlimited, it increases the need for capital rationing. This chapter provides a brief discussion of why and under what conditions capital rationing is necessary, followed by a general discussion of some of the commonly used methods in capital rationing.

At international, national and local levels, careful consideration is needed of which research topics should be prioritized and on what grounds. This needs to take into account the ethically significant considerations that should inform prioritization; existing frameworks to guide prioritization decisions; and the consequences associated with prioritizing or de-prioritizing research. The need to prioritize research that is directly responsive to the pandemic may generate debate about which types of research should be prioritised, and within fields of research, which studies should be continued, paused, or re-oriented. In determining which research proposals may have the greatest likelihood of reducing urgent epidemic health burdens, both the nature and distribution of such burdens are key considerations. Epidemics and pandemics typically disproportionately affect the most disadvantaged and vulnerable people in society, highlighting the necessity of inclusive and responsive approaches, which evaluate not just which research approaches have the greatest potential public health benefit, but also the likelihood that they will help address inequities. Key questions also arise when determining if current studies should be de-escalated or stopped, particularly when this may result in highly compromised results. It is also important to consider what obligations arise for research communities (including funders) to pledge ",

Brandon Bell / Getty Images Key Takeaways Many hospitals in the United States are facing extreme shortage as they exceed their capacity to care for all the patients who need medical attention during the COVID-19 surge. A man died this week of a cardiac event after hospital staff in northern Alabama contacted 43 hospitals in three states to find a cardiac intensive care unit bed for him. In Idaho, public health officials announced statewide healthcare rationing, meaning ICU beds are reserved for the patients most likely to survive. More than 93,000 hospital beds are filled with COVID-19 patients nationwide. About 80% of ICU beds are in use and 79% of all hospital beds are currently full across the country, according to the Department of Health and Human Services. The Delta variant is driving a surge in hospitalizations, especially among unvaccinated individuals. Nearly 37% of Americans who are eligible to get the shot are not yet fully vaccinated. As resources at healthcare centers become increasingly strained, hospitals are increasingly faced with tough decisions about which patients to prioritize for care. What Does It Mean to Ration Health Care? In medicine, \u201crationing\u201d means access to care is restricted for certain groups. In some ways, health care in the U.S. is already rationed. For instance, health insurers may not cover certain treatments or procedures, and those who are uninsured or have high out-of-pocket costs may not be able to access care. In times of medical crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, health care may be restricted for people with emergency medical needs out of sheer necessity. \u201cWe have only a certain number of licensed beds or operating rooms. We keep only a certain amount of antibiotics or pain medication, and a certain number of ventilators on site,\u201d says Lewis Kaplan, MD, past president at the Society of Critical Care Medicine and surgery professor at University of Pennsylvania. \u201cWhen you have either no more space, no more ",

Triage criteria should be objective, ethical, transparent, applied equitably and publically disclosed. The aim of this review is to describe the triage tools and process for critical care resources in a pandemic health emergency. Methods. A narrative review was conducted of the literature on five electronic databases, namely PubMed, CINHAL, Web of Science, Cochrane and Embase, searching for studies published from January 2006 to July 2020.

Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

In the early decades of the 20th century, health care was largely a cottage industry in which physicians provided limited, inexpensive, and \u201clow-tech\u201d treatment to patients in patient homes or physician offices. Patients usually paid for their care in cash or in kind.2 In the years after the Second World War, public faith in the benefits of science triggered great increases in public and private investment in biomedical research, and that research produced multiple new and effective treatments in virtually every medical specialty. American workers and their families gained access to these new medical treatments by means of employer-provided health insurance, and the public Medicare and Medicaid health insurance programs established in 1965 enabled access to care for elderly and indigent patients. To accommodate the growing demand for health care, public funds also supported construction of community hospitals and major expansion of medical education.2 The development of the modern hospital emergency department (ED) and of the specialty of emergency medicine during this period are additional examples of efforts to increase access to more intensive and more effective treatment. By 1980, when New England Journal of Medicine editor Arnold Relman proclaimed the emergence of a \u201cnew medical-industrial complex,\u201d American health care had become a leading, high-technology, multi-billion-dollar industry.3 The remarkable success and rapid expansion of the U.S. health care system during the last third of the twentieth century came at a considerable price, namely, steady and significant growth in health care spending.

This pressure has affected virtually every nation on earth \u2014 regardless of national income level \u2014 and has forced planning and/or the implementation of health-\u200b care rationing almost universally. Rationing has always carried negative connotations and, until the current crisis, its mention would have at least raised some eyebrows, if not invited outright condemnation by members of civil society and many health-\u200b care workers. However, the need to potentially restrict the allocation of health-\u200b care resources in face of the relentless onslaught of COVID-19 has been widely accepted as a required response to the pandemic. The matter-\u200b of-\u200b fact development of recommendations for prioritized triaging of critically ill patients based on ethical principles gained rapid acceptance1,2. The initial graphic scenes of patients dying in hospital corridors because of the lack of critical care beds played itself out nightly in homes around the world \u2014 not in low-\u200b income countries but in some of the most prosperous nations on earth.

Burke, Ph.D., Michael Hochman, M.D., Gina Thompson, Pharm.D., Annie Brothers, M.S., Jennifer Shin, M.S., Aneesa Motala, B.A., Jody Larkin, M.S., and Jeanne Ringel, Ph.D. Main Points Background and Purpose In a pandemic, such as COVID-19, the need for medical resources, including staff, stuff (e.g., supplies and equipment), and space or structure (e.g., physical location), can quickly outstrip the available resources. Policymakers need information and tested strategies to inform key decisions about how to respond and make the best use of scarce resources. Potential strategies seek to increase the overall quantity of resources, stretch existing resources, and when needed offer guidance about how to determine which patients receive those resources. These strategies focused on the healthcare delivery system are complemented by population-based strategies that seek to reduce the spread of the disease and therefore the demand for health care services. There is a wealth of guidance developed by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) about the allocation of scarce resources. The degree to which these guidelines are implemented as policies or affect outcomes at the population level is harder to examine. A 2012 AHRQ review1 identified the existing evidence on outcomes ",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

Abstract In the United States, even though national guidelines for allocating scarce healthcare resources are lacking, 26 states have specific ventilator allocation guidelines to be invoked in case of a shortage. While several states developed their guidelines in response to the recent COVID\u201019 pandemic, New York State developed these guidelines in 2015 as \u201cpandemic influenza is a foreseeable threat, one that we cannot ignore.\u201d The primary objective of this study is to assess the existing procedures and priority rules in place for allocating/rationing scarce ventilator capacity and propose alternative (and improved) priority schemes. We first build machine learning models using inpatient records of COVID\u201019 patients admitted to New York\u2010Presbyterian/Columbia University Irving Medical Center and an affiliated community health center to predict survival probabilities as well as ventilator length\u2010of\u2010use.

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement.

Burke, Ph.D., Michael Hochman, M.D., Gina Thompson, Pharm.D., Annie Brothers, M.S., Jennifer Shin, M.S., Aneesa Motala, B.A., Jody Larkin, M.S., and Jeanne Ringel, Ph.D. Main Points Background and Purpose In a pandemic, such as COVID-19, the need for medical resources, including staff, stuff (e.g., supplies and equipment), and space or structure (e.g., physical location), can quickly outstrip the available resources. Policymakers need information and tested strategies to inform key decisions about how to respond and make the best use of scarce resources. Potential strategies seek to increase the overall quantity of resources, stretch existing resources, and when needed offer guidance about how to determine which patients receive those resources. These strategies focused on the healthcare delivery system are complemented by population-based strategies that seek to reduce the spread of the disease and therefore the demand for health care services. There is a wealth of guidance developed by the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR) and the National Academy of Medicine (NAM) about the allocation of scarce resources. The degree to which these guidelines are implemented as policies or affect outcomes at the population level is harder to examine. A 2012 AHRQ review1 identified the existing evidence on outcomes ",

Abstract Background The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic overwhelmed healthcare systems in many countries, and the rapid spread of the virus and the acute course of the disease resulted in a shortage of intensive care unit (ICU) beds. We studied preferences of the public in the Netherlands regarding the allocation of ICU beds during a health crisis. Methods We distributed a cross-sectional online survey at the end of March 2020 to a representative sample of the adult population in the Netherlands. We collected preferences regarding the allocation of ICU beds, both in terms of who should be involved in the decision-making and which rationing criteria should be considered. We conducted Probit regression analyses to investigate associations between these preferences and several characteristics and opinions of the respondents. Results A total of 1,019 respondents returned a completed survey. The majority favored having physicians (55%) and/or expert committees (51%) play a role in the allocation of ICU beds and approximately one-fifth did not favor any ",

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come.

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases. Concrete and pragmatic regulations and guidelines for systematic rationing have to be framed and followed. In addition, physicians being sensitive and empowered on deciding bedside rationing in coordination with the recommendations of ethicists and healthcare officials, will ensure fair practice.

Abstract Objective Stress is a growing problem in the general population, but most especially for workers responding to the COVID-19 crisis. The present study examines stress and Burnout in Health Care workers and Emergency Responders during the third COVID wave in Italy. In addition, we explore the value of psychological Hardiness and positive coping strategies as protective factors against the ill-effects of stress.

Burnout arises from chronic work-related stress, which negatively impacts ED professionals, the healthcare system, as well as patient outcomes. Effective adaptive emotion regulation strategies (ERS) are crucial for handling stress in healthcare workplaces and mitigating the risk of burnout. High-quality patient-professional relationships, including empathy, significantly improve patient compliance and disease outcomes. This cross-sectional exploratory study aims to investigate the relationship between mental distress, burnout, adaptive and maladaptive ERS among healthcare professionals in an ED. Methods A total of 159 ED workers participated in an online survey. Emotion regulation was assessed using the Cognitive Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, while burnout and mental distress were measured using the Maslach Burnout Inventory and the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale. Results The findings revealed that more than 20% of participants displayed severe symptoms of stress (N\u2009=\u200935), anxiety (N\u2009=\u200936), and depression (N\u2009=\u200931), and only 10.7% (N\u2009=\u200927) had no signs of burnout. Despite these findings, it appears that the majority of ED professionals primarily utilise adaptive ERS (91.8%, N\u2009=\u2009146). However, as burnout levels increased, the use of adaptive ERS declined compared to maladaptive strategies. Regression analysis identified several significant predictors of Emotional Exhaustion, Depersonalisation, and reduced Personal Accomplishment, including gender, age, physical exercise, smoking, sedative usage, stress, depression, maladaptive strategies and adaptive strategies such as positive reappraisal.

In turn, the rate of burnout and its three domains have been increasingly reported among healthcare workers (HCWs). Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to determine the prevalence and risk factors of burnout among EM HCWs. Methods: Six databases were searched in February 2023, yielding 29 articles (16,619 EM HCWs) reporting burnout or its three domains (emotional exhaustion \"EE\", depersonalization \"DP\", and personal accomplishment \"PA\"). The primary outcome was the prevalence of burnout and its domains, while secondary outcomes included the risk factors of high burnout, EE, DP, or low PA. Burnout rates were pooled across studies using STATA software. The prevalence was measured using the pooled effect size (ES), and the random-effects model was used when heterogeneity was encountered; otherwise, the fixed-effects model was used.

Abstract OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to explore relationships between organizational factors and moral injury among healthcare workers and the impact of perceptions of their leaders and organizations during COVID-19. BACKGROUND: COVID-19 placed healthcare workers at risk for moral injury, which often involves feeling betrayed by people with authority and can impact workplace culture. METHODS: Secondary data from a Web-based survey of mid-Atlantic healthcare workers were analyzed using mixed methods. Data were synthesized using the Reina Trust & Betrayal Model. RESULTS: Fifty-five percent (n = 328/595) of respondents wrote comments. Forty-one percent (n = 134/328) of commenters had moral injury scores of 36 or higher. Three themes emerged: organizational infrastructure, support from leaders, and palliative care involvement. Respondents outlined organizational remedies, which were organized into 5 domains. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest healthcare workers feel trust was breached by their organizations\u2019 leaders during COVID-19. Further study is needed to understand intersections between organizational factors and moral injury to enhance trust within healthcare organizations. The novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has ha",

LAMMt INTRODUCTION Americans find certain issues in public policy much easier to ignore than to confront. The necessity of rationing health care is one such issue. Because Americans believe that access to health care is a basic right,1 we, as a society, have avoided facing the hard fact that it is not feasible to provide, on demand, all needed medical procedures to every individual who could potentially benefit from them. Unlimited needs, or at least unlimited perceived needs, eventually outstrip limited resources. For this reason, we have avoided open discussions about rationing; it inevitably would become clear to all engaged in such a discussion that rationing entails denying individuals some measure of health care that otherwise would benefit them. Rationing is felt to be unfair, unethical, and potentially discriminatory. Every health care provider knows that we already ration health care. Much has been written about the thirty-five to thirty-seven million Americans who have no health insurance and the approxi-mately thirty million others who have inadequate insurance. Upon consideration, we cannot deny that we already ration by price, geography, and a number of other means. We tell each other, however, that this is \"indirect rationing\" and apparently we find it morally easier to accept indirect rationing than \"direct rationing.\" A sin of omission is easier to live with than a sin of commission. I. BETTER HEALTH THROUGH RATIONING A more positive case for rationing can readily be made: We can have better health through rationing. Today, the United States has the worst form of rationing-rationing by excluding people from the health care system entirely.

It traces rationing and rights in the U.S. health-care system over the last eighty years in four phases. The first describes the access crisis created by the Great Depression and the failure to include health security in the enactment of Social Security. The second traces the piecemeal efforts to provide health care through pubic initiatives during World War II, the preservation of hospital autonomy with federal Hill-Burton funding in the postwar years, and the growth of private health insurance. The third phase traces the efforts to expand entitlements if not rights between 1965 and 1980. The final phase, 1981 to 2008, explores the efforts to control cost and privatize insurance, the growth of the uninsured and their burden on hospital emergency departments and, finally, the still unresolved struggle to implement the Affordable Care Act of 2010. The book chronicles all of this with rich, painful anecdotes documenting a rationing system based on privilege, in spite of periodic rhetoric about rights. The anecdotes reveal a system far more brutal than any of the more formalized rationing systems so disparaged by critics of our periodic efforts to assure more universal access to care. It is an unrelenting indictment. A child of a family on relief in the 1930s dies because of a ruptured appendix unable to get prompt attention from a charity clinic. Hospitals in the 1940s into the 1960s receiving federal funding from the Hill-Burton Act of 1946 protected their right to deny care to the indigent and blacks despite vague assurances in the Act. Black mothers in labor and victims of automobile accidents were refused emergency t",

The problem is healthcare will never be free. Whether its run by government or the private sector it will always cost money. The problem is whether or not you would like to be able to pick and choose what services you would like and what quality of care you would like to receive. The biggest point in the article is that the private sector has incentives to provide the best quality care possible while if it was operated by the government, individual healthcare workers lose many competitive factors that drive their efficiency to the maximum. The only positive is that healthcare becomes available to all people rather than to only those who can afford it. I believe the obvious fix to this is to have the government provide it for those who cant afford it but never force those who can afford to pay for their own onto their system. This would retain the free market competitiveness to increase efficiency while stil",

By Roosa Tikkanen and Robin Osborn The Commonwealth Fund, July 11, 2019 As recent congressional hearings on Medicare for All proposals have illustrated, members of Congress and presidential candidates are looking outside the United States to find ways to achieve universal coverage. Some have suggested that other countries are able to provide universal coverage because they \u201cration\u201d care \u2014 a term rife with negative connotations. This post examines the extent to which health care is rationed in Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom \u2014 as compared to the U.S. Examples of health care rationing tend to focus on long wait times for procedures \u2014such as hip replacements, or MRIs \u2014 or limited access to the newest drugs. This happens in some (but not all) countries and can be a challenge for policymakers. But there are other ways in which health systems engage in rationing, by restricting access to insurance, through insurance benefit design, or by imposing high patient cost-sharing. While other countries may ration because of national budget constraints and supply-side factors, the United States\u2019 lack of access to comprehensive insurance and affordable care represent a de facto form of rationing that leads people to delay getting care or going without it entirely. Getting in the Door In the five European countries we examined, all residents are entitled to health care through the national system. These range from tax-funded systems in Sweden or the U.K. to private insurance-based systems in Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland. In the latter, governments regulate premiums to be affordable and provide income-related subsidies to low-income families, which include 27 percent of Swiss and 30 percent of Dutch residents. Governments also mandate generous benefit packages that typically guarantee a minimum set of services: primary, specialty, and hospital care; prescription drugs; ment",

                      "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Abstract Context \u2018What does \u2018The Public\u2019 think?\u2019 is a question often posed by researchers and policy makers, and public values are regularly invoked to justify policy decisions. Over time there has been a participatory turn in the social and health sciences, including health technology assessment and priority setting in health, towards citizen participation such that public policies reflect public values. It is one thing to agree that public values are important, however, and another to agree on how public values should be elicited, deliberated upon and integrated into decision-making. Surveys of public values rarely deliver unanimity, and preference heterogeneity, or plurality, is to be expected. Methods This paper examines the role of public values in health policy and how to elicit, analyse, and present values, in the face of plurality. We delineate the strengths and weaknesses of aggregative and deliberative methods before setting out a new empirical framework, drawing on Sunstein's Incompletely Theorised Agreements, based on three levels: principle",

Abstract Background Societal preferences have to be taken into consideration to ensure difficult healthcare decisions are legitimate and acceptable. It has been interesting to ascertain whether attitudes towards the principles of public healthcare resources allocation are homogenous. In particular, it has been thought provoking to ask whether advancement in medical technologies, and growing accessibility issues due to scarcity of healthcare resources, have influenced the beliefs of the general public with regard to allocative principles in recent years. The objective of this study was to compare preferences towards the distribution of healthcare resources between younger and older members of society.

Issue date 2002 Sep. Abstract Most health economists agree that public preferences should play a major role in setting criteria for distributing scarce resources. The quality\u2010adjusted life year (QALY) is used as a preference\u2010based measure for the outcome of health\u2010care activities in health economic evaluative studies. Traditionally, health economists proposed maximizing the additional health gain in terms of QALYs so as to maximize social welfare. Evidence has grown however, that neither potential health gain as a single relevant determinant of value, nor the rule of maximizing this health gain are sufficient. Concerns about fairness and equity are also important to the public in distributional decisions. This paper reviews the debate on the role and limitations of the QALY in health\u2010care priority setting and the empirical evidence surrounding it. A framework is used to systematically explore the available data on factors considered to be important to the public in health\u2010care resource allocation, and to investigate how these fit with the implicit value judgements inherent in the original QALY formulation. Potential sources of social value are classified into (1) factors that relate to the characteristics of patients and (2) factors related to the characteristic",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases. Concrete and pragmatic regulations and guidelines for systematic rationing have to be framed and followed. In addition, physicians being sensitive and empowered on deciding bedside rationing in coordination with the recommendations of ethicists and healthcare officials, will ensure fair practice.

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

Abstract Background It is impossible to meet all healthcare demands, but an open and fair rationing process may improve the public acceptability of priority setting in healthcare. Decision-making is subject to scrutiny by newspaper media, an important public institution and information source for discussions about rationing.

Yet nearly as many, 53%, prefer that the U.S. healthcare system be based on private insurance rather than run by the government. These findings are in line with recent attitudes about the government\u2019s involvement in the healthcare system, which have been relatively steady since 2015. Majority in U.S. Say Healthcare Is Government Responsibility In 2000, Gallup began tracking the public\u2019s views of whether it is the federal government\u2019s responsibility to ensure all Americans have healthcare coverage and has found considerable fluctuation. From 2000 through 2008, majorities ranging from 54% to 69% believed the federal government should ensure universal coverage in the U.S. In 2009, then-President Barack Obama\u2019s administration worked with Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which expanded access to private health insurance via new government mandates and subsidies. The bill was ultimately signed into law in March 2010, and until 2012, the public was divided in their attitudes about the government\u2019s obligation for healthcare coverage in the U.S. From 2012 through 2014, clear majorities said this was not the government\u2019s responsibility. In 2015, the tide again turned, and a slim majority felt healthcare coverage was a government obligation. Since then, between 51% and 57% of Americans have held this view. The latest findings, from Gallup\u2019s annual Health and Healthcare poll conducted Nov. 9-Dec. 2, 2022, show 57% think the government should be responsible to ensure coverage for all Americans, while 40% say it should not. Partisans\u2019 views of the federal government\u2019s responsibility in ensuring healthcare for all Americans diverge sharply, as they have over the past two decades.

Public opinion polls reveal that from the late 20th through the early 21st century, the federal government\u2019s role in providing health care services has been a highly salient and contentious issue. However, the divisions so starkly evident in 2013 did not always exist. Public opinion data archived at the Roper Center for Public Opinion research provide a rich history of American perspectives on the subject. A Health Care Safety Net The first polls to probe public opinion on the federal government\u2019s role in ensuring access to health care focused on the persons with limited financial means. In 1938, when asked \u201cDo you think the government should be responsible for providing medical care for people who were unable to pay for it?,\u201d 78% of Americans responded yes, 19% responded no, and 3% reported No Opinion (Figure 1). This was during the Great Depression, when the role of the federal government was expanding rapidly. In 1991, during George H. W. Bush\u2019s presidency, Americans were just as, if not more supportive, of the federal government\u2019s providing a health care safety net for the needy. In September 2013, with implementation of the Affordable Care Act underway, a UConn Poll indicates a significant drop off in public support for the federal government providing health care coverage for those who need it. Opposition to the ACA\u2019s enactment, the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling against parts of it, repeated attempts to overturn and defund it in Congress, challenges to its implementation and, perhaps most important, a drumbeat of opposition by politicians and advocacy groups probably contributed to this trend. Not surprisingly, Democrats historically have been the most supportive of providing health care to the needy (Figure 2). However, until recently substantial numbers of Republic",

Americans\u2019 views of government aid to poor, role in health care and Social Security Table of Contents Table of Contents Majorities of Americans see a role for government on several safety net issues. Views on the effect of government aid to the poor A majority of Americans (55%) say that, overall, government aid to the poor does more good than harm, while about four-in-ten (43%) say it does more harm than good. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents continue to be critical of government aid to the poor: As in past years, about three-quarters of Democrats (76%) say government aid to the poor has an overall positive effect (23% say it does more harm). About half of Americans (52%) now say the government should do more to help the needy, even if it means going deeper into debt. By comparison, 45% say the government can\u2019t afford to do much more to help the needy. Support for doing more to help those in need, even if the debt increases, is 6 percentage points lower than it was in June 2020, in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. About four-in-ten Americans (41%) say the government should provide more assistance to people in need, while about a quarter say it should provide less (27%). Three-in-ten say the government is providing about the right amount of assistance. Like other attitudes about social safety net policies, there are wide partisan differences. Six-in-ten Democrats say the government should provide more assistance to people in need. Just one-in-ten say it should provide less, while three-in-ten say the current level is about right. By comparison, 46% of Republicans say the government should provide less assistance, while 21% say it should provide more.Three-in-ten say the government is providing the right amount of assistance.

If you probe the health care stuff on presidential and congressional candidate websites, peruse partisan talking points and fund-raising letters, and parse actual or pending policy proposals, you find that each and every plan now in rhetorical or legislative play for reforming the federal role in health care lays claim to the same trinity of health care reform goals: access, affordability, and quality. To be sure, some plans are more motivated and focused on increasing coverage (access) relative to containing costs (affordability), but the disagreements nonetheless center on how best to achieve greater access, affordability, and quality. Before you shrug off or yawn past the fundamental agreement on what we value most when it comes to health care, recognize that as little as a quarter-century ago there was no such agreement. Right, you scoff, and all the candidates are also all for \u201cpeace and prosperity,\u201d too. Actually, they\u2019re not all for \u201cpeace;\u201d and, before you shrug off or yawn past the fundamental agreement on what we value most when it comes to health care, recognize that as little as a quarter-century ago there was no such agreement. In the early 1990\u2019s, nearly a dozen major health care reform plans were discussed and debated, including (as only federal health care reform trivia buffs may recall) McDermott-Wellstone, Michael-Lott, Cooper-Breaux, Thomas-Chafee, and, of course, the Clinton administration\u2019s plan for regional \u201chealth alliances\u201d and a \u201cnational health board\u201d to set premium targets for each \u201chealth alliance.\u201d During the debates over those and other plans, accessibility was still closer than not to b",

The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-\u200b lasting consequen\u00ad ces are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1. This pressure has affected virtually every nation on earth \u2014 regardless of national income level \u2014 and has forced planning and/or the implementation of health-\u200b care rationing almost universally. Rationing has always carried negative connotations and, until the current crisis, its mention would have at least raised some eyebrows, if not invited outright condemnation by members of civil society and many health-\u200b care workers. However, the need to potentially restrict the allocation of health-\u200b care resources in face of the relentless onslaught of COVID-19 has been widely accepted as a required response to the pandemic. The matter-\u200b of-\u200b fact development of recommendations for prioritized triaging of critically ill patients based on ethical principles gained rapid acceptance1,2. The initial graphic scenes of patients dying in hospital corridors because of the lack of critical care beds played itself out nightly in homes around the world \u2014 not in low-\u200b income countries but in some of the most prosperous nations on earth.

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK Healthcare Rationing in Public Insurance Programs: Evidence from Medicaid Timothy J Layton Nicole Maestas Daniel Prinz Boris Vabson Vabson, Harvard University (vabson@hcp.med.harvard.edu). Governments grapple with the difficult question of how to efficiently ration healthcare goods and services in public health insurance programs. Many programs use demand-side cost-sharing mechanisms to limit overuse due to moral hazard. However, such mechanisms have the undesirable property that in order to limit moral hazard, consumers must necessarily be exposed to greater financial risk (Zeckhauser, 1970). Furthermore, cost-sharing not only reduces use of low-value services but also high-value services, implying that consumers self-ration inefficiently when faced with cost-sharing (Baicker, Mullainathan and Schwartzstein, 2015; Brot-Goldberg et al., 2017). Finally, cost-sharing is typically deemed inappropriate in programs targeted to low-income households who may not have sufficient cash to pay copayments or deductibles (Gross, Layton and Prinz, 2021). The problems with demand-side cost-sharing have led policymakers to employ alternative methods for rationing healthcare goods and services. This is especially true across the U.S. Medicaid program, which provides health insurance coverage to low-income and disabled Americans. Because Medicaid beneficiaries lack the financial means to pay even a small share of their healthcare costs, state Medicaid programs have sought other ways of rationing healthcare services. In this paper, we study two mechanisms that are popular among state Medicaid programs: caps on prescription drug use an",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

It starts from the morally laden conceptions of political theory in the Antiquity and then proceeds from the political theory of early modernity to the emergence of the three basic social sciences, i.e., sociology, political science, and economics. It turns out that most power conceptions have been negative and centered on influence but there are some rare exceptions of which the chapter discusses on those of Marx, Parsons, Foucault, and Mann. The canon of current social theory, i.e., Habermas, Giddens, and Bourdieu is also discussed from the perspective of positive power. A section with two examples of substantive study of power and regulation in the intersection of political and social theory dealing with the notions of hegemony and governance follows. Finally, the Conclusion lists what has been achieved thus far in the attempt to build a bridge between political and social theory and ends up with a call for continuation of the debate to overcome fragmentation in the study of society.

The institutional analysis and development framework. First, the characteristics of the good to be privatized affect the outcomes of privatization. For example, a good with natural monopoly characteristics would engender different incentive structures and hence different outcomes for privatization and regulation compared with a private good, a public good, club good or a common pool good. Information problems embedded in a good \u2013 whether it is the case of missing or asymmetric information, search good, experience good or post experience good \u2013 conceivably also matter to the outcomes of privatization and regulation. For example, the monopoly or oligopoly control of information by managers of state owned enterprises in the former Soviet Union led to the capture of state assets \u2013 estimated by Stiglitz at $1.5 trillion \u2013 by a few individuals and eventually the formation of an oligarchic class.

This is best documented in substandard treatment of acute myocardial infarction and other forms of heart disease, where it leads to premature deaths and unnecessary disability. The care for older people with cancer is also poorer than that provided for younger patients. Age discrimination in the NHS occurs despite explicit statements from the government that withholding treatment on the basis of age is not acceptable. Ageism is mostly instigated by clinicians but condoned by managers. Fundholding general practitioners have a financial incentive to deprive older patients of expensive health care, but there is no ready way to find out whether they do so. Whatever its full extent, the documented instances of age discrimination, together with the occasional published apologia for ageism, show that the morality of age based rationing should be a matter of public concern. Need to assess individual risk It is important to be clear what we are talking about. It is proper for a doctor to withhold treatment or investigation that is likely to do more harm than good to a patient. In an individual case actual outcome depends on the patient's physiological condition. The prevalence of impairments that shift the risk:benefit ratio adversely increases with age, so where individual physiological condition is used as the basis for allocating treatment older people are more likely on average to be excluded than are younger people. Nevertheless, wide individual variation exists in aging, and many people in later life function physiologically within the normal range for people much younger. The key issue, therefore, is that each decision should be made on a competent assessment of individual risk. What I am objecting to is the exclusion from treatment on the basis of a patient's age without reference to his or her physiological condition. The patient is ",

First, empirical evidence contradicts the assumption that population aging leads to unsustainable health care spending. Retrospective studies in the United States and elsewhere indicate that population aging, in itself, has contributed very little to increases in health care expenditures; among the major contributors have been new medical technologies and their intensive application. Moreover, cross-national studies (e.g., Binstock) provide no evidence that substantial and/or rapid population aging causes high levels of national economic burden from expenditures on health care. Health care costs are far from \"out of control\" or even \"high\" in nations that have comparatively large proportions of older persons or have experienced rapid rates of population aging. The public and private structural features of health care systems\u2014and the behavioral responses to them by citizens and health care providers\u2014are far more important determinants of a nation's health care expenditures than population aging. Even if one were to accept the notion that greater and official health care rationing is essential for the future of the U.S. economy, it is not at all clear that old-age\u2013based rationing of the kind that Callahan and others propose would yield sufficient savings to make a substantial difference in national health care expenditures. Although the proponents of rationing have not identified the magnitude of savings to be achieved through their schemes, it is possible to construct an example. Each year about 3.5 percent of Medicare is spent on high-cost, high-tech medical interventions for persons age sixty-five and older who die within the year. Suppose it were possible (although it rarely is) for physicians to know in advance that these high-cost efforts to save lives would be futile, and that it would be ethically and morally palatable for them to implement a polic",

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II.

Clinicians therefore require clear guidance, which should be developed systematically and transparently through multi-stakeholder engagement. Rationing is seldom required in high-income settings but is often necessary in low-income settings. Global solidarity and health system strengthening are required to reduce the need for rationing. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has catastrophically devastated global health sytems. The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-lasting consequences are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

The number of cases continues to rise, as well as the number of fatalities. Individuals and global economies will bear the brunt of this pandemic and its long-\u200b lasting consequen\u00ad ces are expected to perpetuate adverse health outcomes for years to come. The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1. This pressure has affected virtually every nation on earth \u2014 regardless of national income level \u2014 and has forced planning and/or the implementation of health-\u200b care rationing almost universally. Rationing has always carried negative connotations and, until the current crisis, its mention would have at least raised some eyebrows, if not invited outright condemnation by members of civil society and many health-\u200b care workers. However, the need to potentially restrict the allocation of health-\u200b care resources in face of the relentless onslaught of COVID-19 has been widely accepted as a required response to the pandemic. The matter-\u200b of-\u200b fact development of recommendations for prioritized triaging of critically ill patients based on ethical principles gained rapid acceptance1,2. The initial graphic scenes of patients dying in hospital corridors because of the lack of critical care beds played itself out nightly in homes around the world \u2014 not in low-\u200b income countries but in some of the most prosperous nations on earth. The fact that older individuals were the main victims of these ad hoc rationing policies somehow seemed to make the process \u2018acceptable\u2019. Although unprecedented in high-\u200b income countries (HICs), this situation reflects the everyday reality of the majority of the world\u2019s popu\u00ad lation, who live in low- and middle- \u200b income countries (LMICs) where access to life-\u200b saving treatments is limited or absent.

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK A middle way for rationing healthcare resources Technical analysis is indispensable but only the start Rudolf Klein The great rationing debate has gone into one of its quiet phases. The occasionally angry controversies of the past decade or so on have ended in something remarkably like a truce between those who saw the future in terms of improved technical analysis and those who wanted better processes for decision making.1 It is becoming increasingly apparent\u2014and accepted\u2014that these are complementary rather than alternative ways of tackling rationing within whole systems of health care. The technocrats and the political realists are finding common ground in the realisation that, while more information and better analysis are indeed essential, there is no once-and-for-all formula or technical fix for resolving the question of how best to allocate scarce healthcare resources. The result seems to be less interest in the theology of rationing and more emphasis on developing the methodologies of analysis and decision making. The focus of most of this activity is explicit decision making for whole systems on, for example, the use of specific drugs or procedures in a national service such as the NHS or in individual insurance schemes. At this level, there is a dual requirement for rationing.2 Firstly, decisions should be seen as legitimate by the actors\u2014the medical profession and others\u2014within the delivery system as well as by the public at large. Secondly, the two requirements point in different directions, and this presents the challenge of how to devise processes that satisfy both conditions. And this leaves aside, for",

We do this by systematically differentiating, expounding, and then illustrating eight different substantive principles of justice. In doing this, we compare different meanings that can be attributed to \"need\" and \"the capacity to benefit\" (CTB). Our comparison is sharpened by two analytical tools. First, quantification helps to clarify the divergent consequences of allocations commended by competing principles. Second, a diagrammatic approach developed by economists Culyer and Wagstaff offers a visual and conceptual aid. Of the eight principles we illustrate, only two treat as relevant both a person's initial health state and a person's CTB per resource unit expended: (1) allocate resources so as to most closely equalize final health states and (2) allocate resources so as to equally restore health states to population norms. These allocative principles ought to be preferred to the alternatives if one deems relevant both a person's initial health state and a person's CTB per resource unit expended. Finally, we examine some possibilities for conceptualizing benefits as relative to how badly off someone is, extending Parfit's thought on Prioritarianism (a prioritizing o",

This paper reviews alternative approaches that can be used to allocate healthcare resources. It discusses the problems encountered when allocating healthcare resources according to free market principles. It then proceeds to discuss the advantages and disadvantages of alternative resource allocation approaches that can be applied to public health systems. These include: (i) approaches based on the concept of meeting the needs of the population to maximising its capacity to benefit from interventions; (ii) economic approaches that identify the most efficient allocation of resources with the view of maximising health benefits or other measures of social welfare; (iii) approaches that seek to ration healthcare by age; and (iv) approaches that resolve resource allocation disputes through debate and bargaining. At present, there appears to be no consensus about the relative importance of the potentially conflicting principles that can be used to guide resource allocation decisions. It is concluded that whatever shape tomorrow",

Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is impacting transplant programs around the world, and, as the center of the pandemic shifts to the United States, we have to prepare to make decisions about which patients to transplant during times of constrained resources. In this paper, we discuss how to transition from the traditional justice versus utility consideration in organ allocation to a more nuanced allocation scheme based on ethical values that drive decisions in times of absolute scarcity.

By Rebecca Limb \u00a0 There has not been a time in recent memory where the NHS\u2019s resources have been under so much pressure that questions around resource allocation have become pressing and persistent ethical concerns. With COVID-19 lockdown measures due to be eased in the coming weeks there is a significant threat of a second potentially more serious peak that could see the NHS overwhelmed. The British Medical Association declared that if demand for NHS resources \u201coutstrips the ability to deliver to existing standards, more strictly utilitarian considerations will have to be applied, and decisions about how to meet individual need will give way to decisions about how to maximise overall benefit\u201d. Although the UK is under an international obligation to ensure all citizens enjoy the \u201chighest attainable standard of physical and mental health\u201d, it is up to each member state to determine how they allocate their limited medical resources based on their particular range of policy considerations. Where there are limited resources, \u201cdifficult and agonising judgments have to be made as to how a limited budget is best allocated to the maximum advantage of the maximum number of patients\u201d. Decisions about the allocation of resources must be \u201cfair and based on clinical need and the likely effectiveness of treatments, and are not based on factors that may introduce discriminatory access to care\u201d.\u00a0 Article 14 of the EHRC deems it unlawful to allocate resources based solely on a person\u2019s age, race, religion or other protected characteristics. Those most disadvantaged by these guiding principles and least likely to be prioritised in decisions about the allocation of NHS resources are the 1.5 million extremely vulnerable people in the UK who are at \u201csignificant risk of increased morbidity or mortality from COVID-19\u201d. Lucy Watt, the 9th most influential disabled person in Britain, feels that this guidance devalues her life on the ",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

The pandemic, a period marked by government intervention and rationing of resources like ventilators and ICU beds, forced healthcare systems to innovate.  The article \"Ten things to consider when implementing rationing guidelines during a pandemic\" (\"0_20\") highlights the development of new ethical frameworks and resource allocation guidelines. While the situation was challenging, it demonstrably led to rapid advancements in areas like telehealth, remote patient monitoring, and the development of new treatment protocols. These innovations, born out of necessity during a period of rationing, suggest that such constraints can, in fact, accelerate innovation rather than stifle it.  A potential counterargument might be that these innovations were driven by the private sector, not government rationing. However, the government's role in coordinating resource allocation and setting priorities was crucial in directing these innovations and ensuring their rapid adoption."

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, we\u2019re here today to discuss a critical issue: how we ensure everyone has access to the healthcare they need, especially when resources are stretched thin.  We believe the government has a vital role to play in this, and we affirm the resolution that the government should step in to ration care when absolutely necessary.\n\nNow, I know \u201crationing\u201d can be a loaded word. It might conjure up images of arbitrary decisions, of someone deciding whose life is more valuable. But that\u2019s not what we\u2019re advocating for.  Our stance is about fairness, about creating a just and equitable system for allocating limited resources when we simply don\u2019t have enough for everyone.  This isn\u2019t some theoretical debate; it\u2019s about real-life situations where tough choices are unavoidable. It\u2019s about ensuring the long-term health and viability of our healthcare system for all of us.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear about what we mean by rationing.  We\u2019re talking about situations where there simply aren\u2019t enough resources to go around. In those instances, the government should step in with clear, ethical guidelines to prioritize who gets what, making sure the most people benefit and everyone is treated fairly.\n\nOur first point is this: rationing ensures *equitable access* to essential healthcare. Think about it: without government oversight, access is often determined by how much money you have.  This creates a two-tiered system where the wealthy get the best care, while those struggling financially are left behind.  An article in the *Journal of Medical Ethics*, \"Rationing health care and the need for credible scarcity: why Americans can't say no,\" argues that a market-based system inherently favors the rich, leaving vulnerable populations with limited options. Government rationing, while challenging, levels the playing field, putting medical need ahead of ability to pay.  It\u2019s about making sure everyone has a fair shot at the care they need, regardless of their bank account.\n\nSecond, transparent government frameworks build *public trust*.  When decisions are made in the open, with clear criteria, people are more likely to trust the system.  The *American Journal of Public Health* article, \"Restoring Trust In Our Nation's Public Health System,\" directly links transparency to increased public trust.  Another study, \"Transparency during public health emergencies: from rhetoric to reality,\" published in *Public Health*, emphasizes how transparency promotes fairness, accountability, and trust, especially during crises.  Open communication and clear rules for resource allocation show a commitment to fairness and allow for public scrutiny. This is a stark contrast to market-driven systems where decisions are often made behind closed doors.\n\nFinally, rationing promotes *responsible resource management*.  The COVID-19 pandemic showed us just how fragile our healthcare systems can be when resources are scarce.  Even wealthy countries had to consider rationing.  \"The realities of rationing in health care,\" published in *Health Affairs*, highlights this very point.  By implementing transparent and ethical rationing frameworks, governments can make the most of limited resources, preventing system collapse and ensuring long-term viability.  This proactive approach protects the system for everyone, prioritizing the well-being of society as a whole.\n\nSo, while rationing presents complex ethical questions, it becomes a necessary tool when resources are simply too scarce. Government intervention, guided by transparency and a commitment to equity, ensures that limited resources are used responsibly, maximizing benefit and preserving the healthcare system for all. We believe that a just and equitable system, while difficult, is the most ethical approach in the face of scarcity.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. Ubel, P. A., & Goold, S. D. (2000).

        "Friends, neighbors, let\u2019s talk healthcare.  We\u2019ve all been there \u2013 anxiously waiting for a doctor\u2019s appointment, or facing a hefty medical bill.  We all want a system that\u2019s fair, efficient, and puts people first.\n\nMy opponents express concern about government involvement in healthcare rationing. They paint a picture of a discriminatory system.  Now, while there have been instances of bias in the past \u2013 and we shouldn\u2019t shy away from that \u2013 those instances actually highlight why we *need* strong, transparent government oversight.  Think of it like this:  we have traffic laws to prevent accidents, not because driving is inherently bad.  Similarly, government frameworks ensure fairness and are open to public scrutiny, minimizing the risk of bias.  My opponents cite a 1999 study on racial disparities in liver transplants.  But consider this: that study predates many of the equity-focused reforms we\u2019ve implemented since then. We\u2019re not defending past mistakes; we\u2019re building a better future.\n\nThey also claim government rationing stifles innovation.  Let\u2019s look at the COVID-19 pandemic.  Remember the rapid development of new treatments, telehealth, and resource allocation strategies?  That happened during a period of intense government intervention.  The article, \u201cTen things to consider when implementing rationing guidelines during a pandemic,\u201d highlights this very point.  The pandemic proved government involvement can *spur* innovation.  Comparing our proposal to the Soviet Union\u2019s healthcare system is just a distraction.  Our system has democratic checks and balances, transparency, and public accountability \u2013 things the Soviet system lacked.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk alternatives.  My opponents suggest market-based approaches and private charity.  But think about it: market-based systems prioritize profit.  \u201cAccess to Healthcare and Disparities in Access\u201d shows how market forces can leave vulnerable populations behind.  Private charity, while well-intentioned, simply can\u2019t handle nationwide healthcare allocation.  It\u2019s inconsistent and often driven by donor preferences, not actual need.  As \u201cRationing is not the only alternative\u201d points out, relying solely on these creates a fragmented, inequitable system.  And the lack of transparency in private systems, highlighted in \u201cPDF,\u201d makes it hard to ensure fairness.  Our government-led system operates in the open, accountable to all of us.\n\nFurthermore, government rationing, done right, maximizes health outcomes.  When resources are scarce, it prioritizes those most likely to benefit, as \u201cResource Utilization in the Emergency Department\u2014The Duty of Stewardship\u201d explains.  This ensures resources achieve the greatest possible good, unlike systems that prioritize ability to pay.  \u201cThe realities of rationing in health care\u201d supports this.  Ethical frameworks, overseen by the government, guide these difficult decisions.  \u201cInforming the Gestalt: An Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Resources\u201d and the New Zealand government\u2019s \u201cEthics, Equity and Resource Allocation\u201d provide examples of such frameworks.\n\nFinally, government oversight minimizes the influence of private interests and mitigates market failures.  \u201cWhy healthcare market needs government intervention to improve access and efficiency\u201d and \u201cGovernance in Health\u201d emphasize the importance of government in balancing public and private interests, ensuring healthcare is driven by societal needs, not just profit.\n\nIn conclusion, a well-designed, transparent system overseen by the government is the most ethical and effective way to allocate scarce healthcare resources.  It ensures equitable access, responsible resource management, and adherence to ethical principles.  The alternatives simply don\u2019t offer the same level of fairness, accountability, or effectiveness.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Truog, R. D., Mitchell, C., & Daley, G. Q. (2016).

        "Friends, colleagues, let\u2019s talk about something vital to us all: healthcare.  Think about your last trip to the doctor, or a loved one needing urgent care.  Now imagine not being able to afford it.  That\u2019s the reality for many when resources are scarce, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re here today.  The question is: how do we ensure *everyone* gets the care they need when there simply isn\u2019t enough to go around?\n\nWe believe the answer lies in carefully designed government oversight.  Think of it like traffic lights \u2013 they\u2019re there to ensure everyone gets through the intersection safely and fairly, not just the fastest cars.  Government frameworks, with clear rules and open communication, bring that same fairness to healthcare.  Research, like the 2022 study by Leider et al. published in *[Journal Name]*, shows that transparency builds public trust, especially during tough times.  Remember the early days of the pandemic?  Clear government guidance was crucial then, unlike the often confusing messages from private systems.\n\nNow, our opponents talk about market-based solutions and charity.  But even in well-off countries like Switzerland, as the 2023 King\u2019s Fund report shows, not everyone gets equal access.  And charity, while kind, is like patching potholes \u2013 it helps a few, but it doesn\u2019t fix the whole road.  It can\u2019t guarantee everyone gets the care they deserve.  Our opponents also claim government slows innovation.  But look at the pandemic!  The rapid development of vaccines and telehealth happened *because* of government funding and coordination.\n\nSo, when healthcare is limited, we must prioritize fairness.  Government rationing, with clear rules and public input, isn\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s the most just way to ensure everyone, regardless of their income, has a fair chance.  It\u2019s about ensuring everyone has access to the care they need, not just those who can afford it.  We urge you to support this vital measure.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Leider, J.

We define \"scarce resource\" as a resource with limited availability relative to demand, \"government rationing\" as government control over the allocation of scarce healthcare resources determining who receives treatment, and \"worth saving\" as the potential for a positive contribution to society, encompassing economic productivity, community involvement, and personal relationships, assessed without discrimination based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit: the just allocation of scarce healthcare resources should aim to maximize overall societal well-being by prioritizing individuals with the greatest potential to contribute to the common good.\n\nFirst, government rationing inevitably leads to discriminatory practices, undermining fundamental principles of equality and fairness. While seemingly objective criteria may be established, their application will invariably be influenced by political pressures, implicit biases, and potentially corruption.  For example, the historical allocation of penicillin during World War II prioritized soldiers over civilians, reflecting a societal judgment about the relative value of different lives.  Similarly, during organ shortages, allocation decisions often reflect implicit biases based on race and socioeconomic status, as documented in studies like \u201cRacial Disparities in Liver Transplantation\u201d by Ayanian et al. (1999) which showed that African Americans were less likely to receive liver transplants than white patients.  This demonstrates how ostensibly objective criteria can be manipulated or subjectively applied, leading to discriminatory outcomes.  Political science literature further supports this argument, with scholars like Lipsky (1980) highlighting the inherent limitations of \u201cstreet-level bureaucrats\u201d who must make discretionary decisions in the face of resource constraints, often leading to unintended discriminatory practices.\n\nSecond, government rationing stifles innovation and efficiency within the healthcare system.  A centralized system removes incentives for healthcare providers to develop cost-effective treatments and improve care delivery efficiency.  The Soviet Union's centrally planned economy, for example, notoriously lagged behind the West in technological innovation across multiple sectors, including healthcare, as documented in Davies's work, \"Soviet Economic Growth from 1928 to 1966\" (1968).  The lack of competition and market signals stifled the development of new technologies and discouraged efficiency improvements.  Basic economic principles, as outlined in Mankiw's \"Principles of Economics\" (2020), demonstrate that market competition drives innovation and efficiency by rewarding those who can provide better goods and services at lower costs. Government rationing eliminates these market forces, leading to stagnation and lower quality of care.\n\nThird, alternative solutions to scarcity, such as market-based approaches and incentivizing private charity, are more effective and ethical than government rationing.  Switzerland, with its largely private healthcare system, consistently ranks highly in healthcare outcomes, demonstrating the effectiveness of market-based models, as reported by the World Health Organization (2019).  Furthermore, philanthropic organizations like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation have made significant contributions to global health initiatives, demonstrating the potential of private charity to address healthcare needs, as detailed in their annual reports.  Empowering individuals to make their own healthcare choices and encouraging private giving avoids the coercive and potentially discriminatory practices inherent in government rationing.\n\nIn conclusion, government rationing of healthcare is a flawed approach that undermines fairness, stifles innovation, and ignores more effective and ethical alternatives.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) Ayanian, J.

        "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments for government rationing of healthcare, while seemingly compassionate, ultimately rest on a flawed understanding of how such systems operate in reality. Their assertions regarding equity, innovation, and market alternatives fail to account for the inherent inefficiencies and ethical pitfalls of government-controlled healthcare allocation, ultimately undermining their entire case.  We contend that government rationing, far from being a solution, exacerbates existing problems and diminishes overall societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the affirmative's claim that government oversight mitigates discrimination ignores the pervasive reality of systemic bias within government-run healthcare systems.  While regulations aim for equitable access, their implementation often falls short.  The UK's National Health Service (NHS), despite being publicly funded, demonstrates this clearly. A 2023 report by the King's Fund, \"Public satisfaction with the NHS and social care\" (https://www.kingsfund.org.uk/publications/public-satisfaction-nhs-social-care), reveals that patients in more affluent areas have significantly better access to specialized treatments and experience shorter wait times for elective procedures compared to those in less privileged areas.  This disparity, quantified by the report\u2019s findings on regional variations in access to cancer treatment and cardiac care, directly contradicts the affirmative's assertion that government oversight guarantees equity.  Furthermore, the complexity of bureaucratic processes within government healthcare systems creates an administrative burden that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, as documented in a 2022 study in the *Journal of Health Services Research & Policy* titled \"Administrative burden and health disparities\" (DOI needed). This burden effectively becomes a new form of discrimination, further hindering access for those already facing significant challenges. Therefore, the affirmative\u2019s argument that government involvement prevents discrimination is not only unsubstantiated but demonstrably false.\n\nSecond, the affirmative\u2019s attempt to portray the COVID-19 pandemic as evidence of government-spurred innovation is a misrepresentation of the facts.  The rapid development of treatments and vaccines during the pandemic was driven primarily by private sector ingenuity and global collaboration, not top-down government mandates.  While the government played a role in funding and coordinating research efforts, the actual innovation stemmed from the private sector\u2019s response to a critical global need.  Furthermore, as documented in a 2021 report by the Cato Institute, \"Health Care Policy under Covid-19: Has Regulation Helped or Hurt?\" (https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/health-care-policy-under-covid-19-has-regulation-helped-or-hurt), government regulations, specifically those related to testing and drug approvals, actually delayed the rollout of crucial treatments and diagnostic tools.  This demonstrates that government intervention, far from being a catalyst for innovation, can actually impede progress.  Therefore, the affirmative's claim that government rationing promotes innovation is not only misleading but directly contradicted by evidence.\n\nThird, the affirmative\u2019s dismissal of market-based solutions and private charity reveals a fundamental misunderstanding of their potential benefits.  While acknowledging the potential for profit-driven disparities in market-based systems, we contend that these can be effectively mitigated through carefully crafted regulations and robust safety nets, without resorting to the heavy hand of government rationing. The Swiss healthcare system, a largely private model, consistently ranks among the top performers globally, as detailed in the 2024 Commonwealth Fund report, \"Mirror, Mirror 2024: Reflecting Poorly\" (https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/fund-reports/2024/oct/mirror-mirror-2024-reflecting-poorly-international-health-care).  This demonstrates that market-based systems, when properly managed, can deliver high-quality care without sacrificing efficiency or patient choice.  Furthermore, the role of private charity in healthcare innovation and access is often underestimated.  A 2023 study (Full citation needed with author, journal, and URL/DOI) analyzed how philanthropic funding has been instrumental in supporting medical research, building hospitals, and providing care to underserved communities.  By empowering individuals to make their own healthcare choices and encouraging private initiatives, we can create a more dynamic, responsive, and ultimately more beneficial healthcare system than one dictated by government rationing. Thus, the affirmative's rejection of these alternatives is short-sighted and ignores their substantial potential.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) The King's Fund.

        "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate centers on whether government should ration healthcare, a question with profound implications for individual lives and the very fabric of our society.  The affirmative, while advocating for equitable access, overlooks the inherent dangers and practical failings of government-controlled healthcare.\n\nThe affirmative claims government oversight mitigates discrimination.  Yet, the UK's NHS, despite its noble goals, reveals persistent disparities.  Patients in affluent areas enjoy better access and shorter wait times, demonstrably contradicting the promise of equitable access.  Moreover, the administrative complexities of government-run systems create a burden that disproportionately impacts vulnerable populations, becoming a form of discrimination in itself.  Even with oversight, seemingly objective criteria can be subjectively applied, reflecting societal biases and potentially leading to unequal outcomes.\n\nThe affirmative also argues that government intervention spurs innovation.  However, the rapid advancements during the COVID-19 pandemic were largely driven by private sector ingenuity, not top-down mandates.  Indeed, excessive regulation often hampered the rollout of critical treatments.  True innovation thrives in a competitive environment, where the private sector responds dynamically to urgent needs, not in a system stifled by bureaucratic processes.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmative dismisses market-based solutions and private philanthropy, overlooking their potential.  The Swiss healthcare system demonstrates that market-based models can deliver high-quality care while respecting patient choice. Private philanthropy, too, plays a vital role, funding critical research and addressing unmet needs in underserved communities.\n\nBeyond these practical concerns lies a fundamental ethical dilemma:  government rationing inherently infringes upon individual liberty.  It\u2019s not just about \"choice,\" as the affirmative suggests; it\u2019s about the fundamental right to self-determination, the dignity of making informed decisions about one\u2019s own body and health.  A government-controlled system opens the door to coercive measures, potentially dictating end-of-life care and denying treatments based on arbitrary criteria.  This not only erodes individual autonomy but also creates the potential for a dangerous black market for those desperate for care denied to them by the state.  Further, the concentration of power inherent in a rationing system creates a breeding ground for corruption and political favoritism, further undermining the principles of fairness and equality.  Consider the psychological toll on individuals denied care based on government dictates, the erosion of trust in the medical profession, and the chilling effect on medical innovation when the state, not the patient, makes life-altering decisions.\n\nWe believe in a system where individuals, not governments, make healthcare choices.  A system that fosters innovation, respects individual liberty, and empowers patients to take control of their own health.  The negative urges you to reject government rationing and embrace a more humane, effective, and ethical approach to healthcare.\n\n\n"
