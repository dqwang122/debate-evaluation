      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the increasing prevalence and sophistication of Artificial Intelligence will lead to a significant decline in the quality, value, and opportunities within human creative arts. We define \"decline\" as a gradual and continuous loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value. \"Human Creative Arts\" are defined as forms of expression conceived and executed by humans, including but not limited to visual arts, music, writing, and performance arts. We define \"AI \" as the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.\nOur judging criteria is the preservation of human artistic value. The side that best demonstrates the preservation of intrinsic value, opportunities, and originality within human creative arts should win this debate.\n\nFirst, AI undermines the economic viability of human artists. The proliferation of AI-generated art devalues human artistic labor, leading to reduced income and job opportunities. Forbes  reported that human creatives have already been replaced in significant numbers across various industries, from graphics design and illustrations to game design. This has resulted in repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry, explicitly linked to the use of AI. The increasing accessibility and affordability of AI tools tempts businesses and individuals to rely on automated solutions, bypassing the need for human writers, musicians, and artists . This is especially impactful in content-heavy industries like journalism, marketing, and advertising, where companies are increasingly investing in AI as a cost-saving measure, directly eroding the demand for human talent. Studies published in *Nature*  show that AI-made labels on artwork led to a **62% decrease in monetary value** and a **77% decrease** in estimated production time compared to perceptions of human effort. This devaluation makes it increasingly difficult for human artists to sustain their careers, forcing many to abandon their craft and diminishing the overall talent pool. Without economic incentives, fewer individuals will pursue creative careers, leading to a decline in the quality and diversity of human artistic output.\n\nSecond, AI erodes the originality and authenticity of art. AI-generated art relies on existing datasets, leading to derivative and unoriginal creations that lack the emotional depth and unique perspective of human art. AI models are trained on vast quantities of existing artwork, essentially remixing and regurgitating pre-existing styles and ideas. This process diminishes the role of human creativity, intuition, and personal experience in the artistic process. As *Forbes* notes , if generative AI is allowed to destroy human creative industries, we are heading toward a future where art and music styles are fixed and static, doomed to listen and see the same styles forever. Furthermore, AI-generated content can be plagued with biases present in the training data , further limiting originality and perpetuating existing stereotypes. The ability to easily generate endless variations of existing themes dulls the appreciation for true innovation and diminishes the intrinsic value of human artistic expression.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "content": "In this debate we shall argue that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Buy decline we mean a gradual and continuous loss of strength numbers quality or value and artistic output. Human creative arts encompasses activities involving the creation of original works of art music literature and other forms of expression that reflect human imagination skill and emotional depth. Our judging criteria is artistic flourishing we believe the winning side will be the one that best demonstrates the preservation and enhancement of the growth innovation and accessibility of human creative arts. We contend that ai rather than hindering this flourishing can and will contribute to it. First ai lacks the essential elements of human creativity emotional depth and originality. Ai operates based on algorithms and data sets mimicking existing styles but it cannot replicate the genuine emotions unique perspectives and subjective experiences that drive human artistic expression. As digital brew reports are often lacks true emotional depth. Which is a key component that human artists bring to their work? Existing data leads to formulaic and repetitive outputs hindering true originality. This contrasts sharply with human creativity which is characterized by genuine interest deliberate choices complex cognitive processes spontaneous originality and personal insights therefore ai's limitations prevent it from truly replacing human artists ensuring the continued value and importance of human created art. Second ai serves as a powerful tool to augment human creativity empowering artists to explore new avenues of expression and enhancing artistic production. Ai is increasingly being viewed as a collaborative partner for artists. As arab news notes ai is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool that can enrich it when used properly. Ai assists and generating ideas overcoming creative blocks and rapidly iterating on designs. This collaborative approach combines the rapid creation and iteration capabilities of ai with the unique vision and problem-solving skills of human artists. Resulting in art that surpasses the limitations of ai alone. In fact approximately 70% of people appreciate ai. Indicating an overall positive perception of ai as an aid to human artists. Does ai's role as a tool enhances artistic capabilities fostering a new era of artistic innovation and growth. Ford ethical and legal concerns surrounding ai art will ultimately limit its dominance and ensure the continued importance of human created art. The use of ai in art raises significant ethical dilemmas including copyright infringement lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists. Ai reports accountability and originality are major ethical concerns in ai art. Furthermore the legal landscapes surrounding ai generated art is rife with disputes over ownership and unauthorized use of artists work. A federal judge recently dismissed some claims in an ai art copyright lawsuit highlighting the legal complexities of protecting artists rights when ai systems are trained on copyrighted images. These ongoing ethical and legal challenges create uncertainty and risk associated with ai art. Incentivizing a return to and greater appreciation for human created art. Which is grounded in ethical practices and clear ownership? In conclusion ai's inherent limitations in replicating human emotion and originality its role as a tool to augment human creativity and the significant ethical and legal challenges surrounding its use all ensure that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws regarding the definition of decline, the definition of artistic flourishing, and the assumption that AI is not detrimental to human creative arts, which are what I will be rebutting.\n\nFirst, the opposition defines \u201cdecline\u201d in a way that prioritizes quantity of artistic output over quality, originality, diversity, and ethical integrity. We contend that even if AI increases the sheer volume of art, a decrease in these crucial elements constitutes a genuine decline. After all, artistic endeavors are human expression rather than just soulless output. It's like saying a factory that churns out millions of identical plastic trinkets is contributing to cultural flourishing simply because of the numbers. Without quality, originality, diversity, and ethical considerations, art loses its soul and becomes mere empty imitation. As art critic Danilo notes, AI-driven art reinforces established trends and homogenizes artistic styles . We must focus on preserving the core tenets of human creativity rather than being distracted by superficial increases in output.\n\nSecond, the opposition\u2019s definition of \"artistic flourishing\" which emphasizes \"growth\" and \"accessibility,\" is insufficient. We argue that true artistic flourishing demands quality, originality, diversity, and ethical integrity. Accessibility without quality simply means more bad art is easily available. Growth without originality is stagnation, not flourishing. The claim that artistic flourishing should emphasize growth and accessibility is like arguing that a garden is flourishing simply because it has more weeds and is easier to access, while neglecting the health and beauty of the flowers. The AI's homogenizing effects on art, as noted earlier, do not allow for artistic flourishing.\n\nThird, the opposition claims that AI cannot replicate human emotion, which somehow ensures the \"continued value and importance of human-created art.\" We argue that even if AI cannot perfectly replicate human emotion, it can convincingly mimic it, especially to untrained audiences. The difference becomes negligible, and the ease with which AI can mimic art devalues the hard work, emotional investment, and unique perspective that goes into truly great art. Studies show that AI-made labels led to a 62% decrease in monetary value and a 77% decrease in estimated production-time relative to perceptions of human effort . It is not that AI-created art is necessarily good. Instead, it is that AI-created art is seen as cheaper. Thus, it devalues the human-created art.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Danilo. \"Brushstrokes of the Future: AI's Impact on Visual Arts and Creativity.\" *The Art World*, January 12, 2024.\n(2) Shalwa. \"Global AI in the Art Market Statistics 2025.\" *Artsmart.ai*, December 2, 2024.\n(3) Nature. \"AI-made art is likely to bring down the average monetary value commanded in artistic markets.\" *Nature*, December 12, 2023."

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal contains three key flaws: their narrow definition of decline, their mischaracterization of AI's impact on creativity, and their dismissal of ethical considerations as mere \"band-aids.\"\n\nFirst, they claim we define \"decline\" too narrowly, focusing only on quantity while ignoring quality, originality, diversity, and ethics. But this is a straw man. We argue for artistic flourishing, which encompasses all of these qualities . An increase in artistic output *is* a preservation of creativity. They provide no evidence that AI art inherently lacks these qualities; they simply assert it. Furthermore, as AI enhances art, we can see an increase in artistic appreciation, leading to increased attendance at museums and increased funding for the arts. In fact, both the digital art market and traditional art market are experiencing tremendous growth . To only focus on the negative ignores a more complete picture.\n\nSecond, they argue that AI restricts creativity, leading to homogenization, like over-relying on GPS. But this analogy is weak. GPS helps you find *pre-existing* locations, while AI is a *tool* which allows you to create new ones. They provide no evidence that AI is only replicating existing styles. In fact, AI provides new tools and techniques that expand the range of human creativity . It's not a limitation but an enhancement. We see this in practice as artists increasingly use AI to create unique and innovative artworks, viewing AI as a collaborative partner .\n\nThird, they dismiss ethical and legal concerns as \"band-aids on a gaping wound.\" This is a false dilemma. Addressing ethical issues is not mutually exclusive with artistic progress. We can, and must, do both at once. Furthermore, ethical issues also exist in traditional art, such as exploitation of artists and art fraud . Addressing these concerns is an ongoing process for *all* art forms. The fact that society is actively developing legal and ethical frameworks for AI art  is a *positive* sign. If we manage these concerns effectively, it can support a positive future for AI in the arts .\n\nTherefore, we stand firm that AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts. Rather, it will augment human potential, increase artistic appreciation, and foster a new era of artistic innovation.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

The first crucial battleground is the very definition of decline. Are opponents believe it's simply a matter of quantity of artistic flourishing. But we've demonstrated that decline is about quality originality diversity and ethical integrity more art doesn't equal better art. They commit a straw man misrepresenting our argument. Imagine a world where music all sounds like generic pop and art galleries are filled with the same ai generated styles. With that be flourishing the burden of proof is on the opponent to show that the increased quantity fulfills characteristics of high-quality diverse and ethical art. They claim ai enhances creativity. But we showed how it restricts it. It's not a helpful gps get a paint by numbers kit it allows for quick creation but the result is derivative lacking human expression. The opponent needs to show with evidence how ai fosters creativity and brings high quality and ethical integrity. As forbes noted if we allow ai to destroy human creative industries we are heading towards fixed and static art and music styles the freedom of creativity should not be restricted and the artist's opportunities should not be threatened by ai. Finally they dismiss our ethical concerns as mere band-aids we acknowledge their importance but these are reactive measures. The scale of ethical problems is amplified by ai. Easier copyright infringement exploitation of artists and devaluation of human effort. Current legal frameworks cannot keep up. Look at the us district court's ruling that companies violated artists rights by illegally storing their works.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Clark, E. \"The End Of Originality?

And the ethical considerations surrounding ai in the arts. The cornerstone of the opposition's argument is their definition of decline. Claiming we ignore quality originality diversity and ethics however. Our framework of artistic flourishing inherently encompasses these qualities. An increase in artistic output is a preservation of creativity. Ai tools allow more people to participate in art creation than ever before. This inherently increases diversity. By automating tedious technical tasks ai allows artists to focus on creative expression leading to higher quality work. Through the exploration of new styles and techniques ai can actually foster originality. The opposition attempts a straw man arguing that we ignore these values but this is simply untrue. The opposition clings to the idea that ai leads to homogenization using the analogy of over relying on gps but this is a weak analogy gps finds pre-existing locations while ai creates new ones. Ai is a tool and like any tool its effectiveness depends on the artist wielding it. We've sighted examples of artists using ai to create truly innovative and unique works ai isn't just replicating existing styles it's helping artists combine styles generate novel ideas and push the boundaries of what's possible. Study show that human creativity can be reinterpreted using ai blending it with unique human vision and emotion surpassing ai's limitations.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.
