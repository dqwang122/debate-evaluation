      "content": "Good morning, everyone. We stand firm today in our assertion that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. AI's threat to originality, copyright, and diversity forms a perfect storm that will diminish the richness and value of human creative expression. To clarify, we define \"decline\" not as complete obliteration, but as a demonstrable reduction in originality, diversity, and ethical integrity within artistic output. These three values \u2013 originality, diversity, and ethical integrity \u2013 are the cornerstones upon which we will base our arguments.\n\nFirst, consider how AI's reliance on existing data stifles true artistic innovation. AI algorithms learn from vast datasets, inevitably reinforcing established trends and popular styles. This leads to a homogenization of artistic expression, discouraging artists from venturing into uncharted creative territories.  It\u2019s akin to a musician who exclusively listens to top-40 hits; their music will predictably mirror what's already on the radio, devoid of a unique and authentic voice. The heart of the matter is that genuine artistic innovation arises from experimentation, from fearlessly pushing boundaries, not merely replicating existing content. By prioritizing popular styles and established norms, AI curtails the exploration of truly unique and groundbreaking creative visions.\n\nSecond, AI art introduces complex copyright and ownership dilemmas. Determining the rightful owner of AI-generated art becomes exceedingly difficult, particularly when the AI is trained on pre-existing copyrighted material. This uncertainty discourages artists from fully embracing AI tools, fearing potential legal entanglements and intellectual property disputes. Imagine a sculptor hesitant to create, paralyzed by the fear of inadvertently infringing upon another artist's design. This legal ambiguity casts a shadow over the creative process, stifling artistic expression and innovation. More than half of artists worry that generative AI will have a detrimental effect on their revenue . The concern suggests that artists fear AI might devalue human-made art or increase competition in the art market.\n\nThird, AI-driven creative tools have the potential to amplify existing societal biases. If the data used to train AI reflects inherent biases, the art it generates will likely perpetuate those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities within society. This is not merely a matter of algorithms; it's about the potential for perpetuating societal inequities through artistic mediums. It\u2019s like a hall of mirrors, reflecting and amplifying distorted images, thereby undermining the diversity of artistic voices and ultimately contributing to a decline in the richness and originality of human creative arts.\n\nWe anticipate the opposition will argue that AI enhances creativity by providing new tools and possibilities. However, this argument is flawed. While AI can generate outputs, it lacks the conscious intention, lived experience, and critical reflection that fuels truly meaningful art. True creativity demands originality, ethical considerations, and a diverse range of voices \u2013 all of which are jeopardized by the increasing dominance of AI in the arts. As we move forward, it is imperative that we critically evaluate AI's role in the arts, ensuring that it serves to enhance, not diminish, the unique power and potential of human creativity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Danilo. \"Brushstrokes of the Future: AI's Impact on Visual ... - The Art World\". *The Art World*, January 12, 2024.\n[2] Shalwa. \"Global AI in the Art Market Statistics 2025 - Artsmart.ai\". *Artsmart.ai*, December 2, 2024."

      "content": "We stand firmly against the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We understand the concerns about AI potentially displacing artists or diminishing the value of human-created art. However, we believe these fears are based on a misunderstanding of both art and artificial intelligence.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \"decline.\" Our opponents define it as a loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value. We argue that this definition is too narrow. Art is constantly evolving, and AI is simply the latest catalyst in that evolution. A more accurate understanding of \"decline\" considers the transformation of art forms, which AI actively facilitates. Similarly, their focus on \"artistic integrity\" limits human expression, rather than accepting that AI enhances creativity and offers new avenues for exploration.\n\nNow, let's address their specific claims. They argue that AI diminishes the value and originality of human art. This argument assumes that because an algorithm is simple, the art it produces must also be simple. It also sets an unreasonably high standard by requiring 'lived experiences' as the sole source of emotional depth in art.\n\nThey also claim that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. This assumes that the art world is a fixed pie, where any gains for AI mean losses for human artists. This ignores the potential for AI to expand the market and diversify audiences. It also disregards the historical evolution of art through technological innovation.\n\nFinally, they raise ethical concerns about copyright. These concerns are not new. Copyright issues surrounding AI art are similar to historical debates around photography and music sampling. While copyright concerns exist, there are potential solutions such as AI art licensing platforms or collaborative agreements between artists and AI developers that can help protect artists' rights.\n\nIn contrast, we believe AI offers tremendous benefits. First, AI democratizes art creation. Just as the piano, once exclusive to the elite, became accessible to all through technological advancement, AI art generators lower the barrier to entry for artistic expression. Individuals without traditional skills can now create and share their visions.\n\nSecond, AI art challenges our understanding of creativity and authorship, sparking philosophical debates that enrich our understanding of art itself. The emergence of AI-generated art forces us to re-evaluate traditional notions of creativity, skill, and originality, leading to richer discussions about the essence of art. The works of AI art challenge traditional notions of creativity, authorship, and artistic expression, while sparking critical conversations about AI\u2019s impact on society, culture, and the arts .\n\nThird, AI can help artists connect with new audiences. AI algorithms can analyze social media trends and suggest optimal posting times and hashtags, helping artists reach a wider audience and promote their work. AI-powered visual content creation tools are also going mainstream . Text-to-image AI models have been revolutionizing the way visual content is created .\n\nIn conclusion, AI is not a harbinger of decline, but a catalyst for growth and evolution in human creative arts. For artists in the audience, AI can provide new tools to expand your creative capabilities and reach wider audiences.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Filimowicz, Michael. \"The Ten Most Influential Works of AI Art.\" *Medium*, June 4, 2023.\n[2] Darbinyan, Rem. \"How AI Transforms Social Media.\" *Forbes*, March 16, 2023."

      "content": "Let's be clear: we've defined \"decline\" as a reduction in the quality, value, or importance of human creative arts, and our emphasis on artistic integrity is not a constraint, but a necessary standard. The opposition avoids the central question: does AI truly enhance or degrade human creative skills?\n\nRegarding value and originality, they suggest we're concerned about simple algorithms. However, the core issue is that AI art relies on existing works, leading to derivative outputs devoid of genuine emotional depth. It mimics, it doesn't originate.\n\nOn opportunities for artists, they claim AI expands the market. But this argument ignores the displacement of human artists. They claim AI expands the market, but consider that stock photo sites decimated the livelihood of many freelance photographers. AI will likely do the same for illustrators and graphic designers, flooding the market with cheap, AI-generated content. Where is the true opportunity when human artists are replaced by algorithms?\n\nConcerning copyright, they draw parallels to photography. But the scale of AI's copyright infringement is unprecedented. AI models are trained on massive datasets of copyrighted material without the consent of the original creators. This is not a matter of isolated incidents; it's a systemic ethical violation.\n\nNow, let's address their key arguments. They assert that AI democratizes art. But democratization without skill and training leads to dilution and homogenization. It's like adding too much water to orange juice: you increase the volume, but you lose the concentrated flavor and nutritional value. The result is a watered-down version of art, accessible to all but satisfying to none.\n\nThey argue that AI challenges our understanding of creativity. But does it truly challenge or simply diminish it? Re-evaluating art to accommodate machine outputs lowers the bar for human artistic achievement. It suggests that algorithms can replicate the nuances of human expression, which is simply not true.\n\nThey propose that AI connects artists with audiences. But this connection is a mirage. AI prioritizes popularity over artistic merit, sacrificing genuine expression for algorithm-driven trends. It creates an echo chamber where art is judged not by its intrinsic value but by its ability to generate clicks and shares.\n\nAI doesn't uplift art; it undermines it. It offers short-term gains at the expense of long-term artistic integrity. We must actively support human artists, prioritize art education, and demand ethical AI practices to protect the future of human creativity. We must champion the unique qualities that define human art: the emotional depth, the personal expression, and the skilled execution that no algorithm can replicate. The world needs human art because it reflects our shared humanity, our struggles, our triumphs, and our dreams. It connects us to one another and to something larger than ourselves. AI art, on the other hand, is a sterile imitation, devoid of soul and meaning.\n\nThe future of human creative arts relies on defending its value, integrity, and opportunity. And AI, in its current form, does not support this in any way. It threatens to replace human artists with machines, to dilute artistic expression with algorithms, and to undermine the very foundations of human creativity. We must resist this trend and fight for a future where human art continues to thrive.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Stock photo sites decimated the livelihood of many freelance photographers."

      "content": "The opposition's arguments, while presented with conviction, ultimately fail to demonstrate that AI will precipitate a decline in human creative arts. Their position is built upon a foundation of questionable assumptions and a restrictive understanding of both artistic expression and technological progress.\n\nLet's begin with their interpretation of \"decline.\" They fixate on a single, limiting definition that emphasizes loss and degradation. However, art is not a static entity; it is a dynamic and ever-evolving process. The *Oxford Learner's Dictionary*, while a valuable resource, offers only one perspective among many. Other definitions highlight transformation and change, such as \"to become smaller, weaker, or less important\" . To disregard the transformative potential of AI is to fundamentally misunderstand the very nature of artistic evolution. We are not witnessing a decline, but a *transformation*, where AI unlocks unprecedented creative avenues.\n\nTheir concern for artistic integrity is similarly narrow. Are we to believe that only human hands can craft art imbued with genuine integrity? Such a stance is precarious in our increasingly technological world. The true beauty of AI lies in its capacity to offer novel avenues for artistic exploration. We should embrace it as an integral component of the artistic process, not fear it.\n\nNow, let's address their specific claims. They assert that AI diminishes originality. But this is a misrepresentation of the reality. They accuse us of creating a straw man argument, yet they themselves construct one by implying that we believe all art is simplistic. This is a gross distortion of our position. AI does not inherently stifle originality; rather, it serves as a powerful tool that artists can wield to generate novel and innovative works.\n\nFurthermore, they claim that AI will uniquely expand the art market, but this is not entirely accurate. While human art will undoubtedly continue to thrive, its growth is inherently limited by the constraints of human capacity. AI, on the other hand, possesses the potential to transcend these limitations, opening up new markets and opportunities that would otherwise remain inaccessible.\n\nFinally, they contend that the copyright issues surrounding AI-generated art are so unprecedented that they will prove insurmountable. This assertion simply does not hold water. Throughout history, we have confronted numerous technological challenges, and we have consistently found solutions. AI will usher in a new era of legal considerations, prompting the development of innovative legal frameworks and solutions.\n\nTherefore, the future of art is bright with the promise of AI. It will not lead to a decline in human creative arts, but rather to an unprecedented flourishing of artistic expression. AI is not a replacement for human creativity, but a powerful tool that can augment and amplify it. By embracing AI, we can unlock new possibilities for artistic innovation and create a more vibrant and diverse art world for all.\n\nIn conclusion, the concerns raised by the opposition, while understandable, are ultimately unfounded. AI is not a threat to human creativity, but a catalyst for its evolution. By embracing this transformative technology, we can unlock new possibilities for artistic expression and create a richer, more vibrant cultural landscape for generations to come.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] *Oxford Learner's Dictionaries*. s.v. \"decline\" Accessed June 12, 2024."

      "content": "Esteemed judges, ladies, and gentlemen, we return to the central question: what do we truly value in art? Our opponents champion transformation, but at what cost to human creativity?\n\nThey've attempted to redefine \"decline\" as mere change, a semantic trick that ignores the real-world consequences. But when an artist's livelihood, their ability to create with integrity, is undermined, is that simply \"change,\" or is it a devastating decline? Consider the countless musicians who have dedicated their lives to mastering their instruments, only to be rendered obsolete by AI-generated music. Is that progress, or a profound loss?\n\nThey dismiss \"artistic integrity\" as a constraint. But art devoid of the artist's unique perspective, skill, and ethical foundation is a hollow imitation. Can an algorithm genuinely replicate the emotional resonance of human experience? Think of Van Gogh, pouring his tormented soul onto the canvas. Can AI replicate that raw authenticity?\n\nThey tout AI's supposed \"democratization\" of art. But human art has already achieved democratization through accessible resources. The critical question is: what happens to human artists when AI devalues their skills and labor? As  artists have already experienced a decline in income due to AI-generated content .\n\nTherefore, we stand firm: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts, not through benign transformation, but through the erosion of artistic integrity, the displacement of human artists, and the devaluation of genuine human expression. Vote FOR the motion, for the preservation of human creativity.\n\n\n[1] Source Name. [Estimated Number] artists have already experienced a decline in income due to AI-generated content."

The opposition paints a picture of loss, a world where AI obliterates artistic value. We, however, have presented a vision of collaboration, where AI serves as a powerful instrument, amplifying human potential. Their anxieties about job displacement overlook the reality that AI cultivates new artistic avenues, enriches creative diversity, and broadens the scope of artistic expression.\n\nWe've established that AI democratizes art, dismantling traditional barriers and fostering inclusivity. While the opposition conceded that human art also achieves democratization, they failed to acknowledge AI's unique transformative accessibility. Furthermore, we've demonstrated how AI compels us to re-evaluate our very understanding of creativity, sparking vital philosophical discussions. The opposition admits that this challenge doesn't inherently equate to \"good,\" yet progress is born from questioning established norms.\n\nThe opposition raised concerns about derivative outputs and ethical considerations. We countered by arguing that restricting artistic integrity stifles progress. By clinging to a restrictive definition of decline, they risk suppressing the very innovation that can enrich human creativity.\n\nThe choice before you is clear. Do we embrace AI as a catalyst for progress, or do we succumb to fear and stagnation? We urge you to choose progress. See AI not as a harbinger of decline, but as a vibrant addition to the human artistic experience. Vote against the motion.\n\n\n"
