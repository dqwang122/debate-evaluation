      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts, which we define as a gradual and continuous loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value in artistic endeavors, including but not limited to visual arts, music, writing, and performance arts, that are conceived and executed primarily by human intellect and skill.\n\nOur judging criteria is artistic integrity, a standard that prioritizes the preservation and promotion of genuine human artistic expression, valuing originality, skill, emotional depth, and ethical creation. We believe that a decline in artistic integrity signifies a decline in human creative arts overall.\n\nFirst, AI diminishes the value and originality of human art. AI art generators are trained on vast datasets of existing artworks, often without the consent or compensation of the original artists. This process leads to derivative outputs that lack true originality and emotional depth . As Elijah Clark notes in Forbes, if we allow AI to proliferate unchecked, we risk a future where art and music styles are \"fixed and static,\" stifling innovation and genuine creative expression . Furthermore, AI-generated art can flood the market, driving down the perceived and monetary value of human-created art. While a study in *Nature* suggests that AI art may enhance perceptions of human creativity when compared, the same study acknowledges that some artists fear it undermines their skills . This \"undermining\" directly impacts the artistic integrity that underpins human creative arts. The commodification of art via AI thus transforms artistic expression into a cheap commodity, devoid of the unique perspective and emotional labor that defines human creativity.\n\nSecond, AI reduces opportunities for human artists and creators. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, music, and writing, businesses and individuals may increasingly opt for cheaper and faster AI-generated content, reducing the demand for human artists . The UNCTAD reports that human creatives have already been replaced in industries ranging from graphics design to game design . Maira Sheikh notes in her LinkedIn article that as AI writing tools become more sophisticated, the demand for human writers begins to shrink . This displacement isn't just about jobs; it's about the ability of artists to sustain themselves and continue developing their craft. If artists cannot make a living from their work, they are less likely to invest the time and effort required to hone their skills and create truly meaningful art. This loss of opportunity directly undermines the preservation and promotion of human artistic expression that defines our judging criteria, leading to an overall decline.\n\nThird, AI raises ethical concerns about copyright and intellectual property. The use of copyrighted material to train AI models raises serious ethical questions about ownership and compensation for artists . Judge William Orrick ruled that Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt were violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems . Illustrators like Karla Ortiz have criticized AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft, citing unauthorized use of their work in AI training as a breach of copyright . The lack of clear legal frameworks for AI-generated art exacerbates these concerns. The ethical implications extend to the very nature of creativity. If AI-generated art relies on unethical practices like copyright infringement, it degrades the integrity of the artistic landscape. Judge Orrick's ruling, as reported by *The Art Newspaper*, highlights the legal battles surrounding AI's use of artists' work . This undermines the ethical creation aspect of our artistic integrity framework,\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "stage": "opening",

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"decline\" as a gradual and continuous loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value in the production, appreciation, innovation, and cultural significance of human-created art forms. We define \"human creative arts\" as artistic endeavors that originate from human ingenuity, skill, and emotional expression, encompassing visual arts, music, literature, performance arts, and crafts. We define \"AI\" as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages; in creative arts, AI refers to algorithms and programs capable of generating art autonomously or assisting human artists.\n\nOur judging criteria is the preservation of human agency in creative expression. You, as the judge, should prioritize arguments that demonstrate the enduring importance of human intellect, emotion, and intention in the creation and appreciation of art. Arguments demonstrating AI's limitations and the unique value of human contribution should be valued higher than arguments solely focused on technological advancement. This standard is appropriate because it centers the debate on the core question of human creativity's fate in the age of AI, rather than simply evaluating AI's capabilities.\n\nFirst, AI lacks the essential qualities of human creativity. AI-generated art lacks the emotional depth, subjective experiences, and intentionality that are fundamental to human artistic expression. Digital Brew  notes that AI art struggles with true emotional depth and the ability to make intuitive decisions. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions, aspects that AI cannot replicate . While AI can mimic creativity, it cannot replace the genuine emotions and unique perspectives that humans bring to their work . This is because AI creativity relies on data and algorithms, lacking true originality and self-expression . The irreplaceable element of human creativity ensures that while AI can generate art, it cannot cause a decline in the unique value and appreciation of human artistic endeavors.\n\nSecond, AI serves as a tool to enhance, not replace, human creativity. AI should be viewed as a tool that assists human artists, enabling them to explore new creative avenues and overcome limitations, rather than as a replacement for human artistic endeavor. Al-Ghamdi  states that AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool that can enrich it if used properly. In fact, most people view AI as an aid to human artists rather than a replacement . AI can assist in generating ideas and overcoming creative blocks . By combining the rapid iteration and image creation strengths of AI with the vision and problem-solving skills of human artists, AI can expand human capabilities and achieve better results . Therefore, rather than leading to a decline, AI serves to augment human creativity, leading to new forms of artistic expression and innovation.\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns impede AI's dominance in the arts. Ethical considerations, such as copyright infringement, lack of consent in training data, and potential job displacement for artists, along with legal ambiguities surrounding AI-generated art, hinder its widespread adoption and prevent the decline of human-led creative arts. Ethical concerns in AI art include copyright issues, lack of consent for training data, and potential job displacement for artists . Copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, leading to legal uncertainty and disputes over ownership and infringement \n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

      "content": "Thank you chairperson esteem judges ladies and gentlemen the opponents opening statement contains several flaws primarily revolving around their redefinition of key terms and their dismissal of the ethical and practical concerns surrounding ai's impact on the arts. We will address their definitional issues and then address each of their rebuttals in turn. First let's address their attempt to redefine decline they claim our definition is too narrow and that decline should encompass the transformation of art forms facilitated by ai. However according to the oxford learner's dictionary decline means a continuous decrease in the number value quality etcetera of something. A transformation that results in fewer opportunities for human artists and a demonstrable loss of originality is a decline. Furthermore their argument that evolution is inherently positive is simply illogical. Evolution can lead to degradation just as easily as it can lead to progress. Therefore their redefinition is unreasonable and does not hold up to scrutiny. Second they challenge our focus on artistic integrity suggesting it's too limiting. Yet what is art without integrity. Novelty alone does not equate to value as bite medic points out in their article the ethical implications of ai on creative professionals. Ai generated art raises concerns about authorship originality and intellectual property. The ethical creation aspect of art is paramount and is undermined by ai's reliance on existing works often without consent or compensation. Now let's address their specific rebuttals. First they accuse us of arguing that all ai art is inherently simple and that we set an unreasonably high standard for emotional depth. This is a straw man. We are not saying all ai art is simple. Our argument supported by elijah clark in forbes is that the process of training ai on vast data sets leads to derivative outputs. The standards of emotional depth apply to both ai and human art. If ai art cannot achieve that depth our argument stands. Second they claimed the art world isn't a fixed p and that ai expands the market however this ignores the displacement of human artists unctad reports that human creatives have already been replaced in industries like graphics design and game design. While ai may generate more content overall as marisch notes in her linkedin article the demand for human artists shrinks. The market is diverted from human artists and given to ai. Human art can also expand the market. The advantage is not unique to ai art. Copyright concerns acquitting them with photography and music sampling this is an equivocation the scale of ai copyright issues is unprecedented. Judge orrick ruled that stability ai midjay and deviantart were violating artists rights. They suggest that current copyright concerns can be solved through licensing. However us judges have declared ai art to be uncopyrightable as seen in blogspot mtu.edu. This isn't just a licensing issue it's a fundamental challenge to the existing legal framework so potential solutions are insufficient fourth they tout ais democratization of art creation but human art has already achieved democratization. Affordable art supplies online tutorials and open source software have made art accessible to a wide audience. Furthermore this democratization comes at the cost of devaluing human skill and labor reducing access to human art. Fifth they argue that a i r challenges are understanding of creativity and authorship. However simply challenging definitions doesn't make something inherently good.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "content": "Thank you chairperson esteemed judges ladies and gentlemen the opponents rebuttal rests on a series of misunderstandings and mischaracterizations of our position. We will address their flaw definition of decline the restrictive view of artistic integrity their inaccurate claims about ai art and their dismissal of the opportunities and benefits ai brings to the creative arts. First regarding their definition of decline they appeal to a dictionary definition. But fail to grasp the dynamic nature of art art is not static it evolves transforms and reinvents itself. What may initially appear as a loss of traditional forms can in fact be the birth of new and exciting avenues of creative expression? To cling to a rigid definition of decline is to ignore the historical trajectory of art itself. Consider photography. Initially derided as a mechanical imitation of painting now celebrated as a distinct and powerful art form similarly ai art may seem disruptive but it is at its core a catalyst for artistic evolution. The focus should be on the end product. The ability to create rather than the creative process. Second the opposition clings to artistic integrity as the sole determinant of value erecting an artificial barrier against innovation. This perspective is excessively narrow and subjective. The pursuit of innovation inherit each challenges established norms and traditions to prioritize integrity above all else is to stifle experimentation and limit the very boundaries of what art can be. Must every piece of art conform to some predefined standard of originality and emotional depth. Great art pushes boundaries challenges conventions and redefines our understanding of beauty and expression. Third they falsely claimed that ai art is inherently simple and derivative. This is a gross oversimplification. Ai algorithms are sophisticated tools capable of generating complex and nuanced works moreover the claim that ai art lacks originality ignores the reality that all art builds upon existing works. Human artists are inspired by their predecessors drawing upon a vast tapestry of influences. Data and then uses that knowledge to generate new outputs often an unexpected and innovative ways 4th they argue that ai art displaces human artists claiming the art world is not a fixed pie. The rise of ai art can expand the entire market by attracting new audiences who may not have previously engaged with art. Tedious tasks allowing them to focus on more creative and fulfilling aspects of their work. Ultimately both ai and human art can coexist and thrive. Fifth concerning copyright the legal landscape is still evolving and the opponent has made factual errors. No definitive rulings have declared all ai art uncopyrightable. Licensing platforms offers a viable solution to address copyright concerns and ensure fair compensation for artists whose works are used in ai training data sets. Sixth regarding the democratization of art we agree that human art is already accessible however ai democratize art in a profoundly different way empowering individuals without traditional skills to express their creative visions. This is not about devaluing human skill it is about expanding the possibilities of artistic expression and fostering a more inclusive and diverse creative landscape.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Filimowicz, Michael. \"The Ten Most Influential Works of AI Art.\" *Medium*, June 4, 2023.\n(2) Manovich, L.

The core of our disagreement lies in the very definition of decline. While the opposition reframes it as mere transformation we must ask. What is the direction of this transformation? Is it one that uplifts and empowers human artists or one that marginalizes and displaces them we maintain that a transformation leading to job losses devalued skills and ethical breaches is undeniably a decline. The oxford learner's dictionary includes a continuous decrease in its definition and that's precisely what we're seeing. It is a logical to assume evolution is always positive. Furthermore our opponents accuse us of creating a straw man by suggesting we believe all ai art is simplistic. We never made such a sweeping claim our argument supported by experts is that ai's training process on fast data sets leads to derivative outputs. The standards of emotional depth should apply to both ai and human art. As elijah clark from forbes warns unchecked ai proliferation risks of future where art styles are fixed and static. Stifling genuine creative expression. Even if the art market expands due to ai as our opponents suggest it doesn't guarantee benefits for human artists the unctad reports human creatives are already being replaced in graphic design and game design.

Challenging us to redefine the boundaries of creativity. Are opponents concerned for artistic integrity is equally narrow.
