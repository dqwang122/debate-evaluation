      "content": "Okay, I have analyzed the provided materials and the proposed framework. The materials are sufficient to support the arguments with some caveats. I will proceed with drafting the opening statement.\n\n```\nIn this debate, we shall argue that genetic enhancement of human embryos should be permitted, which we define as altering the genome of a human embryo to improve traits beyond correcting disease, potentially including physical, cognitive, or other capabilities. \"Permitted\" implies officially allowed or sanctioned by law or ethical guidelines, suggesting a regulatory framework exists to oversee the process.\nOur judging criteria is utilitarianism: the side that maximizes overall well-being and minimizes suffering should win this debate.\n\nFirst, genetic enhancement offers the unprecedented potential to eradicate inherited diseases, leading to a significant reduction in human suffering. Many diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, Huntington's disease, and sickle cell anemia, are caused by genetic mutations passed down through generations. Genetic enhancement, utilizing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, offers the possibility of correcting these mutations in embryos, preventing the disease from ever manifesting. For instance, advanced gene editing techniques could virtually eradicate genetic birth defects, benefiting nearly 8 million children every year . As an editing technology, the CRISPR system can act on mammalian genomes in cell lines, oocytes, and embryos to correct gene mutations and produce offspring with normal gene expression, which is beneficial for treating related diseases . Therefore, by preventing these debilitating conditions, genetic enhancement directly reduces suffering and dramatically improves the quality of life for millions, maximizing overall well-being.\n\nSecond, genetic enhancement can improve human cognitive and physical capabilities, leading to a more productive and innovative society. While controversial, enhancing traits like intelligence, memory, or physical prowess has the potential to lead to advancements in various fields, benefiting society as a whole. Research indicates that the ability to think and learn could be revolutionized by such enhancements . Designer babies, engineered with enhanced capabilities, could be highly resistant to diseases such as cancer . Such enhancements can lead to increased productivity, innovation, and overall societal progress, ultimately maximizing overall well-being.\n\nThird, permitting genetic enhancement fosters scientific progress and medical innovation, leading to advancements in other areas of healthcare. Research into genetic enhancement will inevitably drive the development of new technologies and techniques that can be applied to other medical fields. For example, the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology, initially explored for gene editing, has already revolutionized gene therapy and disease modeling . As a result of understanding that the human genome can be edited by CRISPR-Cas9, it became clear that genome editing could also be used for therapeutic purposes, and a new era in genetic engineering began . This fosters a culture of innovation and ultimately improves healthcare for all.\n\nIn conclusion, by eradicating inherited diseases, enhancing human capabilities, and fostering scientific progress, permitting genetic enhancement of human embryos maximizes overall well-being and minimizes suffering. We therefore strongly affirm the motion.\n\n**Reference**\n(1)  Ma H, Marti-Gutierrez N, Park I-H, et al. (2015).

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that genetic enhancement of human embryos should *not* be permitted. We define **genetic enhancement** as altering the genetic makeup of a human embryo with the intention of improving traits beyond normal health, function, or appearance, going beyond treating or preventing disease, aiming for enhancements like increased intelligence or athletic ability. **Permitted** means officially allowed or authorized; not forbidden by law or regulation.\n\nOur judging criteria is based on **Utilitarianism**: The permissibility of genetic enhancement should be judged based on whether it maximizes overall well-being and minimizes harm to society as a whole, considering both present and future generations. We will demonstrate that the potential harms of genetic enhancement significantly outweigh any potential benefits.\n\nFirst, the *unintended consequences and off-target effects* of genetic modification technologies pose significant risks. While CRISPR technology shows promise, it is not without flaws. Studies show that CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing can lead to unintended mutations at the targeted section of DNA in early human embryos . These off-target mutations and unintended genetic changes could have unpredictable and potentially harmful consequences for the individual and, critically, for future generations . Given that CRISPR is highly efficient in the cells of human embryos , the risk of unintended mutations remains a grave concern. The long-term health implications of these unintended modifications are unknown, and some could be devastating. Thus, until we have a complete understanding of the tech, we can not move forward with it.\n\nSecond, permitting genetic enhancement will inevitably *exacerbate social inequality*. If genetic enhancement becomes available, it is highly likely to be accessible only to the wealthy . Molecular biologist Lee Silver fears that disparate access to genetic technologies will drive a wedge between enhanced and un-enhanced classes of people . The cost of these technologies will create a genetically enhanced upper class, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor and creating a more unjust and unequal society . If misused, gene editing could make social inequalities worse . This division will cause unrest and instability.\n\nThird, genetic enhancement will lead to the *erosion of human dignity and devaluation of non-enhanced individuals*. The pursuit of genetic enhancement could lead to a societal devaluation of individuals who are not genetically modified, fostering discrimination and undermining the inherent dignity and worth of all human beings. The main societal risk is seen in the possible misuse of GGE for non-medically indicated purposes such as genetic enhancement . Genetic enhancement can cause anxiety, depression, and identity issues . Ethical concerns include the potential loss of natural traits and unforeseen consequences. Gene-editing alters the physical body. Due to the integrated mind-body relationship, it can also directly and indirectly modify mental identity .\n\nIn conclusion, permitting genetic enhancement of human embryos presents unacceptable risks. The potential for unintended consequences, the certainty of increased social inequality, and the likely erosion of human dignity outweigh any speculative benefits. Therefore, we strongly urge you to reject the proposition.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Researchers call for greater awareness of unintended consequences of CRISPR gene-editing.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the negative\u2019s opening statement contains three critical flaws: their mischaracterization of our definition, their unnecessary rejection of the utilitarian framework, and their unsubstantiated fears regarding potential harms.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims our definition of genetic enhancement as \"optimizing potential\" is overly simplistic. However, this is a straw man. We are not suggesting a purely subjective notion of enhancement. Like all medical interventions designed to improve upon a natural state, we refer to optimizing objectively measurable aspects of human well-being, such as resistance to disease and cognitive function within a healthy range . This approach aligns with established scientific consensus  and ethical guidelines, and it is unreasonable to suggest that seeking to improve health is inherently dangerous simply because the definition of \"health\" contains subjective elements. The core of medicine involves improvement and optimization.\n\nSecond, they unnecessarily reject the utilitarian framework, proposing equity, ethics, and feasibility as alternative criteria. We contend that these are not alternatives at all, but integral components of a sound utilitarian analysis. A system riddled with inequity, ethical violations, or infeasible elements cannot maximize overall well-being . By focusing on well-being and minimizing harm to all, permitting genetic enhancement will result in the best possible solution for a variety of socioeconomic problems . So, in the end, it still promotes the affirmative side\u2019s case for utilitarianism.\n\nThird, the opposition raises the specter of a \"genetic divide,\" suggesting that access to genetic enhancement will be limited to the wealthy. However, this argument ignores existing inequalities in healthcare, education, and other essential resources . History shows that technologies, initially expensive, become more accessible over time, like in-vitro fertilization and personal computers. Furthermore, preventing genetic enhancement could itself create an unacceptable inequality, condemning some to preventable genetic diseases while others are spared. .\n\nFourth, the specter of eugenics. The proposed genetic enhancement, operating under stringent regulations and ethical oversight, stands distinctly apart from the coercive, state-sponsored eugenics of the past . We champion individual choice within an ethically sound framework. Moreover, carefully regulated genetic enhancement can, in fact, empower individuals by mitigating genetic predispositions to disabilities . The ethical considerations include benefits from the therapy, prevent suffering, reproductive freedom in genetic choices, and improve normal functions .\n\nFinally, regarding regulation and unintended consequences, we acknowledge the inherent risks in any new technology. However, like driving a car, we manage these risks with regulations and safety measures, rather than outright prohibition . The significant potential benefits of genetic enhancement\u2014disease eradication and cognitive enhancement\u2014warrant taking calculated risks, particularly with appropriate oversight. We can draw on expertise in genetics and bioethics to ensure safe regulation, and use predictive modeling to evaluate potential risks .\n\nTherefore, we reaffirm our stance: genetic enhancement of human embryos should be permitted, guided by ethical considerations and robust regulatory oversight, to maximize well-being and minimize suffering for all.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Rubeis, Giovanni, and Florian Steger. \u201cRisks and Benefits of Human Germline Genome Editing: An Ethical Analysis.\u201d *Asian Bioeth Rev* 10, no. 2 (2018): 133\u201341.\n(2) Almeida, Mara, and Rui Diogo. \u201cHuman Enhancement: Genetic Engineering and Evolution.\u201d *Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health* 2019, no. 1 (2019): 169\u201377.\n(3) Rothschild, Jodie. 2020. \u201cEthical Considerations of Gene Editing and Genetic Selection.\u201d *Journal of General and Family Medicine* 21 (3): 37\u201347.\n(4) The National Academies 2017\n(5) Public opinion is divided on the widespread use of gene editing, with concerns about increasing the gap between higher- and lower-income Americans.

      "content": "Thank you chairperson is steam a judges ladies and gentlemen. The opponent attempts to paint a rosy picture of genetic enhancement. But their arguments are riddled with flaws. We will demonstrate why their utilitarian approach is not only insufficient but also dangerous and why they're proposed solutions are unrealistic and potentially harmful. First they claim our definition of optimizing potential is overly subjective. Yet they fail to provide a clear objective alternative. The reality is that any definition of enhancement is inherently subjective reflecting the values and biases of those making the decision. Are we to believe that a government committee can objectively define what constitutes an optimal human being. This opens the door to ethically problematic applications such as prioritizing certain traits over others based on societal prejudices. We must ask whose definition of better are we using and what are the potential consequences of imposing that definition on future generations. Second they advocate for a utilitarian framework. Claiming it will maximize well-being. However this approach ignores the fundamental issue of equity. Even if genetic enhancement could theoretically increase overall well-being it is unlikely to benefit everyone equally. As lee silver notes disparate access to genetic technologies will drive a wedge between enhanced and unenhanced classes of people. Their utilitarian calculus fails to account for the very real possibility of exacerbating existing inequalities creating a society where the rich get richer and the poor get genetically left behind. How can we speak of maximizing well-being when such a significant portion of the population is excluded from the benefits? Utilitarian approach ignores the inherent value and dignity of each individual regardless of their genetic makeup. Third they propose subsidies and public programs to address the genetic divided drawing an analogy to public education. However this analogy is flawed. While we strive for equal educational opportunities disparities persist due to factors such as socioeconomic status and geographic location. Consider that in the us in 2021 the top 20% of earners received 50% of all income. Can subsidies and public programs truly level the playing field when such disparities exists moreover their proposed funding mechanism attacks on genetic enhancement is inherently regressive. It creates a system where only the wealthy can afford genetic enhancement which in turn leads to a society that continues the genetic divided. The wealthy can pay for the enhancement and the associated tax while the less wealthy would be unable to afford it to begin with. Fourth they dismiss our concerns about eugenics claiming that strict ethical guidelines and legal safeguards can prevent misuse. However history is replete with examples of eugenic movements that despite good intentions resulted in discrimination and social stratification. The pursuit of genetic perfection however well-intentioned carries an inherent risk of devaluing those who do not meet the ideal standard. It is not enough to simply say that this time will be different. We must learn from the mistakes of the past and recognized the potential for even seemingly benign genetic enhancements to contribute to a culture of intolerance and discrimination. As bioethicist henry greeley notes embryo selection alone can accomplish almost anything genetic modification can.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Virolainen, Samuel J, Andrew VonHandorf, Kenyatta C M F Viel, Matthew T Weirauch, and Lisa M Benson. 2022. \u201cGene\u2013Environment Interactions and Their Impact on Human Health.\u201d *Genes and Immunity* 24 (1): 1\u201311.\n(2) Rothschild, Jodie. 2020. \u201cEthical Considerations of Gene Editing and Genetic Selection.\u201d *Journal of General and Family Medicine* 21 (3): 37\u201347.\n(3) Present). \u201cEugenics: Its Origin and Development (1883.\u201d *Inquiries into Human Fertility and Its Development* (1883).\n(4) Caplan, Arthur L, Brendan Parent, Michael Shen, and Carolyn Plunkett. 2015. \u201cNo Time to Waste\u2014the Ethical Challenges Created by CRISPR.\u201d *EMBO Reports* 16 (11): 1421\u201326.\n(5) Rubeis, Giovanni, and Florian Steger. \u201cRisks and Benefits of Human Germline Genome Editing: An Ethical Analysis.\u201d *Asian Bioeth Rev* 10, no. 2 (2018): 133\u201341.\n(6) Almeida, Mara, and Rui Diogo. \u201cHuman Enhancement: Genetic Engineering and Evolution.\u201d *Evolution, Medicine, and Public Health* 2019, no. 1 (2019): 169\u201377.\n(7) Greely, Henry.

And the potential societal impacts of genetic enhancement. Our opponents argue that the subjectivity of enhancement makes universally accepted standards impossible. However we contend that widely accepted and effectively enforced standards are achievable like existing regulations in medicine and environmental protection we can develop ethical guidelines through open discussion and expert consensus. Complete agreement isn't necessary for effective regulation. Furthermore while our opponents claim a utilitarian framework is inadequate. We maintained at maximizing overall well-being includes addressing equity concerns. Unequal access to enhancement would reduce overall well-being our opponents demand a standard of zero risk an impossible goal. Instead our focus is on minimizing risk and maximizing benefits. The potential to eradicate inherited diseases is a compelling example. Through clinical trials an ongoing monitoring we can detect and mitigate unintended consequences. To counter concerns about a genetic divided we propose concrete solutions. A dedicated tax on genetic enhancement procedures similar to taxes on tobacco could fund equitable access this helps mitigate inequality as seen with pell grants in education. We acknowledge the eugenics risk but strict ethical guidelines public education and legal safeguards can prevent its promotion.

Ethical concerns of genetic engineering of human embryos is high and the main societal risk is seen in the possible misuse of GGE for non-medically indicated purposes such as genetic enhancement .\n\nEven with advancements in genomics, eliminating unintended harm from gene interactions is impossible, even with advancements, and raises ethical questions about permanently altering the human species.
