      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand before you today to affirm the resolution: If healthcare is a scarce resource, government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.  We recognize the gravity of this topic and the inherent ethical complexities it presents.  Therefore, we define \u201cscarce resource\u201d as demonstrably insufficient healthcare resources to meet all needs.  Our judging criteria for this debate will be maximizing overall societal benefit and long-term health outcomes. This criteria is reasonable because when resources are limited, we must prioritize actions that benefit the most people and ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system for future generations.\n\nLet me turn to our first argument: government-led rationing allows for the prioritization of preventative care and public health initiatives, maximizing long-term health outcomes.  Consider this: the CDC emphasizes that preventative care, such as regular checkups and understanding your family history, helps prevent chronic diseases and lessens the severity of infectious diseases [1].  As you'll see, this is crucial because studies show four out of five leading causes of death are preventable or manageable with regular healthcare access [4]. Government rationing, while seemingly restrictive, can ensure these preventative services are prioritized when resources are scarce. By strategically redirecting resources towards preventative care, the government can mitigate the long-term health and economic burdens of chronic diseases, potentially saving more lives in the long run.\n\nThis brings me to our second point: rationing frees up resources for research and development of new treatments and technologies, addressing the root causes of scarcity. The scarcity of healthcare resources necessitates difficult choices. Rationing, while ethically complex, offers a mechanism for maximizing the impact of limited resources. Research indicates that by prioritizing high-impact treatments and restricting access to marginally beneficial interventions, we can free up resources [2].  Imagine if these freed-up resources could be strategically directed towards research and development, fueling the creation of new treatments and technologies. Studies show that rationing can stimulate innovation by creating a demand for more cost-effective and efficient healthcare solutions [2, 3, 5]. This proactive approach not only improves patient care but also contributes to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.\n\nThe crucial issue here is societal resilience, which is our third argument. Government-led rationing promotes societal resilience in the face of future health crises by establishing clear protocols for resource allocation.  History demonstrates that government-led rationing during crises, such as World War II rationing in the UK and the US, ensured equitable resource distribution and societal stability [6, 7, 8].  These programs, while not without challenges, successfully allocated scarce goods, preventing hoarding and chaos. This historical precedent strongly supports the government's role in establishing protocols for healthcare allocation in future health crises, thereby fostering societal resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that in situations of scarcity, government intervention through rationing becomes necessary, not to decide whose life is *not* worth saving, but to ensure the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of people.  By prioritizing preventative care, investing in research and development, and establishing protocols for future crises, government-led rationing offers a strategic and ultimately life-saving approach to managing scarce healthcare resources.  We urge you to affirm the resolution.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Instead, we should seek alternatives that uphold individual autonomy, promote efficiency, and ensure equitable access without compromising the quality of care.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n- **Health Care:** Medical services provided to individuals to maintain or improve their health.\n- **Scarce Resource:** A resource in limited supply relative to its demand.\n- **Government Rationing:** Government-imposed allocation of limited resources, determining who receives certain services and who does not.\n\n**Judging Criteria:**\n\nThe debate should be assessed based on the principles of individual autonomy, equity, and the effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The side that best demonstrates how to manage scarce resources while upholding these principles should prevail.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n1. **Erosion of Individual Autonomy:**\n\n   Government rationing of healthcare infringes upon personal autonomy by allowing the state to make life-and-death decisions for individuals. This centralization of power can lead to a loss of personal freedom in making healthcare choices.\n\n   *According to an article from the Heritage Foundation, increased government control leads to patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions .* This undermines the patient-doctor relationship and can erode trust in the healthcare system.\n\n2. **Inequitable Access and Discrimination:**\n\n   Government rationing can inadvertently lead to discrimination and unequal treatment of certain populations. Decisions about who receives care may be influenced by biases, leading to disparities.\n\n   *A study published in the \"Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health\" highlights that rationing can disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, exacerbating existing health disparities .* This is contrary to the ethical principle of justice, which demands fair treatment for all individuals.\n\n3. **Negative Impact on Quality and Innovation:**\n\n   Rationing often results in reduced incentives for healthcare providers to innovate or improve services. It can lead to longer wait times and decreased quality of care.\n\n   *Data from the United States shows that private sector involvement in healthcare leads to better efficiency and innovation compared to government-run systems .* When providers compete, they are motivated to offer higher quality services to attract patients.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions Exist:**\n\n   Instead of resorting to rationing, we should explore solutions that increase efficiency and reduce waste within the healthcare system. Empowering private enterprise, encouraging competition, and promoting personal responsibility can help address scarcity without imposing oppressive controls.\n\n   *An article from \"Economics Help.org\" argues that private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition and profit motives driving improvements in quality and reduction of costs .*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, while healthcare scarcity is a pressing issue, government rationing is not the answer. It infringes on personal autonomy, risks unequal treatment, and stifles innovation. We should focus on enhancing efficiency, fostering competition, and respecting individual choices to create a more effective and equitable healthcare system. Let us seek solutions that uphold the dignity and freedom of every individual rather than allowing the government to decide whose life is worth saving.\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

      "content": "My opponents raise concerns about government rationing infringing upon personal autonomy. They argue that government involvement leads to a loss of personal freedom in healthcare choices. However, this argument misconstrues the role of government in healthcare.  The government's role can be to empower individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability, facilitating greater autonomy in healthcare decisions.  Think about it \u2013 increased access, due to government investment, can make more individuals active participants in their healthcare, not passive recipients as our opponents suggest, citing the Heritage Foundation. In fact, their argument overlooks how a well-designed rationing system can actually enhance individual freedom by expanding access to critical services, directly contradicting their claim.\n\nThey also claim that government rationing can lead to inequitable access and discrimination. While we acknowledge the potential for bias, examples of successful, transparent systems challenge this notion.  Consider road space rationing, where transparent criteria and public acceptance work together effectively [1].  Moreover, established priority protocols in resource allocation demonstrate the government's ability to prevent discrimination and ensure accountability [2].  These examples highlight that successful implementation relies on fairness, transparency, and accountability, elements achievable through proper governance, thereby mitigating the risk of inequity.\n\nFurthermore, our opponents argue that rationing negatively impacts quality and innovation.  This simply isn\u2019t true. Rationing, by its very nature, necessitates the efficient allocation of scarce resources, which can actually drive innovation in cost-effective treatments and care delivery. Research even supports this, demonstrating that resource scarcity encourages the development of innovative solutions [3, 4]. This directly contradicts our opponents' claim, showing that rationing can be a catalyst for, rather than an impediment to, innovation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address a crucial point they overlooked: the risk of discriminatory practices by private entities in allocating scarce resources.  Government oversight is key here.  It promotes equitable resource allocation by establishing transparent criteria and accountability mechanisms.  The \"Toolkit for Considering Equity When Conducting Oversight Work\" emphasizes the government's role in ensuring accountability in resource use, minimizing the potential for discriminatory practices by private entities [5].  Furthermore, government agencies can direct resources to communities based on need through established guidelines [6], further reducing the likelihood of biased allocation by private actors.\n\nFinally, our opponents suggest alternative solutions, focusing on efficiency and competition.  While these are important, they fail to address the immediate need for resource allocation in a scarcity scenario. A structured rationing system, however, facilitates data collection and analysis, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of allocation criteria [7].  This data-driven approach allows for easier identification of trends, resource allocation gaps, and areas for improvement, thereby promoting a more equitable and effective system. In contrast, their proposed solutions lack this structured approach to data analysis and system improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, while our opponents raise valid concerns, their arguments fail to consider the potential benefits and safeguards of a well-implemented government rationing system.  Our approach prioritizes not only individual liberties but also equitable access, innovation, and continuous improvement in resource allocation, ensuring the best possible outcomes in a situation of scarcity.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] FasterCapital.

      "content": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI have attentively considered my opponent's arguments advocating for government rationing of healthcare resources. While their intentions to ensure equitable access and enhance autonomy are commendable, their perspective overlooks fundamental issues inherent in such government intervention.\n\nFirstly, my opponent contends that government rationing empowers individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability. However, this view fails to acknowledge that increased government control often leads to diminished personal autonomy. As noted in an article by the Heritage Foundation, government-controlled healthcare can result in patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions. Centralizing decision-making with government officials strips individuals and their doctors of the ability to make personalized choices, replacing them with one-size-fits-all policies that cannot cater to the unique needs of each patient.\n\nMoreover, the assertion that government involvement enhances access ignores the inefficiencies typically associated with bureaucratic systems. Countries with government-run healthcare often experience longer wait times and delays in receiving care. According to \"Economics Help.org,\" increased government control can lead to decreased efficiency and reduced quality of care due to lack of competition and profit motive. This undermines the very autonomy and timely access my opponent suggests will be improved.\n\nSecondly, my opponent draws parallels between healthcare rationing and road space rationing, citing it as an example of successful government intervention. This comparison is flawed. Managing traffic congestion is vastly different from making life-and-death healthcare decisions. Healthcare involves complex, deeply personal choices that cannot be effectively governed by broad, generalized protocols without sacrificing individual needs and ethical considerations.\n\nWhile my opponent argues that government rationing can prevent discrimination through established priority protocols, history demonstrates that government systems are not immune to bias and inequality. Bureaucratic decision-making can inadvertently perpetuate systemic disparities. Vulnerable populations may continue to face barriers within a government-controlled system, and the lack of accountability can make it difficult to address these injustices.\n\nThirdly, the claim that rationing spurs innovation by necessitating efficient resource allocation overlooks the reality that innovation thrives in competitive environments. Government rationing can stifle innovation by imposing funding limitations and removing incentives for private entities to invest in research and development. The private sector, driven by competition and the pursuit of excellence, is more likely to produce innovative solutions that improve care and reduce costs.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent warns of discriminatory practices by private entities and suggests that government oversight is the remedy. However, excessive government intervention can lead to increased bureaucracy and red tape, hindering the responsiveness and adaptability of the healthcare system. Proper regulation, rather than outright control, can mitigate risks without compromising efficiency and patient-centered care.\n\nLastly, my opponent critiques market-based solutions for not addressing immediate scarcity. Yet, evidence indicates that enhancing efficiency and fostering competition can effectively manage resources. As highlighted by \"Economics Help.org,\" private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition driving improvements in quality and cost reduction\n\n**Reference**\n1.

Preventive health care involves taking steps to prevent illnesses or detect health issues early on when they are more manageable. This approach shifts the focus from merely treating existing conditions to actively working towards maintaining optimal health. Preventive care is key for promoting well-being, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs by addressing health issues before they become more serious or costly.

Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

It is covered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and helps keeps health care costs low. Learn more about what counts as preventive care and how this affects your health care and insurance costs. Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater equity. A number of countries have attempted to depoliticize decisions on rationing by using health technology assessments and dedicated agencies. Discussion: Resource allocation and rationing differ considerably between the US and Europe. In the US, where social welfare remains controversial, there are few restrictions on the use of health care technology regardless of cost or clinical effectiveness. European countries engage in more explicit debates about these limits, though these are complicated by media and lobby power. 1 Chief Science Officer, Los",

Studies like \"Rationing of Health Care\" (6_1) demonstrate that healthcare rationing is primarily driven by the scarcity of resources alongside escalating costs and demands. This scarcity forces difficult choices, and rationing provides a framework for these choices. By prioritizing essential care and procedures with demonstrably high success rates, rationing reduces expenditure on less effective treatments. This, in turn, makes available previously tied-up resources for other crucial areas. Specifically, these freed-up resources can be channeled towards research and development of innovative treatments and technologies. This reinvestment can accelerate progress towards solutions that directly address the underlying reasons behind resource scarcity.  While ethical considerations surrounding rationing are important, the economic reality necessitates strategies that maximize the impact of available resources. This reinvestment not only generates future cost savings through the development of more efficient technologies, but also advances medical care by improving treatment options and addressing root causes of existing diseases.  Opponents might argue that rationing restricts patient access to potentially beneficial treatments. However, without a sustainable model based on responsible resource allocation, the healthcare system's long-term viability, and its ability to provide any care at all, may become jeopardized. In other words, targeted investment in research and development enabled by strategic rationing offers the highest likelihood of addressing the causes of scarcity and, ultimately, improving healthcare for all.",

From a historical perspective, wartime rationing has played a vital role in sustaining nations during periods of conflict. It first gained prominence during World War I when countries faced severe shortages of food, fuel, and other essential commodities. Rationing systems were implemented to distribute these limited resources fairly among the population. This approach not only prevented hoarding and price gouging but also ensured that soldiers and civilians alike had access to basic necessities.

Like most Americans during World War II, Oklahomans submitted to a comprehensive system of rationing. Because the United States had experienced wartime inflation during World War I, the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply was established in April 1941 to prevent inflation during World War II. However, the organization had little authority. Consequently, in August 1941 Congress reorganized the agency and changed its name to the Office of Price Administration (OPA). The Emergency Price Control Act of January 1942 increased OPA's powers and authorized it to set ceiling prices on commodities. OPA regulated according to directives from other government agencies such as the War Production Board, War Food Administration, and Petroleum Administration for War. Despite regulation, prices rose, and OPA began rationing scarce consumer goods under the Second War Powers Act (1942). Commodities were allocated first to the armed services and U.S. allies. Civilian allocations were determined once agencies certified amounts available for rationing. OPA administrators Leon Henderson (1941\u201342), Prentiss Brown (1943), and Chester Bowles (1943\u201346) devised the rationing program to equally distribute civilian allocations. OPA employed sixty thousand persons but relied primarily on two hundred thousand volunteers. Rationing was administered on four levels: the national office in Washington, D.C., where policy was formulated and regulations written, nine regional offices (Oklahoma fell within region eight headquartered in Dallas, Texas), approximately ninety-three district offices, and over fifty-six hundred local War Price and Rationing Board offices located in counties throughout the country. Known as local boards, they linked OPA with consumers. Oklahoma County's three original board members were V. P. Crowe, R. J. Clements, and Fred Bailey. OPA developed four methods for rationing, and ration currency included stamps, coupons, toke",

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in e",

This is crucial because four out of five leading causes of death are preventable or manageable with regular healthcare access (5_36).  Government rationing, while seemingly restrictive, can ensure these preventative services are prioritized when resources are scarce. By shifting resources towards preventative care, the government can mitigate the long-term health and economic burdens of chronic diseases, potentially saving more lives in the long run.  While critics may argue that government rationing interferes with individual healthcare choices, the reality is that a scarce resource requires allocation based on what maximizes overall societal benefit, and preventative care is demonstrably cost-effective and impactful. A well-designed rationing system, prioritizing prevention, doesn't restrict care, it redirects it strategically to achieve the best possible population health outcomes with the available resources.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Rationing frees up resources for research and development of new treatments and technologies, addressing the root causes of scarcity.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_0', 'query': 'How does rationing medical resources impact research and development spending?', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF03391667.pdf'}, {'id': '6_1', 'query': 'How does rationing medical resources impact research and development spending?', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://emergingtrends.stanford.edu/files/original/848b1d77c01bef9accadec654294a454954a77c7.pdf'}, {'id': '6_3', 'query': 'How does rationing medical resources impact research and development spending?', 'title': 'Rationing in healthcare\u2014a scoping review - PMC - PubMed Central (PMC)', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10319992/'}, {'id': '6_5', 'query': 'Does rationing healthcare free up resources for other areas like research?', 'title': 'Resource allocation and rationing in nursing care: A discussion paper', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6681425/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The scarcity of healthcare resources necessitates difficult choices. Rationing, while ethically complex, offers a mechanism for maximizing the impact of limited resources. By prioritizing high-impact treatments and restricting access to marginally beneficial interventions, as discussed in \"Rationing of Health Care\" (6_1), we can free up resources.  These resources can then be strategically directed towards research and development. This investment in R&D fuels the creation of new treatments and technologies, addressing the underlying causes of scarcity. Furthermore, as explored in several studies (6_0, 6_3, 6_5), rationing can stimulate innovation by creating a demand for more cost-effective and efficient healthcare solutions.  This proactive approach not only improves patient care but also contributes to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Government-led rationing promotes societal resilience in the face of future health crises by establishing clear protocols for resource allocation.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '9_0', 'query': 'Historical examples of successful government rationing programs during crises', 'title': 'Wartime rationing: Lessons from History - FasterCapital', 'url': 'https://fastercapital.com/content/Wartime-rationing--Lessons-from-History.html'}, {'id': '9_1', 'query': 'Historical examples of successful government rationing programs during crises', 'title': 'Wartime rationing: Lessons from History update - FasterCapital', 'url': 'https://fastercapital.com/content/Wartime-rationing--Lessons-from-History-update.html'}, {'id': '9_2', 'query': 'Historical examples of successful government rationing programs during crises', 'title': 'Rationing: Definition, Purposes, and Historical Example - Investopedia', 'url': 'https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rationing.asp'}]\n**Short Argument**: History demonstrates that government-led rationing during crises, such as World War II rationing in the UK and the US, ensured equitable resource distribution and societal stability.  These programs, while not without challenges, successfully allocated scarce goods, preventing hoarding and chaos. This historical precedent strongly supports government's role in establishing protocols for healthcare allocation in future health crises, thereby fostering societal resilience.\n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand before you today to affirm the resolution: If healthcare is a scarce resource, government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.  We recognize the gravity of this topic and the inherent ethical complexities it presents.  Therefore, we define \u201cscarce resource\u201d as demonstrably insufficient healthcare resources to meet all needs.  Our judging criteria for this debate will be maximizing overall societal benefit and long-term health outcomes. This criteria is reasonable because when resources are limited, we must prioritize actions that benefit the most people and ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system for future generations.\n\nLet me turn to our first argument: government-led rationing allows for the prioritization of preventative care and public health initiatives, maximizing long-term health outcomes.  Consider this: the CDC emphasizes that preventative care, such as regular checkups and understanding your family history, helps prevent chronic diseases and lessens the severity of infectious diseases [1].  As you'll see, this is crucial because studies show four out of five leading causes of death are preventable or manageable with regular healthcare access [4]. Government rationing, while seemingly restrictive, can ensure these preventative services are prioritized when resources are scarce. By strategically redirecting resources towards preventative care, the government can mitigate the long-term health and economic burdens of chronic diseases, potentially saving more lives in the long run.\n\nThis brings me to our second point: rationing frees up resources for research and development of new treatments and technologies, addressing the root causes of scarcity. The scarcity of healthcare resources necessitates difficult choices. Rationing, while ethically complex, offers a mechanism for maximizing the impact of limited resources. Research indicates that by prioritizing high-impact treatments and restricting access to marginally beneficial interventions, we can free up resources [2].  Imagine if these freed-up resources could be strategically directed towards research and development, fueling the creation of new treatments and technologies. Studies show that rationing can stimulate innovation by creating a demand for more cost-effective and efficient healthcare solutions [2, 3, 5]. This proactive approach not only improves patient care but also contributes to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.\n\nThe crucial issue here is societal resilience, which is our third argument. Government-led rationing promotes societal resilience in the face of future health crises by establishing clear protocols for resource allocation.  History demonstrates that government-led rationing during crises, such as World War II rationing in the UK and the US, ensured equitable resource distribution and societal stability [6, 7, 8].  These programs, while not without challenges, successfully allocated scarce goods, preventing hoarding and chaos. This historical precedent strongly supports the government's role in establishing protocols for healthcare allocation in future health crises, thereby fostering societal resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that in situations of scarcity, government intervention through rationing becomes necessary, not to decide whose life is *not* worth saving, but to ensure the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of people.  By prioritizing preventative care, investing in research and development, and establishing protocols for future crises, government-led rationing offers a strategic and ultimately life-saving approach to managing scarce healthcare resources.  We urge you to affirm the resolution.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Instead, we should seek alternatives that uphold individual autonomy, promote efficiency, and ensure equitable access without compromising the quality of care.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n- **Health Care:** Medical services provided to individuals to maintain or improve their health.\n- **Scarce Resource:** A resource in limited supply relative to its demand.\n- **Government Rationing:** Government-imposed allocation of limited resources, determining who receives certain services and who does not.\n\n**Judging Criteria:**\n\nThe debate should be assessed based on the principles of individual autonomy, equity, and the effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The side that best demonstrates how to manage scarce resources while upholding these principles should prevail.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n1. **Erosion of Individual Autonomy:**\n\n   Government rationing of healthcare infringes upon personal autonomy by allowing the state to make life-and-death decisions for individuals. This centralization of power can lead to a loss of personal freedom in making healthcare choices.\n\n   *According to an article from the Heritage Foundation, increased government control leads to patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions .* This undermines the patient-doctor relationship and can erode trust in the healthcare system.\n\n2. **Inequitable Access and Discrimination:**\n\n   Government rationing can inadvertently lead to discrimination and unequal treatment of certain populations. Decisions about who receives care may be influenced by biases, leading to disparities.\n\n   *A study published in the \"Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health\" highlights that rationing can disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, exacerbating existing health disparities .* This is contrary to the ethical principle of justice, which demands fair treatment for all individuals.\n\n3. **Negative Impact on Quality and Innovation:**\n\n   Rationing often results in reduced incentives for healthcare providers to innovate or improve services. It can lead to longer wait times and decreased quality of care.\n\n   *Data from the United States shows that private sector involvement in healthcare leads to better efficiency and innovation compared to government-run systems .* When providers compete, they are motivated to offer higher quality services to attract patients.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions Exist:**\n\n   Instead of resorting to rationing, we should explore solutions that increase efficiency and reduce waste within the healthcare system. Empowering private enterprise, encouraging competition, and promoting personal responsibility can help address scarcity without imposing oppressive controls.\n\n   *An article from \"Economics Help.org\" argues that private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition and profit motives driving improvements in quality and reduction of costs .*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, while healthcare scarcity is a pressing issue, government rationing is not the answer. It infringes on personal autonomy, risks unequal treatment, and stifles innovation. We should focus on enhancing efficiency, fostering competition, and respecting individual choices to create a more effective and equitable healthcare system. Let us seek solutions that uphold the dignity and freedom of every individual rather than allowing the government to decide whose life is worth saving.\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

The evidence provided, an article from the Heritage Foundation, lacks sufficient detail to substantiate the claim that government involvement makes patients passive recipients and erodes trust. Furthermore, the claim focuses solely on the potential negative impact on individual liberties while ignoring the crucial ways government improves healthcare autonomy.  The \"Essay: National Government, Crisis, and Civil Liberties\" from the Bill of Rights Institute highlights the balance between liberty and national security.  Similarly, government involvement in healthcare can focus on ensuring quality and access without impinging on individual autonomy in decision-making. The \"Classical Liberalism\" article underscores the importance of individual freedom, which a well-designed healthcare system can promote by enabling informed choices through better access and information. Government rationing, while necessitating some limitations, doesn't automatically strip individuals of their right to choose their treatments in consultation with medical professionals.

Federal agencies, guided by the Office of Management and Budget are now busy implementing the executive order which includes conducting agency-wide equity assessments and developing plans to address equity barriers. Based on Third Sector's experience providing technical assistance, training, coaching, and thought partnership to over 50 state and county-level government agencies working to improve outcomes for historically marginalized and excluded populations, we offer a framework, for how federal (as well as state and local agencies) can assess and reorient their systems to achieve improved and equitable outcomes. This framework involves two guiding principles and six \"building blocks\" that collectively determine how opportunities and benefits reach people. Achieving an equitable distribution of opportunities and benefits means embracing the principles while taking concrete action within each building block. The guiding principles include acknowledging past harm and centering end-users. The building blocks include internal culture, external relationships, data, services & technical assistance, policy, and funding.

Ethical Considerations Resource rationing is a critical and often contentious issue, particularly in the context of healthcare, where resources can be scarce and the demand often exceeds supply. The ethical considerations surrounding resource rationing are complex and multifaceted, involving a delicate balance between efficiency, equity, and respect for individual rights. Different ethical frameworks offer varying insights into how resources should be allocated, and these perspectives can sometimes conflict, making the decision-making process even more challenging. From a utilitarian perspective, the focus is on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, which may lead to prioritizing those who could gain the most benefit from the resources. For example, during a pandemic, vaccines might be rationed first to healthcare workers and vulnerable populations, as they are at higher risk and their well-being is crucial to society's functioning. In contrast, a deontological approach would emphasize the importance of equal respect and dignity for all individuals, suggesting that resources should be distributed without regard to the potential outcomes. This might mean allocating resources on a first-come, first-served basis, or through a lottery system, to ensure that no individual is favored over anoth",

Specifically, restricting vehicles based on license plate numbers offers a clear, objective criterion understood and accepted by the public. Mexico City's \\\"Hoy No Circula\\\" program demonstrates a real-world implementation of such a system. Conversely, \\\"Rationing: Rationing Resources\\\" (1_6) examines Venezuela's rationing system, which lacked transparency and faced public backlash, underscoring that good governance is essential for equitable outcomes.

The study \"Rationing in healthcare\u2014a scoping review\" (6_30, 6_31), which examined seven articles on healthcare rationing, reveals that resource scarcity, the core driver of rationing, actually fosters innovation. The review shows that when resources are limited, healthcare systems are compelled to find more efficient and effective ways to deliver care, leading to the development of novel treatment methods and care delivery models.  This directly contradicts the presented claim, demonstrating how rationing can create an environment conducive to innovation.  Moreover, the opponent's claim relies on a simplistic comparison between private and government-run healthcare systems in the US, overlooking the fact that government funding plays a substantial role in medical research and technological advancement.  Additionally, the review suggests that rationing promotes cost-effectiveness, which is not inherently negative.  In a resource-constrained environment, prioritizing cost-effective solutions allows for broader access to essential care while simultaneously encouraging the search for less expensive and more efficient methods, ultimately fostering innovation. This multifaceted perspective demonstrates that rationing, when implemented thoughtfully, can drive progress rather than hinder it.",

The article \"Structuring Your Data for Analytics\" (8_0) highlights the benefits of structured data, particularly for large-scale analysis.  Standardized formats and organized data facilitate efficient querying and identification of trends, which can be directly applied to rationing systems. For example, by tracking resource utilization, wait times, and patient outcomes within a structured system, we can identify areas of over or under-allocation. This data-driven approach allows for evidence-based adjustments to allocation criteria, addressing potential inequities and improving overall system effectiveness. While opponents argue that rationing infringes on autonomy (from the provided arguments), a structured, data-driven system promotes transparency and accountability, allowing for continuous monitoring and refinement based on objective data, ultimately leading to a more just and efficient allocation of scarce resources.  Moreover, the improved allocation criteria can incorporate ethical considerations and prioritize vulnerable populations, directly addressing concerns about discrimination raised by opponents (from the provided arguments).",

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain.

The evidence provided, an article from the Heritage Foundation, lacks sufficient detail to substantiate the claim that government involvement makes patients passive recipients and erodes trust. Furthermore, the claim focuses solely on the potential negative impact on individual liberties while ignoring the crucial ways government improves healthcare autonomy.  The \"Essay: National Government, Crisis, and Civil Liberties\" from the Bill of Rights Institute highlights the balance between liberty and national security.  Similarly, government involvement in healthcare can focus on ensuring quality and access without impinging on individual autonomy in decision-making. The \"Classical Liberalism\" article underscores the importance of individual freedom, which a well-designed healthcare system can promote by enabling informed choices through better access and information. Government rationing, while necessitating some limitations, doesn't automatically strip individuals of their right to choose their treatments in consultation with medical professionals. Hence, the claim oversimplifies the complex interplay between individual autonomy and government's role in optimizing healthcare systems.",

This balance is crucial in ensuring that while the government maintains order and security, it does not encroach on the personal liberties of its citizens. Government overreach refers to the excessive use of power by authorities beyond what is constitutionally permitted. This overextension can have profound implications on individual rights and liberties, often leading to legal battles and public outcry.

This vision is the bedrock of classical liberalism, a political philosophy that championed individual liberty and minimal state interference during a time when feudalism was crumbling. But what does classical liberalism truly entail, and how did it shape modern political thought? Let\u2019s dive into the rich history and core principles of classical liberalism to uncover its enduring influence. The rise of classical liberalism \ud83d\udd17 The emergence of classical liberalism can be traced back to the 17th and 18th centuries, a period marked by significant social, economic, and political upheaval. The decline of feudalism, characterized by rigid hierarchical structures and land-based economies, set the stage for new ideas to take root. As the old order began to disintegrate, thinkers and philosophers started to advocate for a society where individuals could thrive based on their own merits and efforts. Key thinkers of classical liberalism \ud83d\udd17 Several influential thinkers played pivotal roles in shaping classical liberalism. Their ideas laid the foundation for a political philosophy that continues to resonate today. Let\u2019s explore the contributions of John Locke, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham: Core principles of classical liberalism \ud83d\udd17 At its heart, classical liberalism is built on several key principles that collectively champion individual freedom and limited government intervention. Let\u2019s delve into these core tenets: Individual liberty \ud83d\udd17 Central to classical liberalism is the concept of individual liberty. This principle asserts that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices and pursue their own goals without undue interference from the state or other external forces. This idea of freedom is often referred to as \u201cnegative liberty,\u201d which emphasizes the absence of constraints on individual actions. Private pro",

Federal agencies, guided by the Office of Management and Budget are now busy implementing the executive order which includes conducting agency-wide equity assessments and developing plans to address equity barriers. Based on Third Sector's experience providing technical assistance, training, coaching, and thought partnership to over 50 state and county-level government agencies working to improve outcomes for historically marginalized and excluded populations, we offer a framework, for how federal (as well as state and local agencies) can assess and reorient their systems to achieve improved and equitable outcomes. This framework involves two guiding principles and six \"building blocks\" that collectively determine how opportunities and benefits reach people. Achieving an equitable distribution of opportunities and benefits means embracing the principles while taking concrete action within each building block. The guiding principles include acknowledging past harm and centering end-users. The building blocks include internal culture, external relationships, data, services & technical assistance, policy, and funding.

The Journey from Gridlock to Green Lights The relentless growth of urban populations and the corresponding surge in vehicle ownership have led to an unprecedented strain on city infrastructures, particularly roads. This has resulted in chronic gridlock, a situation where the demand for road space far exceeds its supply, leading to traffic congestion that plagues commuters daily. The traditional approach to tackling this issue has been to expand road capacity or improve public transportation systems.

Future Directions for Fair Resource Rationing Priority Groups: Priority Protocols: Rationing Resources Fairly 1. Ethical Considerations Resource rationing is a critical and often contentious issue, particularly in the context of healthcare, where resources can be scarce and the demand often exceeds supply. The ethical considerations surrounding resource rationing are complex and multifaceted, involving a delicate balance between efficiency, equity, and respect for individual rights. Different ethical frameworks offer varying insights into how resources should be allocated, and these perspectives can sometimes conflict, making the decision-making process even more challenging. From a utilitarian perspective, the focus is on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, which may lead to prioritizing those who could gain the most benefit from the resources. For example, during a pandemic, vaccines might be rationed first to healthcare workers and vulnerable populations, as they are at higher risk and their well-being is crucial to society's functioning. In contrast, a deontological approach would emphasize the importance of equal respect and dignity for all individuals, suggesting that resources should be distributed without regard to the potential outcomes. This might mean allocating resources on a first-come, first-served basis, or through a lottery system, to ensure that no individual is favored over anoth",

While the opponent's cited study in the \\\"Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health\\\" suggests rationing's potential negative impacts on vulnerable groups, focusing solely on this risk ignores the potential for mitigation through thoughtful system design and rigorous oversight. \\\"Road Space Rationing\\\" (1_0) provides a concrete example of how transparency can build public trust and acceptance. Specifically, restricting vehicles based on license plate numbers offers a clear, objective criterion understood and accepted by the public. Mexico City's \\\"Hoy No Circula\\\" program demonstrates a real-world implementation of such a system. Conversely, \\\"Rationing: Rationing Resources\\\" (1_6) examines Venezuela's rationing system, which lacked transparency and faced public backlash, underscoring that good governance is essential for equitable outcomes. Thus, rather than an inherent flaw of rationing, inequity stems from poorly implemented systems lacking transparency and oversight. The evidence suggests that government rationing, when implemented strategically and transparently, can indeed achieve equitable resource allocation, directly refuting the opponent's claim.",

Federal agencies, guided by the Office of Management and Budget are now busy implementing the executive order which includes conducting agency-wide equity assessments and developing plans to address equity barriers. Based on Third Sector's experience providing technical assistance, training, coaching, and thought partnership to over 50 state and county-level government agencies working to improve outcomes for historically marginalized and excluded populations, we offer a framework, for how federal (as well as state and local agencies) can assess and reorient their systems to achieve improved and equitable outcomes. This framework involves two guiding principles and six \"building blocks\" that collectively determine how opportunities and benefits reach people. Achieving an equitable distribution of opportunities and benefits means embracing the principles while taking concrete action within each building block. The guiding principles include acknowledging past harm and centering end-users. The building blocks include internal culture, external relationships, data, services & technical assistance, policy, and funding. GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF AN EQUITY-FOCUSED GOVERNMENT Guiding Principle 1: Acknowledge the racial inequities of past policies, practices, and attitudes.\u00a0 To reach a state of racial equity, it is necessary to first redress the racism-rooted harms of historic policies and practices that systematically prevent Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) from accessing the same benefits and opportunities as white people in America.

Federal agencies, guided by the Office of Management and Budget are now busy implementing the executive order which includes conducting agency-wide equity assessments and developing plans to address equity barriers. Based on Third Sector's experience providing technical assistance, training, coaching, and thought partnership to over 50 state and county-level government agencies working to improve outcomes for historically marginalized and excluded populations, we offer a framework, for how federal (as well as state and local agencies) can assess and reorient their systems to achieve improved and equitable outcomes. This framework involves two guiding principles and six \"building blocks\" that collectively determine how opportunities and benefits reach people. Achieving an equitable distribution of opportunities and benefits means embracing the principles while taking concrete action within each building block. The guiding principles include acknowledging past harm and centering end-users.

It emphasizes fair processes and using ethical values as core principles for allocating scarce resources.  Although focusing on inter-state resource allocation, its underlying principles are applicable to other resource distribution scenarios.  This framework considers factors beyond simple equality, acknowledging the complex needs of diverse populations and striving for just outcomes.  For example, it explicitly addresses the need to balance the demands of various stakeholders using ethical guidelines.  While potential biases in framework design are a valid concern, the emphasis on transparency and established ethical principles, coupled with incorporating diverse perspectives as recommended in \"Building an Equitable Government\" (4_6), mitigates this risk.

The study \"Rationing in healthcare\u2014a scoping review\" (6_30, 6_31), which examined seven articles on healthcare rationing, reveals that resource scarcity, the core driver of rationing, actually fosters innovation. The review shows that when resources are limited, healthcare systems are compelled to find more efficient and effective ways to deliver care, leading to the development of novel treatment methods and care delivery models.  This directly contradicts the presented claim, demonstrating how rationing can create an environment conducive to innovation.  Moreover, the opponent's claim relies on a simplistic comparison between private and government-run healthcare systems in the US, overlooking the fact that government funding plays a substantial role in medical research and technological advancement.  Additionally, the review suggests that rationing promotes cost-effectiveness, which is not inherently negative.  In a resource-constrained environment, prioritizing cost-effective solutions allows for broader access to essential care while simultaneously encouraging the search for less expensive and more efficient methods, ultimately fostering innovation. This multifaceted perspective demonstrates that rationing, when implemented thoughtfully, can drive progress rather than hinder it.",

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations.

This ideal, however, doesn't preclude government involvement in essential services like healthcare where its role can be to empower individual choice rather than restrict it. Government can ensure wider access and affordability, facilitating greater autonomy in healthcare decisions.  Equating rationing with oppressive state control misrepresents how a well-designed system can actually enhance individual freedom by expanding access to critical services. Furthermore, the Heritage Foundation's focus on passive recipients ignores that increased access, due to government investment, can make more individuals active participants, contradicting the cited article.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: {'claim': 'Government rationing can lead to inequitable access and discrimination.', 'argument': ['Rationing decisions may be influenced by biases, leading to disparities and unequal treatment of certain populations.', 'A study in the \\\\\"Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health\\\\\" indicates that rationing can disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, exacerbating existing health disparities and violating the ethical principle of justice.']}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_0', 'query': 'Examples of rationing systems with transparent criteria and public acceptance', 'title': 'Road Space Rationing: From Congestion to Clarity: Road Space Rationing ...', 'url': 'https://fastercapital.com/content/Road-Space-Rationing--From-Congestion-to-Clarity--Road-Space-Rationing-as-a-Complement-to-Congestion-Pricing.html'}, {'id': '1_1', 'query': 'Examples of rationing systems with transparent criteria and public acceptance', 'title': 'Priority Groups: Priority Protocols: Rationing Resources Fairly', 'url': 'https://fastercapital.com/content/Priority-Groups--Priority-Protocols--Rationing-Resources-Fairly.html'}]\n**Medium Argument**: While rationing carries a risk of bias, examples of successful, transparent systems challenge the claim that it inherently leads to inequitable access.  \\\"Road Space Rationing\\\" (1_0) describes how transparent criteria and public acceptance work together.  Moreover, \\\"Priority Groups\\\" (1_1) highlights accountability mechanisms in resource allocation, showcasing government's ability to prevent discrimination.  Successful implementation relies on fairness, transparency, and accountability, elements achievable through proper governance, therefore negating the claim's negativity.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: {'claim': 'Rationing negatively impacts quality and innovation in healthcare.', 'argument': ['Rationing reduces incentives for healthcare providers to innovate or improve services, leading to longer wait times and decreased quality of care.', 'Data from the United States suggests that private sector involvement leads to better efficiency and innovation compared to government-run systems, as competition motivates providers to offer higher quality services.']}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_30', 'query': 'Arguments for and against rationing in healthcare and its impact on innovation', 'title': 'Rationing in healthcare-a scoping review - PubMed', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37415702/'}, {'id': '6_31', 'query': 'Arguments for and against rationing in healthcare and its impact on innovation', 'title': '(PDF) Rationing in healthcare\u2014a scoping review - ResearchGate', 'url': 'https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371766575_Rationing_in_healthcare-a_scoping_review'}]\n**Short Argument**: The claim that rationing stifles innovation is unfounded.  Rationing, by its nature, necessitates the efficient allocation of scarce resources, which can drive innovation in cost-effective treatments and care delivery. The review \"Rationing in healthcare\u2014a scoping review\" (6_30, 6_31) highlights this, demonstrating that resource scarcity encourages the development of innovative solutions. This directly contradicts the claim's premise by demonstrating that rationing can be a catalyst for, rather than an impediment to, innovation.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: {'claim': 'Government oversight minimizes the potential for discriminatory practices by private entities in allocating scarce resources.', 'argument': []}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_5', 'query': 'Examples of government oversight preventing discriminatory practices in resource allocation.', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://www.ignet.gov/sites/default/files/files/ToolkitforConsideringEquityWhenConductingOversightWork.pdf'}, {'id': '4_6', 'query': 'Government agency guidelines for equitable resource distribution', 'title': 'Building an Equitable Government: The What, the Why, and the How', 'url': 'https://www.thirdsectorcap.org/blog/building-an-equitable-government-the-what-the-why-and-the-how/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Government oversight promotes equitable resource allocation by establishing transparent criteria and accountability mechanisms. The \"Toolkit for Considering Equity When Conducting Oversight Work\" (2_5) emphasizes the government's role in ensuring accountability in resource use, minimizing the potential for discriminatory practices by private entities.  Furthermore, government agencies, through established guidelines, can direct resources to communities based on need, as suggested in \"Building an Equitable Government\" (4_6), further reducing the likelihood of biased allocation by private actors.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: {'claim': 'A structured rationing system facilitates data collection and analysis, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of allocation criteria.', 'argument': []}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_0', 'query': 'Benefits of structured rationing systems for data collection and analysis', 'title': 'Structuring Your Data for Analytics: Best Practices and Benefits - SCi 2.0', 'url': 'https://www.silvercreek.io/post/structuring-your-data-for-analytics-best-practices-and-benefits'}]\n**Short Argument**: Structured rationing systems inherently improve data collection and analysis.  Standardized data formats, as highlighted in \"Structuring Your Data for Analytics\" (8_0), enable efficient storage, querying, and analysis, particularly crucial for large datasets. This structured approach allows for easier identification of trends, resource allocation gaps, and areas for improvement, thereby refining allocation criteria and promoting a more equitable and effective system.\n\n\n"

        "statements": "My opponents raise concerns about government rationing infringing upon personal autonomy. They argue that government involvement leads to a loss of personal freedom in healthcare choices. However, this argument misconstrues the role of government in healthcare.  The government's role can be to empower individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability, facilitating greater autonomy in healthcare decisions.  Think about it \u2013 increased access, due to government investment, can make more individuals active participants in their healthcare, not passive recipients as our opponents suggest, citing the Heritage Foundation. In fact, their argument overlooks how a well-designed rationing system can actually enhance individual freedom by expanding access to critical services, directly contradicting their claim.\n\nThey also claim that government rationing can lead to inequitable access and discrimination. While we acknowledge the potential for bias, examples of successful, transparent systems challenge this notion.  Consider road space rationing, where transparent criteria and public acceptance work together effectively [1].  Moreover, established priority protocols in resource allocation demonstrate the government's ability to prevent discrimination and ensure accountability [2].  These examples highlight that successful implementation relies on fairness, transparency, and accountability, elements achievable through proper governance, thereby mitigating the risk of inequity.\n\nFurthermore, our opponents argue that rationing negatively impacts quality and innovation.  This simply isn\u2019t true. Rationing, by its very nature, necessitates the efficient allocation of scarce resources, which can actually drive innovation in cost-effective treatments and care delivery. Research even supports this, demonstrating that resource scarcity encourages the development of innovative solutions [3, 4]. This directly contradicts our opponents' claim, showing that rationing can be a catalyst for, rather than an impediment to, innovation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address a crucial point they overlooked: the risk of discriminatory practices by private entities in allocating scarce resources.  Government oversight is key here.  It promotes equitable resource allocation by establishing transparent criteria and accountability mechanisms.  The \"Toolkit for Considering Equity When Conducting Oversight Work\" emphasizes the government's role in ensuring accountability in resource use, minimizing the potential for discriminatory practices by private entities [5].  Furthermore, government agencies can direct resources to communities based on need through established guidelines [6], further reducing the likelihood of biased allocation by private actors.\n\nFinally, our opponents suggest alternative solutions, focusing on efficiency and competition.  While these are important, they fail to address the immediate need for resource allocation in a scarcity scenario. A structured rationing system, however, facilitates data collection and analysis, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of allocation criteria [7].  This data-driven approach allows for easier identification of trends, resource allocation gaps, and areas for improvement, thereby promoting a more equitable and effective system. In contrast, their proposed solutions lack this structured approach to data analysis and system improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, while our opponents raise valid concerns, their arguments fail to consider the potential benefits and safeguards of a well-implemented government rationing system.  Our approach prioritizes not only individual liberties but also equitable access, innovation, and continuous improvement in resource allocation, ensuring the best possible outcomes in a situation of scarcity.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] FasterCapital.

        "statements": "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI have attentively considered my opponent's arguments advocating for government rationing of healthcare resources. While their intentions to ensure equitable access and enhance autonomy are commendable, their perspective overlooks fundamental issues inherent in such government intervention.\n\nFirstly, my opponent contends that government rationing empowers individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability. However, this view fails to acknowledge that increased government control often leads to diminished personal autonomy. As noted in an article by the Heritage Foundation, government-controlled healthcare can result in patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions. Centralizing decision-making with government officials strips individuals and their doctors of the ability to make personalized choices, replacing them with one-size-fits-all policies that cannot cater to the unique needs of each patient.\n\nMoreover, the assertion that government involvement enhances access ignores the inefficiencies typically associated with bureaucratic systems. Countries with government-run healthcare often experience longer wait times and delays in receiving care. According to \"Economics Help.org,\" increased government control can lead to decreased efficiency and reduced quality of care due to lack of competition and profit motive. This undermines the very autonomy and timely access my opponent suggests will be improved.\n\nSecondly, my opponent draws parallels between healthcare rationing and road space rationing, citing it as an example of successful government intervention. This comparison is flawed. Managing traffic congestion is vastly different from making life-and-death healthcare decisions. Healthcare involves complex, deeply personal choices that cannot be effectively governed by broad, generalized protocols without sacrificing individual needs and ethical considerations.\n\nWhile my opponent argues that government rationing can prevent discrimination through established priority protocols, history demonstrates that government systems are not immune to bias and inequality. Bureaucratic decision-making can inadvertently perpetuate systemic disparities. Vulnerable populations may continue to face barriers within a government-controlled system, and the lack of accountability can make it difficult to address these injustices.\n\nThirdly, the claim that rationing spurs innovation by necessitating efficient resource allocation overlooks the reality that innovation thrives in competitive environments. Government rationing can stifle innovation by imposing funding limitations and removing incentives for private entities to invest in research and development. The private sector, driven by competition and the pursuit of excellence, is more likely to produce innovative solutions that improve care and reduce costs.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent warns of discriminatory practices by private entities and suggests that government oversight is the remedy. However, excessive government intervention can lead to increased bureaucracy and red tape, hindering the responsiveness and adaptability of the healthcare system. Proper regulation, rather than outright control, can mitigate risks without compromising efficiency and patient-centered care.\n\nLastly, my opponent critiques market-based solutions for not addressing immediate scarcity. Yet, evidence indicates that enhancing efficiency and fostering competition can effectively manage resources. As highlighted by \"Economics Help.org,\" private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition driving improvements in quality and cost reduction\n\n**Reference**\n1.

The problem is healthcare will never be free. Whether its run by government or the private sector it will always cost money. The problem is whether or not you would like to be able to pick and choose what services you would like and what quality of care you would like to receive. The biggest point in the article is that the private sector has incentives to provide the best quality care possible while if it was operated by the government, individual healthcare workers lose many competitive factors that drive their efficiency to the maximum. The only positive is that healthcare becomes available to all people rather than to only those who can afford it. I believe the obvious fix to this is to have the government provide it for those who cant afford it but never force those who can afford to pay for their own onto their system.

PMC Copyright notice PMCID: PMC1615628\u00a0\u00a0PMID: 7573634 Abstract With adequate cost containment unlikely in the foreseeable future, health care use will have to be curtailed, ideally with open and explicit criteria for equitably allocating resources or rationing. Yet, consensus on any such criteria appears remote because Americans cannot say no to health care. Americans may refuse to accept rationing for two reasons. The absence of any global limitation on health care resources may encourage patients to believe that health care resources are not scarce and do not need",

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

Author Affiliation Abstract Health care rationing has been a source of contentious debate in the United States for nearly 30 years. Because rationing is bewildering to many Americans, persistent myths about \"death panels\" and critical health care decisions to be made by faceless bureaucrats abound, instilling fear about health care reform and cost containment measures aimed at slowing spending growth. This paper retrospectively reviews the policy literature on health care rationing over the past quarter century, examines alternative definitions and classification schemes, traces the evolution of the debate, and explores ways in which rationing may be made more rational, transparent, and equitable in the future allocation of scarce health care resources.

LAMMt INTRODUCTION Americans find certain issues in public policy much easier to ignore than to confront. The necessity of rationing health care is one such issue. Because Americans believe that access to health care is a basic right,1 we, as a society, have avoided facing the hard fact that it is not feasible to provide, on demand, all needed medical procedures to every individual who could potentially benefit from them. Unlimited needs, or at least unlimited perceived needs, eventually outstrip limited resources. For this reason, we have avoided open discussions about rationing; it inevitably would become clear to all engaged in such a discussion that rationing entails denying individuals some measure of health care that otherwise would benefit them. Rationing is felt to be unfair, unethical, and potentially discriminatory. Every health care provider knows that we already ration health care. Much has been written about the thirty-five to thirty-seven million Americans who have no health insurance and the approxi-mately thirty million others who have inadequate insurance. Upon consideration, we cannot deny that we already ration by price, geography, and a number of other means. We tell each other, however, that this is \"indirect rationing\" and apparently we find it morally easier to accept indirect rationing than \"direct rationing.\" A sin of omission is easier to live with than a sin of commission. I. BETTER HEALTH THROUGH RATIONING A more positive case for rationing can readily be made: We can have better health through rationing. Today, the United States has the worst form of rationing-rationing by excluding people from the health care system entirely.

Preventive health care involves taking steps to prevent illnesses or detect health issues early on when they are more manageable. This approach shifts the focus from merely treating existing conditions to actively working towards maintaining optimal health. Preventive care is key for promoting well-being, improving health outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs by addressing health issues before they become more serious or costly. What counts as preventive care? Preventive care services involve regular check-ups, health screenings, vaccinations and other lifestyle changes. Health-promoting activities such as stress management, good sleep and hygiene, also fall under the umbrella of preventive care.

This innovative healthcare model deviates from traditional health insurance paradigms by placing a strong emphasis on preventive measures, aiming to maintain patient health rather than just responding to illness. Unlike conventional models that may prioritize volume over value, DPC focuses on fostering deep, meaningful relationships between patients and their primary care providers. This article delves into how DPC\u00e2\u0080\u0099s foundation in preventative care not only enhances long-term health outcomes but also presents a sustainable solution to the escalating costs plaguing our healthcare system. Through a detailed exploration of DPC's operational model and the economic implications of a prevention-focused approach, we aim to shed light on the transformative potential of integrating preventative care into healthcare delivery. As we navigate through the intricacies of Direct Primary Care, we will address some of the most pressing questions surrounding its value, operational differences from concierge medicine, and the tangible benefits it offers to patients and the broader healthcare landscape. Join us in uncovering the core principles of DPC and its pivotal role in shaping a healthier, more sustainable future for healthcare. The Rise of Direct Primary Care Direct Primary Care (DPC) is more than just a healthcare trend; it's a revolutionary approach that reimagines the patient-provider relationship at its core. Its ascent in the healthcare landscape is a direct response to the growing frustration with the complexities and inefficiencies of traditional health insurance models, which often place financial and administrative burdens on both patients and physicians.

Analyses utilized reports from a longitudinal panel of 4,407 participants, followed since the study\u2019s baseline in Grade 5, with most recent follow-up 12 years later at age 23. Impacts on lifetime abstinence from primary outcomes of substance use and antisocial behavior were estimated using generalized linear mixed Poisson regression analysis, adjusted for individual and community-level covariates. Possible cascading effects on 4-year college completion, major depressive disorder, and generalized anxiety disorder through age 23 were evaluated as secondary outcomes. CTC had a statistically significant global effect on primary outcomes and also on combined primary and secondary outcomes. Among primary outcomes, point estimates suggested absolute improvements in lifetime abstinence of 3.5% to 6.1% in the intervention arm, and relative improvements of 13% to 55%; 95% confidence intervals revealed some uncertainty in estimates.

Chronic diseases are a tremendous burden to both patients and the health care system. In 2014, 60% of adult Americans had at least one chronic disease or condition, and 42% had multiple diseases (1). Chronic diseases, including heart disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, stroke, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and chronic kidney disease, are the leading causes of poor health, long-term disability, and death in the United States (2,3). One-third of all deaths in this country are attributable to heart disease or stroke, and every year, more than 1.7 million people receive a diagnosis of cancer (2). During the past several decades, the prevalence of diabetes increased dramatically; in 2015 more than 29 million Americans had diabetes and another 86 million adults had prediabetes, increasing their chance of developing type 2 diabetes (3). Diabetes increases the risk of developing other chronic diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and hypertension, and is the leading cause of end-stage renal failure (4). Chronic diseases can profoundly reduce quality of life for patients and for their families, affecting enjoyment of life, family relationships, and finances (5). Working can be difficult for people with chronic diseases: rates of absenteeism are higher and income is often lower among people who have a chronic disease compared with people who do not have one. Functional limitations can be distressing, and depression, which can reduce a patient\u2019s ability to cope with pain and worsen the clinical course of disease, is a common complication (6). Chronic diseases are also the leading drivers of health care costs in the United States (2). In 201",

Abstract A central plank of health care reform is an expanded role for educated consumers interacting with responsive health care teams. However, for individuals to realize the benefits of health education also requires a high level of engagement. Population studies have documented a gap between expectations and the actual performance of behaviours related to participation in health care and prevention. Interventions to improve self-care have shown improvements in self-efficacy, patient satisfaction, coping skills, and perceptions of social support. Significant clinical benefits have been seen from trials of self-management or lifestyle interventions across conditions such as diabetes, coronary heart disease, heart failure and rheumatoid arthritis. However, the focus of many studies has been on short-term outcomes rather that long term effects. There is also some evidence that participation in patient education programs is not spread evenly across socio economic groups. This review considers three other issues that may be important in increasing the public health impact of patient education. The first is health literacy, which is the capacity to seek, understan",

A recent study in Health Affairs by Professor of Health Care Policy, Bruce Landon, MD, MBA, MSc and coauthors measures the impact of recent policy initiatives on the delivery of preventative care by addressing the following questions. Using National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) data collected from 2001-2019, they examined outpatient visits to primary care physicians and focused on the purpose and outcome of these visits. Findings revealed that the proportion of primary care visits with a preventive focus nearly doubled from 2001-2019. The study also found that visits with a preventive focus tended to be longer, more likely to include counseling, and were associated with increased use of preventive labs and imaging procedures. The study suggests that the increasing preventive visits was made possible by insurance coverage expansion, such as the ACA, which improved access for preventive care. The nature of these visits allowed physicians to take are more comprehensive approach in addressing latent problems before they become urgent; however the decline in problem oriented visits suggests that ov",

Although rationing, when applied to health care, is a fearful word to the elderly, at the most basic level it is simply a method that enables government to intervene in the private marketplace to allocate resources to achieve particular policy ends. This intervention to affect allocation of health care resources has long been used by all levels of government in the United States. Intervention by government in the private marketplace is examined as a means of expanding or limiting the supply of health care services or expanding or limiting the demand for such services. The Oregon rationing experiment with Medicaid services has significantly contributed to the introduction of the concept of rationing of health care. As expected, there is a disproportionate interest by the elderly in rationing health care; thus the effect of the Oregon rationing experiment on the elderly is discussed, as are other allocation interventions on long-term care, as a service of particular interest to the elderly.

The COVID-19 pandemic has placed unmitigated pressure on the availability of resources of all categories1. This pressure has affected virtually every nation on earth \u2014 regardless of national income level \u2014 and has forced planning and/or the implementation of health-\u200b care rationing almost universally. Rationing has always carried negative connotations and, until the current crisis, its mention would have at least raised some eyebrows, if not invited outright condemnation by members of civil society and many health-\u200b care workers. However, the need to potentially restrict the allocation of health-\u200b care resources in face of the relentless onslaught of COVID-19 has been widely accepted as a required response to the pandemic. The matter-\u200b of-\u200b fact development of recommendations for prioritized triaging of critically ill patients based on ethical principles gained rapid acceptance1,2. The initial graphic scenes of patients dying in hospital corridors because of the lack of critical care beds played itself out nightly in homes around the world \u2014 not in low-\u200b income countries but in some of the most prosperous nations on earth. The fact that older individuals were the main victims of these ad hoc rationing policies somehow seemed to make the process \u2018acceptable\u2019. Although unprecedented in high-\u200b income countries (HICs), this situation reflects the everyday reality of the majority of the world\u2019s popu\u00ad lation, who live in low- and middle- \u200b income countries (LMICs) where access to life-\u200b saving treatments is limited or absent. An implicit global double standard has long upheld that rationing was unacceptable for HICs but was tolerable",

LAMMt INTRODUCTION Americans find certain issues in public policy much easier to ignore than to confront. The necessity of rationing health care is one such issue. Because Americans believe that access to health care is a basic right,1 we, as a society, have avoided facing the hard fact that it is not feasible to provide, on demand, all needed medical procedures to every individual who could potentially benefit from them. Unlimited needs, or at least unlimited perceived needs, eventually outstrip limited resources. For this reason, we have avoided open discussions about rationing; it inevitably would become clear to all engaged in such a discussion that rationing entails denying individuals some measure of health care that otherwise would benefit them. Rationing is felt to be unfair, unethical, and potentially discriminatory. Every health care provider knows that we already ration health care. Much has been written about the thirty-five to thirty-seven million Americans who have no health insurance and the approxi-mately thirty million others who have inadequate insurance. Upon consideration, we cannot deny that we already ration by price, geography, and a number of other means. We tell each other, however, that this is \"indirect rationing\" and apparently we find it morally easier to accept indirect rationing than \"direct rationing.\" A sin of omission is easier to live with than a sin of commission. I. BETTER HEALTH THROUGH RATIONING A more positive case for rationing can readily be made: We can have better health through rationing. Today, the United States has the worst form of rationing-rationing by excluding people from the health care system entirely.

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Citation PDF Altmetric On May 2, 1990, Oregonians woke up to the headline, \u201cState to Unveil Health Care Priorities for the Poor.\u201d And so began the public phase of the great health care rationing debate [1]. Rationing is a problematic concept in medical ethics; it\u2019s also a reality in the lives of many Americans. And that is why the Oregon Health Plan (OHP) has become a perennial in the world of health care reform controversies. That morning in 1990, many Oregonians got their first look at a priorities list of about 2,000 procedures, also known as the \u201cfirst list\u201d (or later as \u201cthe first list, quickly dumped\u201d [2]). Other lists followed. The state was attempting to decide which procedures its Medicaid program should cover. To most people, that spelled rationing. The most current list is\u00a0Prioritization of Health Services, a Report to the Governor and the 75th Oregon Legislative Assembly\u00a0[3]. The health services commission refers proudly to it as \u201cthe world\u2019s first prioritized list of health services\u201d [4]. A history of the health plan is also on the state\u2019s web site, and is a good introduction to the subject [5]. The importance of the list in the annals of American health policy is that Oregon tried to develop a transparent process for prioritizing medical services through its laws and regulations. That\u2019s the real impact. Rather than relying on undisclosed private decisions by individuals or insurers, Oregon developed a public process. ",

Because many of the central issues are the same in all systems, the United States and other countries can learn from the successes and failures of countries that have explicitly addressed the question of health care priorities. We review explicit priority setting efforts in Norway, Sweden, Israel, the Netherlands, Denmark, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the state of Oregon in the US. The approaches used can be divided into those centered on outlining principles versus those that define practices. In order to establish the main lessons from their experiences we consider (1) the process each country used, (2) criteria to judge the success of these efforts, (3) which approaches seem to have met these criteria, and (4) using their successes and failures as a guide, how to proceed in setting priorities.

Because many of the central issues are the same in all systems, the United States and other countries can learn from the successes and failures of countries that have explicitly addressed the question of health care priorities. We review explicit priority setting efforts in Norway, Sweden, Israel, the Netherlands, Denmark, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the state of Oregon in the US. The approaches used can be divided into those centered on outlining principles versus those that define practices. In order to establish the main lessons from their experiences we consider (1) the process each country used, (2) criteria to judge the success of these efforts, (3) which approaches seem to have met these criteria, and (4) using their successes and failures as a guide, how to proceed in setting priorities. We demonstrate that there is little evidence that establishment of a values framework for priority setting has had any effect on health policy, nor is there evidence that priority setting exercises have led to the envisaged ideal of an open and participatory public involvement in decision making.

Issue date 2020 Nov. Abstract Introduction Patients with multiple chronic conditions (multimorbidity) are commonly seen in primary care practices and often have suboptimal uptake of preventive care owing to competing treatment demands. The complexity of multimorbidity patterns and their impact on receiving preventive services is not fully understood. This study identifies multimorbidity combinations associated with low receipt of preventive services. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study of U.S. community health center patients aged \u226519 years. Electronic health record data from 209 community health centers for the January 1, 2014\u2013December 31, 2017 study period were analyzed in 2018\u20132019. Multimorbidity patterns included: \u201cphysical only,\u201d \u201cmental health only,\u201d and \u201cphysical and mental health\u201d multimorbidity patterns, with \u201cno multimorbidity\u201d as a reference category. Electronic health record\u2013based preventive ratios (number of months services were up-to-date/total months the patient was eligible for services) were calculated for the 14 preventive services.

It is covered under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and helps keeps health care costs low. Learn more about what counts as preventive care and how this affects your health care and insurance costs. Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

Those with multiple chronic conditions make up 30% of Medicaid beneficiaries and 83% of spending. Use of preventive services may increase with monetary and logistic support, such as providing transportation. Chronic conditions are the leading causes of death and have large health care costs. Chronic conditions are illnesses that last one year or more and require medical care or limit daily activities (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2024a). Most chronic conditions are caused by smoking, excessive alcohol use, lack of exercise, and poor nutrition (CDC 2024a). The most common chronic conditions are obesity, depression, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol (Watson et al. 2022). In the US, 1 in 3 deaths is due to heart disease or stroke (CDC 2024b).

This research aims to investigate how the optimal allocation of medical resources between prevention and treatment adds value to the population\u2019s health as well as examine the interaction between ageing, health, and economic performance. Methods This research undertakes ageing-health analyses by developing an economic growth model. Based on the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) countries\u2019 experiences over the period from 2000 to 2017, this research further examines the hypothesis that an ageing society could increase demand for preventive and curative healthcare. Results Theoretical analysis found that the prevention share for maximizing growth is the same as that for minimizing ill health and maximizing welfare; this share increases with treatment share and ageing ratios. Estimation results from OECD countries\u2019 experiences indicate that when treatment share increases by 1%, the prevention demand increases by 0.036%. A one-percent increase in the ageing ratio yields a change in prevention share of 0.0368%. The optimal share of prevention health expenditure to GDP would be 1.175% when the prevalence rate of ill health isat 6.13%; a higher or lower share of prevention would be accompanied with a higher prevalence of ill health.

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity. Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and s",

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 90% of the nation\u2019s $4.5 trillion annual healthcare spending goes to treating people with chronic and mental health conditions. This figure highlights the urgent need for a shift in priorities. Imagine how much healthier Americans could be\u2014and how much money could be saved\u2014if the focus moved from reactive care to preventive care. Such a shift would improve individual outcomes and create a more sustainable healthcare system. Reactive vs. Preventive Care The healthcare system operates through two primary approaches: reactive care and preventive care. Reactive care focuses on treating illnesses and conditions after they develop. Most medical providers in the U.S. follow this model, which often delays intervention until a health problem becomes serious. For example, patients with diabetes might only seek treatment after symptoms worsen, leading to hospitalizations or long-term complications. On the other hand, preventive care emphasizes measures taken to avoid diseases altogether. These include vaccinations, screenings, early detection, and healthy lifestyle interventions. By addressing potential health risks early, preventive care can reduce the need for costly treatments later.

Analysis of the cost-effectiveness of preventive care can guide policy-makers to allocate scarce resources. This synthesis reviews the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of clinical preventive care. Key findings include: although many preventive services are a good value (defined as costing less than $50,000 to $100,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Year), only a few, such as childhood immunizations and counseling adults on the use of low-dose aspirin are widely regarded as cost-saving. Costs to reduce risk factors, screening costs, and the cost of treatment when disease is found can offset any savings from preventive care. Prevention can reduce the incidence of disease, but savings may be partially offset by health care costs associated with increased longevity. Whether these additional competing risk costs outweigh the savings from avoiding the targeted disease depends on how healthy people are during the added life years. Given that so few preventive services save money and that these services are already in wide use, it is unlikely that prevention can reduce health care spending. The authors question whether the emphasis on savings is appropriate and s",

Key Takeaways What Is Preventive Care? Preventive care, or preventative care, is health care that prevents disease, injury, or illness, rather than treating a condition that has already become catastrophic or acute. The goal of preventive care is to help people stay healthy. Preventive care can include: Preventive care also keeps people productive and active, enabling them to keep earning well into their senior years. In 2019, for example, health problems forced 35%\u00a0of retired people into early retirement before they were financially ready. Access to affordable preventative care can help lower these numbers. Why Does Preventive Care Matter? Preventive care helps lower health care costs in America by\u00a0preventing or treating diseases before they require emergency care.\u00a0 Hospital care is very expensive, making up about a third of all health care costs in America. The cost of emergency room care for the uninsured can be extremely high. Hospitals are required to provide emergency care, even if the patient cannot afford to pay for the services they need. Because the hospital must recover these costs from somewhere, they get shifted to health insurance premiums and to Medicaid. This increases the costs of health care for everyone. In 2018, 21.3% of adults had one or more emergency room visits. Adults who do not have affordable access to preventive care are more likely to use the emergency room as their primary care physician. In 2014, 7.0% of adults aged 18 to 64 went because they had no other place to go for health care, regardless of health insurance status, while 77% went to the ER due to the seriousness of the problem (",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater equity. A number of countries have attempted to depoliticize decisions on rationing by using health technology assessments and dedicated agencies. Discussion: Resource allocation and rationing differ considerably between the US and Europe. In the US, where social welfare remains controversial, there are few restrictions on the use of health care technology regardless of cost or clinical effectiveness. European countries engage in more explicit debates about these limits, though these are complicated by media and lobby power. 1 Chief Science Officer, Los",

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service.

Both concepts are frequently the source of heated debate, leading to polarization of different health care practitioners and public parties. In some public arenas, rationing has become a dirty word. The term evidence-based medicine is perceived as being used as a \"cover\" for rationing. However, rationing is widespread, whether explicit or implicit, and exists within health care. Evidence-based medicine (or imaging) and rationing overlap considerably, and it looks like both are here to stay, given the current state of developed-world health care systems and the proposed reforms. The authors review these entities and argue that evidence-based medicine (or imaging) is one form of health care rationing. Rationing already occurs, and it is important that it be done in a way that provides the greater good for the majority. This article reviews the history of rationing and evidence-based medicine, the reasons evidence-based medicine and rationing are necessary, examples of rationing that already exist (economic), proposed forms of rationing (age based), the need for physicians (radiologists) to be at the forefront of any rationing efforts, and the ",

In constrained environments, healthcare providers often create unexpected solutions to provide adequate healthcare to patients. These inexpensive but effective frugal innovations may be imperfect, but they have the power to ensure that health is within reach of everyone. Frugal innovations are not limited to low-resource settings: ingenuous ideas can be adapted to offer simpler and disruptive alternatives to usual care all around the world, representing the concept of \u201creverse innovation\u201d. In this article, we discuss the different types of frugal innovations, illustrated with examples from the literature, and argue for the need to give voice to this neglected type of innovation in medicine. Peer Review reports Background The story goes that Laennec, who was embarrassed to put his ear on the chest of a young woman, used a sheaf of paper rolled into a cylinder to auscultate the heart and thus invented the stethoscope [1]. Today, we would have qualified his ingenuity as \u201cfrugal innovation\u201d. Frugal innovation is a broad term encompassing heterogeneous activities providing effective functional solutions to common problems encountered by \u201cthe many\u201d, with a minimal use of resources [2]. Innovations frequently arise in low-resource settings, when usual solutions are too expensive or not available. In these constrained environments, people work with what they have, using affordable but effective tools, processes and techniques to solve their problems. Two forces drive frugal innovation and contribute to the development of these tools, processes and/or techniques. One is from companies or is supported by organizations such as the WHO [3] or PATH [4], the leader ",

Abstract Healthcare innovation comprises an interactive and uneven process where different agents follow diverse rationales. Recent literature has stressed the role of hospitals as complex organizations that link health necessities and innovative solutions. Alternative innovation rationales to the mainstream innovation approach facilitate the creation of high quality solutions while promoting universal access to healthcare. Based on a case study in a public hospital located in a developing country, we show that frugal innovations, defined as a novel and satisfactory solution under resource scarcity conditions, are an adequate innovation approach for organizations operating under both severe resource restrictions and universal access to healthcare mandates. A frugal approach to innovation allows the hospital studied in this article to solve particular healthcare necessities in a specific domain. However, these processes of frugal innovation took place dissociated from the market and the public policy. Therefore, they remain circumscribed to the application context in which they emerged.

We leverage thousands of medical studies to estimate the quality of treatments for 13 health conditions and combine these estimates with insurance claims data to quantify how innovations diffuse and their impact on costs and quality. Across nearly all conditions we study, we find higher quality innovations diffuse. Like markets outside of healthcare, we find innovations can improve consumer welfare substantially.

This article examines the economic, historical, and demographic factors that have motivated increased attention to both these concepts, explores differences and similarities in the meaning of these terms, and discusses their ethical implications. Specifically, we identify four common sources of current debates on futility and rationing: the rise in health care costs; the development of high-technology medicine; the aging of society; and the effort to limit the scope of patient autonomy. We propose that when rationing criteria refer to medical benefit, the meanings of futility and rationing share certain common features. Futility and rationing differ, however, in important ways. Futility refers to treatment and outcome relationships not in a general population but in a specific patient. Rationing criteria usually are supported by reference to theories of justice, whereas the definition of futility, if achieved, will probably be arrived at by empirical community agreement. Rationing always occurs against a backdrop of resource scarcity, but futility need not. Toward the end of the paper, we clarify how the various connotations and contexts we associate with each term enhance or frustrate ethical debate. Recommended",

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II.

Affiliation Is rationing the inevitable consequence of medical advance? Author Affiliation Abstract The past decades have seen an impressive advance in medical technology. However, there are concerns about the growing costs of medical technology and the need to ration health care services. Some economists argue that the use of technology might be expensive now but that it would be unwise to ration technological advances as they will save money in the long-term. The author argues that increased productivity in health care does not necessarily lead to reduction of costs. In fact, it has often resulted in increased costs because such innovations made possible a widening of the indications for the treatment. Rationing of medical technology is inevitable, as further advances of technology will lead to higher pressures on the financing of the public health care system and the increased removal from the basic package of long-term care services for chronic conditions, the provision of which is an important responsibility of our society.

Both concepts are frequently the source of heated debate, leading to polarization of different health care practitioners and public parties. In some public arenas, rationing has become a dirty word. The term evidence-based medicine is perceived as being used as a \u201ccover\u201d for rationing. However, rationing is widespread, whether explicit or implicit, and exists within health care. Evidence-based medicine (or imaging) and rationing overlap considerably, and it looks like both are here to stay, given the current state of developed-world health care systems and the proposed reforms. The authors review these entities and argue that evidence-based medicine (or imaging) is one form of health care rationing. Rationing already occurs, and it is important that it be done in a way that provides the greater good for the majority. This article reviews the history of rationing and evidence-based medicine, the reasons evidence-based medicine and rationing are necessary, examples of rationing that already exist (economic), proposed forms of rationing (age based), the need for physicians (radiologists) to be at the forefront of any rationing efforts, and the basis (cost and comparative effectiveness research and eviden",

Therefore rationing is an inevitable occurrence in medicine and in critical care where the potential demand for effective medical care will exceed supply. Although there are many strategies to allocate medical resources one that is often considered is based on cost-effectiveness. Cost-effectiveness analysis attempts to estimate the value of individual medical treatments in terms of dollars and outcomes. Allocation of medical treatments based on cost-effectiveness analysis requires valid estimates of both the costs and the effectiveness of treatments as well as some overarching body with the authority to enforce allocation based on these analyses. Limitations of allocation based on cost-effectiveness analysis in critical care include difficulties in estimating marginal costs of critical care treatments, limited evidence for any treatments with efficacy, and the ethical principle of rescuing identifiable lives in imminent risk of death. The prospect of a pandemic influenza-like infection has stimulated a lot of interest in hypothetical rationing strategies for the intensive care unit, none of which has been tested in actual pandemic scenarios.

The clinical effectiveness model of cost containment is an ethical and self-sustaining paradigm that can assist bending the health care-cost curve. As envisioned by Buyx et al, clinically effective care is aimed at making the practice of medicine more explicitly evidence based with the goals of improving clinical success, efficiency, and value.

I illustrate its use with 2 examples from the practice of child neurology: DOC-band (helmet therapy) for the treatment of positional plagiocephaly\u2013relatively inexpensive but ineffective, and adrenocorticotropic hormone for the treatment of infantile spasms\u2013expensive but effective. Introduction Like in any other pluralistic society, Americans\u2019 opinion on a multitude of topics is wide ranging. But the national motto\u2013e pluribus unum\u2013aptly defines our collective attitude toward one challenge\u2013the unsustainable increasing cost of health care. In 2011, health care expenditures in the United States were slightly more than $2.7 trillion, close to 18% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).1 And while we all agree that such figure and the expected continued increase in cos",

Abstract Difficulties in setting healthcare priorities are encountered throughout the world. There is no agreement on the most appropriate principles or methods for healthcare rationing although there is some consensus that it should be undertaken as systematically and accountably as possible. Although some steps towards achieving accountability have been made at the macro and meso level, at the consultation level rationing remains implicit and poorly understood. Using morbid obesity surgery as a case study, we observed a series of UK National Health Service consultations where rationing was ongoing and conducted in-depth interviews with doctors and patients (2011\u20132014). A longitudinal approach was taken to research and in total 22 consultations were observed and 78 interviews were undertaken.

Decision-making is subject to scrutiny by newspaper media, an important public institution and information source for discussions about rationing. In Norway, healthcare rationing has been subject to public debate both before and after the establishment of \u201cThe National System for Managed Introduction of New Health Technologies within the Specialist Health Service\u201d (New Methods) in 2013. Aim To describe and assess the development of the public debate on Norwegian healthcare rationing through three cases in print media. Methods We purposively sampled Norwegian newspaper articles between 2012 and 2018 concerning three reimbursement decisions in the Norwegian system. The reimbursement decisions were ipilimumab (Yervoy, n\u00a0=\u200945) against metastatic melanoma, nivolumab (Opdivo, n\u00a0=\u200923) against non-small cell lung cancer, and nusinersen (Spinraza, n\u00a0=\u200968) against spinal muscular atrophy. Cases were analysed separately using the qualitative method of systematic text condensation. Results Our analysis highlighted four common themes\u2014money, rationales, patient stories, and process\u2014and a unique theme for each case. Ipilimumab was uniquely themed by rationing rejection, nivolumab by healthcare two-tiering, and Spinraza by patients\u2019 rights. We found wide media deliberation among a multitude of stakeholders in all cases. Perceptions of rationing were found to be chiefly aligned with previous empirical research. We found that the media reported more frequently on opposition to rationing compared to findings from previous studies on Norwegian healthcare decision-making attitudes. We think this was influenced by our selection of cases receiv",

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

Understanding Wartime Rationing During times of war, many nations have implemented rationing as a means of conserving resources and ensuring that everyone has access to basic necessities. Understanding wartime rationing is essential, as it can provide valuable insights into how to manage resources during times of crisis. In this section, we will explore the history of wartime rationing, the different types of rationing, and the impact of rationing on society. 1. History of Wartime Rationing: Wartime rationing has been used since ancient times, but it gained prominence during World War I and II. During these wars, governments implemented rationing to conserve resources and ensure that soldiers had enough food and supplies. Rationing continued even after the wars ended, as countries struggled to rebuild their economies. Rationing was also used during the Cold War, as countries feared the possibility of nuclear war. 2. Types of Rationing: There are two main types of rationing: food rationing and non-food rationing. Food rationing involves limiting the amount of food that individuals can purchase or consume. Non-food rationing involves limiting the consumption of other goods, such as gasoline or clothing. Both types of rationing can have a significant impact on society, as they can limit people's access to basic necessities. 3. Impact of Rationing: Rationing can have both positive and negative impacts on society. ",

Exploring the Significance of Wartime Rationing During times of war, nations often face unprecedented challenges, not only on the battlefield but also on the home front. One such challenge that has been prevalent throughout history is wartime rationing. This practice, which involves the controlled distribution of scarce resources, aims to ensure that everyone has access to essential goods during times of scarcity. While wartime rationing may seem like a distant concept from the past, it holds immense significance in understanding the resilience and adaptability of societies during times of crisis. From a historical perspective, wartime rationing has played a vital role in sustaining nations during periods of conflict. It first gained prominence during World War I when countries faced severe shortages of food, fuel, and other essential commodities. Rationing systems were implemented to distribute these limited resources fairly among the population. This approach not only prevented hoarding and price gouging but also ensured that soldiers and civilians alike had access to basic necessities. The success of these rationing programs during World War I laid the foundation for their wider adoption during World War II. 1. ensuring Fair distribution: One of the primary objectives of wartime rationing is to ensure a fair distribution of resources.

Like most Americans during World War II, Oklahomans submitted to a comprehensive system of rationing. Because the United States had experienced wartime inflation during World War I, the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply was established in April 1941 to prevent inflation during World War II. However, the organization had little authority. Consequently, in August 1941 Congress reorganized the agency and changed its name to the Office of Price Administration (OPA). The Emergency Price Control Act of January 1942 increased OPA's powers and authorized it to set ceiling prices on commodities. OPA regulated according to directives from other government agencies such as the War Production Board, War Food Administration, and Petroleum Administration for War. Despite regulation, prices rose, and OPA began rationing scarce consumer goods under the Second War Powers Act (1942). Commodities were allocated first to the armed services and U.S. allies. Civilian allocations were determined once agencies certified amounts available for rationing. OPA administrators Leon Henderson (1941\u201342), Prentiss Brown (1943), and Chester Bowles (1943\u201346) devised the rationing program to equally distribute civilian allocations. OPA employed sixty thousand persons but relied primarily on two hundred thousand volunteers. Rationing was administered on four levels: the national office in Washington, D.C., where policy was formulated and regulations written, nine regional offices (Oklahoma fell within region eight headquartered in Dallas, Texas), approximately ninety-three district offices, and over fifty-six hundred local War Price and Rationing Board offices located in counties throughout the country. Known as local boards, they linked OPA with consumers. Oklahoma County's three original board members were V. P. Crowe, R. J. Clements, and Fred Bailey. OPA developed four methods for rationing, and ration currency included stamps, coupons, toke",

Introduction to Scarcity and Rationing Scarcity is a condition that arises when demand for a good or service exceeds its availability. It is a fundamental economic problem that affects every society, regardless of its level of development. When resources are scarce, rationing becomes necessary to ensure that everyone has access to the goods and services they need to survive. Rationing is the process of allocating a limited amount of a resource to a group of people. It is a tool that is used to manage scarcity and ensure that everyone's basic needs are met. 1. The concept of scarcity Scarcity is a fundamental concept in economics. It refers to the condition in which there are insufficient resources to satisfy the unlimited wants and needs of individuals and society. Scarcity is not just about the availability of goods and services, but also about the availability of time, money, and other resources. In a world of scarcity, individuals and societies must make choices about how to allocate their resources in order to achieve their goals. This is the basis of economic decision-making. 2.

They are the three R's-rationing, restrictions and responsibilities. Recently, a severe shortage of annual influenza vaccine in the US, combined with the threat of pandemic flu, has provided an opportunity for policy makers to think about rationing in very concrete terms. Some lessons from annual flu vaccination likely will apply to pandemic vaccine distribution, but many preparatory decisions must be based on very rough estimates. What ethical principles should guide rationing decisions, what data should inform these decisions, how to revise decisions as new data emerge, and how to implement rationing decisions on the ground are all important considerations. In addition, ethicists might be able to help policy makers think through the importance of international cooperation in surmounting global rationing dilemmas and to accept the inevitable responsibilities of government in making and implementing rationing decisions.

This article explores the concept of rationing, how it works, historical examples, risks associated with it, and its significance in different economic contexts. Understanding rationing Rationing is a critical economic concept involving the controlled distribution of goods and services during times of scarcity. Typically mandated by governments, rationing aims to manage the impact of limited supply and demand imbalances. This article delves into the multifaceted world of rationing, covering its definition, how it functions, historical cases, risks, and its role in various economic systems. What is rationing? Rationing is the systematic allocation of limited resources, goods, or services to ensure their equitable distribution among a population. It is a common approach when the supply of a particular item falls short of the demand, leading to concerns about price surges and inequitable access. Rationing can be initiated at local or federal levels, responding to diverse challenges such as adverse weather conditions, trade restrictions, or, in more extreme scenarios, economic recessions and wars. How rationing works Rationing functions by assigning specific quotas or limits on the amount of a particular item an individual or household can obtain. For instance, individuals may be allotted a certain amount of food per week, or restrictions may be imposed on activities like watering lawns. This controlled distribution impacts the laws of supply and demand, aiming to stabilize prices and ensure that critical goods remain accessible to all.

All rights reserved. Does the Minimum Wage Cause Inefficient Rationing? \u2217 Erzo F.P. Luttmer Abstract By not allowing wages to clear the labor market, the minimum wage could cause workers with low reservation wages to be rationed out while equally skilled workers with higher reserva-tion wages are employed. This paper exploits overlapping CPS panels to more precisely identify those most affected by the minimum wage, a group I refer to as the \u201cunskilled.\u201d I test for inef-ficient rationing by examining whether the reservation wages of employed unskilled workers in states where the 1990-1991 federal minimum wage increase had the largest impact rose relative to reservation wages of unskilled workers in other states. I find that proxies for reservation wages of unskilled workers in high-impact states did not rise relative to reservation wages in other states, suggesting that the increase in the minimum wage did not cause jobs to be allocated less effi-ciently. However, even if rationing is efficient, the minimum wage can still entail other efficiency costs (e.g., from employment reductions).

Login Alert Article contents HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIOUR UNDER RATIONING Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 18 August 2022 Abstract The pandemic-induced economic crisis has seen a massive increase in savings as households could not spend their income. The last time that consumers were seriously rationed was during the Second World War. This article models the behaviour of households during the War years and its immediate aftermath in Ireland, Sweden, the US and UK. Savings were held in liquid form and, once the War was over and rationing eased, a consumption boom transpired. However, significant excess savings were converted into physical assets in the housing market. There is evidence that this pattern is being repeated as the Covid-19 crisis eases. Keywords 1. Introduction During and after the Second World War there was a period of extended rationing in neutral countries, such as Ireland and Sweden, as well as in participants in the conflict, such as the UK and the US. Despite the differences in attitudes of these countries with respect to the War (Harrison, Reference Harrison1998),Footnote 1 consumers were affected in similar ways: real household income rose over the war years in three of these countriesFootnote 2 but consumers were severely restricted in what they could spend their money on. While this regime was in place, whether for precautionary motives, or to postpone expenditure until the goods that households sought became available, there was a major increase in household saving.

Advertisement Framing economic inequality and policy as group disadvantages (versus group advantages) spurs support for action Nature Human Behaviour volume\u00a05,\u00a0pages 349\u2013360 (2021)Cite this article 3040 Accesses 27 Citations 101 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Abstract Given the near-historic levels of economic inequality in the United States, it is vital to understand when and why people are motivated to reduce it. We examine whether the manner in which economic inequality and policy are framed\u2014in terms of either upper-socio-economic-class advantages or lower-socio-economic-class disadvantages\u2014influences individuals\u2019 reactions to inequality. Across five studies, framing redistributive policy (Study 1) as disadvantage-reducing (versus advantage-reducing) and economic inequality (Studies 2\u20135) as lower-class disadvantages (versus upper-class advantages or a control frame) enhances support for action to reduce inequality. Moreover, increased support is partly driven by perceptions that inequality is more unjust if framed as lower-class disadvantages. Using diverse methodologies (for example, social media engagement on Facebook) and nationally representative samples of self-reported upper-class and lower-class individuals, this work suggests that the ways in which economic inequality is communicated (for example, by the media) may reliably influence people\u2019s reactions to and concern for the issue.

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in e",

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable.

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases.

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person.

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Rationing as a Tool for Survival in Times of Scarcity Scarcity: Surviving Scarcity: The Role of Rationing in Times of Need update 1. Understanding the Concept of Scarcity Understanding the Concept of Scarcity is pivotal in grasping the complex dynamics of rationing, especially during times of need. Scarcity, in its essence, refers to the fundamental economic problem of limited resources and unlimited wants. It's a universal dilemma, not confined to a single industry or region. At its core, scarcity dictates that there are insufficient resources to meet the demands and desires of individuals and society as a whole. In this section, we delve deeper into the concept of scarcity, exploring its various dimensions and implications, before embarking on the intricate subject of rationing. 1. Limited Resources, Unlimited Wants: Scarcity arises from the basic fact that our planet has finite resources, such as land, water, and raw materials, but our desires and needs are virtually limitless. This inherent tension creates the need for careful resource allocation. 2. Economic Implications: Scarcity is the cornerstone of economics. It influences choices, prices, and the allocation of resources. For instance, when a resource becomes scarce, its price typically rises as demand outstrips supply. The classic example is the fluctuation in oil prices due to geopolitical tensions. 3. social and Environmen",

The Future of Government Intervention in Rationing Government Intervention: Governing Goods: The Role of Government in Rationing 1. Understanding the Basics of Rationing Rationing is a system of controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services. It is a method used to allocate finite commodities fairly and systematically to avoid the imbalance between demand and supply. Historically, rationing has been employed during times of war, economic crisis, or natural disasters when the demand for essential items far exceeds the supply. The concept of rationing can be traced back to ancient civilizations, but it gained prominence during World War I and II, where governments had to ensure equitable distribution of food, fuel, and other necessities. From an economic standpoint, rationing is seen as a way to manage limited resources efficiently when pricing mechanisms fail to do so. It can prevent inflation in prices and black markets, which often arise from unchecked demand. However, critics argue that rationing can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of innovation, as it may not incentivize producers to increase supply or improve products. 1. Historical Perspective: During World War II, rationing was essential in maintaining home front morale. For example, in the United Kingdom, the government introduced the \"Dig for Victory\" campaign, encouraging citizens to grow their own vegetables to supplement their rations. 2. Economic ",

U.S. Office of Government Ethics Public Servants Can Help Rebuild Trust in Government From: Emory Rounds, Director Recent surveys show that the public\u2019s trust in its government is lower now than it has been at nearly any point in our nation\u2019s recent history. This is deeply troubling. Our fellow Americans\u2019 trust is vital to the success of the public services we provide to them as public servants. Without their trust, it is harder for our government to provide for the health, welfare, safety, and security of our country. To rebuild the trust of our fellow Americans, we must ensure that ethics requirements are not simply treated as administrative, check-the-box exercises, but as vital to building and protecting public trust. Employees, ethics officials, and agency leaders must go beyond mere legal sufficiency and must actively do all they can to foster, enhance, and grow a climate of trust and honorable service. Rebuilding that trust will also require greater transparency. All federal employees must remain aware that we conduct our work in the public eye and must expect public scrutiny. For executive branch leaders, appointed and career, this transparency extends to the contents of our private financial lives. To this end, I call on all filers during this public financial disclosure season to treat this ongoing obligation seriously and to understand that transparency is part of honorable service. Because it is a vital tool for preventing conflicts of interest, public financial disclosure filers in the executive branch can expect, as a matter of near certainty, that the press and civil society will request, receive, and review our financial disclosure ",

Sources: Pew Research Center, National Election Studies, Gallup, ABC/Washington Post, CBS/New York Times, and CNN surveys. When the National Election Study began asking about trust in government in 1958, about three-quarters of Americans trusted the federal government to do the right thing almost always or most of the time. Trust in government began eroding during the 1960s, amid the escalation of the Vietnam War, and the decline continued in the 1970s with the Watergate scandal and worsening economic struggles. Confidence in government recovered in the mid-1980s before falling again in the mid-\u201990s. But as the economy grew in the late 1990s, so too did trust in government. Public trust reached a three-decade high shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks but declined quickly after. Since 2007, the shares saying they can trust the government always or most of the time have not been higher than 30%. Today, 35% of Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents say they trust the federal government just about always or most of the time, compared with 11% of Republicans and Republican leaners. Democrats report slightly more trust in the federal government today than a year ago. Republicans\u2019 views have been relatively unchanged over this period.

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in e",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Introduction to Price Controls and Market Rationing Price controls and market rationing are economic interventions that governments use to manage the availability and affordability of goods and services. These mechanisms are often implemented in situations where market conditions have led to prices that are deemed unacceptable, either because they are too high for consumers to afford or too low to sustain producers. Price controls can take the form of price ceilings, which cap the price of a good or service to prevent it from rising above a certain level, or price floors, which set a minimum price to prevent it from falling below a certain threshold. Market rationing, on the other hand, involves the allocation of scarce resources among various users. It is a way to distribute goods and services when demand outstrips supply, often seen in times of war, natural disasters, or severe economic crises. From an economic standpoint, price controls and rationing can have both positive and negative impacts. On one hand, they can make essential goods more accessible to the population during times of shortage. On the other hand, they can lead to unintended consequences such as black m",

The Future of Government Intervention in Rationing Government Intervention: Governing Goods: The Role of Government in Rationing 1. Understanding the Basics of Rationing Rationing is a system of controlled distribution of scarce resources, goods, or services. It is a method used to allocate finite commodities fairly and systematically to avoid the imbalance between demand and supply. Historically, rationing has been employed during times of war, economic crisis, or natural disasters when the demand for essential items far exceeds the supply. The concept of rationing can be traced back to ancient civilizations, but it gained prominence during World War I and II, where governments had to ensure equitable distribution of food, fuel, and other necessities. From an economic standpoint, rationing is seen as a way to manage limited resources efficiently when pricing mechanisms fail to do so. It can prevent inflation in prices and black markets, which often arise from unchecked demand. However, critics argue that rationing can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of innovation, as it may not incentivize producers to increase supply or improve products. 1. Historical Perspective: During World War II, rationing was essential in maintaining home front morale. For example, in the United Kingdom, the government introduced the \"Dig for Victory\" campaign, encouraging citizens to grow their own vegetables to supplement their rations. 2. Economic ",

Historically, rationing has been a response to ensure equitable distribution during times of war, economic crisis, or natural disasters. It represents a system where the government or a central authority controls the supply of scarce goods, distributing them via a fixed allowance. This method has been pivotal in maintaining stability and preventing market collapse when demand far exceeds supply. From ancient civilizations to modern societies, rationing has taken various forms. In ancient Rome, for instance, grain was rationed to prevent famine among the populace. During World War II, many countries introduced rationing to manage the scarcity of food, fuel, and other essential commodities, ensuring that each citizen received their fair share amidst the strains of global conflict. 1. Ancient Rationing Systems: The earliest records of rationing come from ancient civilizations like Egypt and Babylon, where granaries were used to store and distribute grain in times of famine. 2. Rationing in Wartime: Perhaps the most extensive use of rationing occurred during the World Wars. Governments issued ration books with cou",

This vision is the bedrock of classical liberalism, a political philosophy that championed individual liberty and minimal state interference during a time when feudalism was crumbling. But what does classical liberalism truly entail, and how did it shape modern political thought? Let\u2019s dive into the rich history and core principles of classical liberalism to uncover its enduring influence. The rise of classical liberalism \ud83d\udd17 The emergence of classical liberalism can be traced back to the 17th and 18th centuries, a period marked by significant social, economic, and political upheaval. The decline of feudalism, characterized by rigid hierarchical structures and land-based economies, set the stage for new ideas to take root. As the old order began to disintegrate, thinkers and philosophers started to advocate for a society where individuals could thrive based on their own merits and efforts. Key thinkers of classical liberalism \ud83d\udd17 Several influential thinkers played pivotal roles in shaping classical liberalism. Their ideas laid the foundation for a political philosophy that continues to resonate today. Let\u2019s explore the contributions of John Locke, Adam Smith, and Jeremy Bentham: Core principles of classical liberalism \ud83d\udd17 At its heart, classical liberalism is built on several key principles that collectively champion individual freedom and limited government intervention. Let\u2019s delve into these core tenets: Individual liberty \ud83d\udd17 Central to classical liberalism is the concept of individual liberty. This principle asserts that individuals should have the freedom to make their own choices and pursue their own goals without undue interference from the state or other external forces.

Colonial experiences with British abuses, such as warrantless searches and arbitrary punishments, fueled the desire for explicit personal liberties. James Madison was instrumental in drafting these amendments, responding to public concerns about the new central government's powers. His collaboration with Thomas Jefferson, who believed strongly in individual rights, significantly influenced the final document. The debate wasn't abstract; it was a reaction to lived experiences. Colonists wanted guarantees against potential future abuses by their government. Key figures like George Mason refused to support the Constitution without such promises, leading to the Bill's eventual adoption. Madison, originally skeptical, changed his view in response to public demand. In drafting the amendments, he focused on tangible protections like: Freedom of speech Freedom of religion Freedom of the press Right to a fair trial These freedoms were born out of a specific fear of government overreach, grounded in the colonial struggle for independence. Inspired by philosophers like John Locke and historical documents such as the Magna Carta, the Founders solidified the Amendment's necessity to protect citizens against government tyranny. Core Liberties Guaranteed The Bill of Rights guarantees fundamental individual freedoms essential to the functioning of our republic.

What Exactly is Data Collection? Data collection is the process of collecting, measuring, and analyzing data from various sources to gain insights. Data can be collected through various sources, such as social media monitoring, online tracking, surveys, feedback, etc. In fact, there are three main categories of data that businesses endeavor to collect. 1.\u00a0First-Party Data First-party data is obtained directly from the consumer, through websites, social media platforms, apps, surveys, etc. With rising concerns about privacy, first-party data has become more relevant than ever. It is highly reliable, accurate, and valuable as no mediators are involved. Additionally, since companies have exclusive ownership of first-party data, it can be utilized without restrictions. First-party data helps you analyze the market and customers\u2019 needs. Additionally, this data also has usage restrictions and offers a tailored consumer experience. First-party data refers to customer relationship management data, behavioral data, subscriptions, social media data, customer feedback, consumer purchase data, and survey data. 2.\u00a0Second-Party Data This is data collected from a trusted partner. Here, another business collects the data from consumers and then sells or shares it as part of the partnership. Second-party and first-party data are similar in that they are both collected from reliable sources. Second-party data is used by companies to develop better insights, build better predictive models, and scale their businesses. 3. Third-Party Data Data that are collected from an outside source ",

Introduction: Understanding the Importance of Structured Laboratory Data in R&D Research and Development (R&D) organizations now recognize the increasing significance of structured laboratory data. The days of overflowing binders, labyrinthine shared drives, and intricate spreadsheets are becoming obsolete due to their inability to meet contemporary R&D demands. In this article, we will delve into the role of structured laboratory data in R&D, the shortcomings of traditional data handling methods, and the necessity for innovative data management approaches. II. Traditional Systems Used for Laboratory Data Management \u00e2\u0080\u008dFor decades R&D organizations have relied (many still rely on) heavily on manual methods and systems for data collection and storage. These range from physical lab journals for manual data recording, siloed spreadsheets for data digitization and sorting, shared drives for storing and sharing various digital documents, to even archaic filing cabinets for storing physical notes and data sets.\u00c2\u00a0 It's an odd contrast, to say the least. On one hand, R&D teams are pioneers, pushing the boundaries of discovery and innovation. But on the other hand, they are hampered by archaic, cumbersome, inefficient, and disparate data management systems, which are the antithesis of the innovation they strive to create. Surely, these teams that propel progress should also leverage state-of-the-design technology to fuel their efforts \u00e2\u0080\u0093 an irony that is calling out for resolution! III. Drawbacks of Traditional Data Collection and Management Practices Despite serving R&D organizations for many years, today, traditional methods are inadequate for any R&D organizations that want to modernize and stay competitive. Common challenges that can impact R&D organizations that still implement traditional data management methods include:\u00c2\u00a0 IV. The Importan",

Thus, priority setting and rationing have to be applied. This study aimed at critically examining the concept of rationing in health sector and identifying its purposes, influencing factors, mechanisms, and outcomes. Methods: The critical interpretive synthesis methodology was used in this study. PubMed, Cochrane, and Proquest databases were searched using the related key words to find related documents published between 1970 and 2015. In total, 161 published reports were reviewed and included in the study. Thematic content analysis was applied for data analysis. Results: Health services rationing means restricting the access of some people to useful or potentially useful health services due to budgetary limitation. The inherent features of the health market and health services, limited resources, and unlimited needs necessitate health services rationing. Rationing can be applied in 4 levels: health care policy- makers, health care managers, health care providers, and patients. Health care rationing can be accomplished through fixed budget, benefit package, payment mechanisms, queuing, copayments, and deductibles. Conclusion: This p",

[1], [2], [3], [4]\u00a0Algorithms, powered by predictive analytics, can leverage big data to compute prognoses on a minute-by-minute basis. [1], [5]\u00a0However, designing and using computer programs specifically to provide clinicians with support for clinical decisions in real-time\u2014in the context of scarce medical resources\u2014has ethical implications, which are examined here. Given that computers are free from limitations of human judgment, I argue that, if they are designed specifically to ration care with respect to specified moral and social norms, big data algorithms can promote just allocation of scarce medical resources. \u00a0 Rationing in Medicine Rationing is the allocation of a good in the face of scarcity, meaning that some who want and could benefit from a good will not get it. [6]\u00a0In other words, different parties have an interest in the same scarce resource because each of them will not be as well off without it, yet not everyone can or will receive the scarce resource. Here, I am concerned with the sense of \u201crationing\u201d whereby goods are equitably distributed, though individuals are not guaranteed health care resources in excess of those allocated. [7]\u00a0To ration, then, is to determine the equitable distribution of limited benefits within a society, based on guiding principles and societal values. I will describe a system of rationing, which deprives people of medical care they are owed as\u00a0less just\u00a0or\u00a0less fair\u00a0than it could have been. There are two distinct types of rationing:\u00a0macroallocation\u00a0and\u00a0microallocation. Decisions within the former, affect statistical or hypothetical lives; those within the latter, affect identified lives. Examples of macroallocation include policies on vaccine distribution during an outbreak, rules of priority on transplant waiting lists,",

This has potential to create better results than taking guesses but can also be suboptimal based on misinterpretation of data, unknowns, faulty data, missing data, incorrect models, poorly designed algorithms or a failure to leverage human talents. The following are illustrative examples of a data driven approach. Strategy A data driven strategy looks for hard evidence to support a strategic direction as opposed to a logical argument or intuition. For example, a telecom firm that measures its information technology spending as a percentage of revenue and finds this is higher than the competition may develop a strategy to cut IT costs. This can be compared to logic based strategies with weaker supporting data such as the argument that a firm is building important competitive advantages that will pay off in the long run. Design Data can be used to drive any type of design including architecture, interior design, user interface design, visual design and product design. For example, a firm that buries functions that are used by less than 4% of users deep in a user interface such that they are difficult to find. This can be easily justified with data but may neglect factors such as the possibility these functions are extremely important to the 4% of people who use them and that these users may be influential in some way. Automation Using data to automate work including decisions. For example, a banking website that automatically accepts or rejects applications for a credit card based on consumer credit data. This may have ethical and compliance implications. For example, if data suggests people in a particular zip code are a credit risk a data driven program might simply reject all applications from this area. This may not be judged as fair and reasonable by a society. Marketing Marketing a",

But they aren\u2019t reliable ways to make informed decisions. Following a hunch without using a data-driven approach is often risky. This is especially true in high-stakes decisions at a large organization. A data-driven approach gives you the tools to better understand, verify, and quantify the results of your decisions. In a data-driven organization, you can be more confident about the choices you make. You can steer your organization toward success based on facts, not opinion. What Does \u201cData-Driven\u201d Mean, Exactly? In a data-driven approach, decisions are made based on data instead of intuition. Following a data-driven approach offers measurable advantages. That\u2019s because a data-driven strategy uses facts and hard information rather than gut instinct. Using a data-driven approach makes it easier to be objective about decisions. The results of your data analysis can tell you whether it would be wise to follow a particular course of action. A data-driven strategy involves more than looking at numbers. Many decision-makers base their decisions on theory, instinct, tradition, or a gut feeling. Sometimes, they use a few numbers to back up these decisions. But interpreting those numbers is still a matter of opinion. That\u2019s not the same thing as a data-driven approach. A data-driven strategy is based on collecting and analyzing data. It demands that your organization take a systematic approach. Glancing at the sales numbers or looking over a set of website analytics isn\u2019t enough. Without a systematic approach to analyzing the data, it\u2019s easy to give in to unseen biases or assumptions. Better data leads to better decisions. Making data-driven decis",

Whether it's personnel, budget, or assets, resource allocation can significantly impact operational efficiency. To address this challenge, businesses are turning to data-driven solutions, such as operational intelligence and agile resource allocation, to optimize their resource allocation systems. This article explores how data-driven strategies and operational intelligence can streamline resource allocation for enhanced efficiency. Challenges in Resource Allocation Resource Scarcity and Competition: Impeding Efficient Operations Intelligence Resource allocation, at its core, involves the efficient management of scarce resources. If resources were abundant and unlimited, the intricacies of resource allocation wouldn't be as critical to an organization's success. However, it's imperative to acknowledge that resource allocation isn't solely about managing scarcity; it also encompasses the challenge of limited visibility into how, where, and what these resources are delivering. As organizations expand and diversify, the competition for these finite resources intensifies. This scarcity can result in suboptimal resource allocation, leading to delays and inefficiencies across various facets of business operations. Complexity of Resource Requirements: A Barrier to Streamlining Operations Intelligence Resource requirements can be exceptionally intricate, posing a challenge in accurately allocating resources. This complexity arises from the diverse needs of different departments, projects, and initiatives, often exacerbated by the additional hurdle of departments using disparate tools that don't communicate with each other. This lack of cohesion makes it challenging to achieve a unified view of resource needs, further complicating the resource allocation process. Without the right tools and insights that enable",

At the same time, it is incredibly hard for users to allocate resources per query in the newer breed of Big Data processing systems, and they frequently end up mis-allocating by orders of magnitude. While prior work has focused on predicting peak resource allocation, it misses opportunities for more aggressive resource allocation to trade-off resource sav-ings with query performance. Additionally, these methods fail to predict resource allocations for queries that have not been observed in the past. In this paper, we tackle both these problems. We present a sys-tem for optimal resource allocation in big data systems that can predict performance impact for candidate resource allocations, for both new and past observed queries. We introduce the notion of a performance characteristic curve (PCC) as a parameterized representation that can compactly capture the relationship be-tween resources and performance. To tackle the challenge of training data sparsity, we introduce a novel data augmentation technique to efficiently synthesize the entire PCC using a single run of the query. Lastly, we demonstrate the advantages of a constrained loss function coupled with GNNs, over traditional ML methods, for capturing the domain specific behavior through an extensive experimental evaluation over SCOPE big data work-loads at Microsoft. Our results show that our fast and novel sky-line simulation technique for data augmentation is sufficiently accurate, with a median percentage error in run time estimates of 9% on past jobs and our ML models can estimate the run time o",

Abstract Background Deciding what health services are provided is a key consideration in delivering appropriate and accessible health care for rural and remote populations. Despite residents of rural communities experiencing poorer health outcomes and exhibiting higher health need, workforce shortages and maldistribution mean that rural communities do not have access to the range of services available in metropolitan centres. Where demand exceeds available resources, decisions about resource allocation are required. Methods A qualitative approach enabled the researchers to explore participant perspectives about decisions informing rural physiotherapy service provision. Stakeholder perspectives were obtained through surveys and in-depth interviews. A system theory-case study heuristic provided a framework for exploration across sites within the investigation ar",

Abstract Difficulties in setting healthcare priorities are encountered throughout the world. There is no agreement on the most appropriate principles or methods for healthcare rationing although there is some consensus that it should be undertaken as systematically and accountably as possible. Although some steps towards achieving accountability have been made at the macro and meso level, at the consultation level rationing remains implicit and poorly understood. Using morbid obesity surgery as a case study, we observed a series of UK National Health Service consultations where rationing was ongoing and conducted in-depth interviews with doctors and patients (2011\u20132014). A longitudinal approach was taken to research and in total 22 consultations were observed and 78 interviews were undertaken. Sampling was undertaken purposively and theoretically and analyses were undertaken thematically. Clinicians needed to prioritise 55 patient",

Helen\u00a0Dakin1 \u00b7 Apostolos\u00a0Tsiachristas2,3 Accepted: 14 November 2023 / Published online: 8 February 2024 \u00a9 The Author(s) 2024 Abstract Cost-utility analysis may not be sufficient to support reimbursement decisions when the assessed health intervention requires a large proportion of the healthcare budget or when the monetary healthcare budget is not the only resource constraint. Such cases include joint replacement, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) interventions and settings where all resources are constrained (e.g. post-COVID-19 or in low/middle-income countries). Using literature on health technology assessment, rationing and reimbursement in healthcare, we identified seven alternative frameworks for simultaneous decisions about (dis) investment and proposed modifications to deal with multiple resource constraints. These frameworks comprised constrained optimisation; cost-effectiveness league table; \u2018step-in-the-right-direction\u2019 approach; heuristics based on effective gradients; weighted cost-effectiveness ratios; multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA); and programme budgeting and marginal analysis (PBMA). We used numerical examples to demonstrate how five of these alternative frameworks would operate. The modified frameworks we propose could be used in local commissioning and/or health technology assessment to supplement standard cost-utility analysis for interventions that have large budget impact and/or are subject to additional constraints. Key Points for Decision Makers Cost-utility analysis does not explicitly take account of non-financial healthcare resource constraints that may prevent adoption of cost-effective treatments. We identified seven alternative frameworks for adop-tion and disinvestment of healthcare technologies and propose ways that these could be mod",

This article will delve into the key challenges that organizations face in managing their data, including data quality issues, security concerns, compliance requirements, and scalability limitations. We are all aware that data is the new oil for any organization. Unlocking its value may result in significant opportunities for companies, which is why it is vital to have well-defined plans in place in order to face the most difficult challenges that data management implies. My List of Data Management Challenges 1- Sheer Volume of Data Every day, it is estimated that 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are created, and guess what? The majority of this data is generated by various types of enterprises. As a result, the organization now faces new challenges in terms of obtaining, maintaining, and generating value from data. By effectively managing them, they may gain a better understanding of consumer behavior and market trends, allowing them to make more forceful decisions, enhance processes, improve their marketing campaigns, and optimize products and services. Typically dealing with data introduces challenges such as data categorization, raw data processing, data accuracy, and so on arise. A skilled team equipped with the appropriate tools and technology may assist in controlling and managing the exponential expansion of data created or gathered. The trick is to comprehend the data itself. How is it created? What is it used for? What are its applications? How accurate is the data? Is a single point in time value more essential than a trend value over time? what are the elements of data management? 2- Multiple Data Storages This is one of the most significant challenges that businesses confront.

The Journey from Gridlock to Green Lights The relentless growth of urban populations and the corresponding surge in vehicle ownership have led to an unprecedented strain on city infrastructures, particularly roads. This has resulted in chronic gridlock, a situation where the demand for road space far exceeds its supply, leading to traffic congestion that plagues commuters daily. The traditional approach to tackling this issue has been to expand road capacity or improve public transportation systems. However, these solutions often fall short in addressing the root cause of the problem: the inefficient allocation of road space. As cities grapple with the challenges of urban mobility, a paradigm shift is occurring in how we perceive and manage our streets. Road space rationing, an innovative strategy that complements congestion pricing, is emerging as a promising solution to the gridlock conundrum. By limiting the number of vehicles on the road through various schemes, it aims to optimize the use of existing infrastructure, reduce traffic, and promote sustainable transportation modes.

Future Directions for Fair Resource Rationing Priority Groups: Priority Protocols: Rationing Resources Fairly 1. Ethical Considerations Resource rationing is a critical and often contentious issue, particularly in the context of healthcare, where resources can be scarce and the demand often exceeds supply. The ethical considerations surrounding resource rationing are complex and multifaceted, involving a delicate balance between efficiency, equity, and respect for individual rights. Different ethical frameworks offer varying insights into how resources should be allocated, and these perspectives can sometimes conflict, making the decision-making process even more challenging. From a utilitarian perspective, the focus is on maximizing overall happiness or well-being, which may lead to prioritizing those who could gain the most benefit from the resources. For example, during a pandemic, vaccines might be rationed first to healthcare workers and vulnerable populations, as they are at higher risk and their well-being is crucial to society's functioning. In contrast, a deontological approach would emphasize the importance of equal respect and dignity for all individuals, suggesting that resources should be distributed without regard to the potential outcomes. This might mean allocating resources on a first-come, first-served basis, or through a lottery system, to ensure that no individual is favored over anoth",

Ronaldo - 31 October 2024 - 10:03 am Rationing devices, often perceived as a measure of scarcity and hardship, are actually crucial tools for maintaining social stability and equitable distribution of resources. Understanding why societies need rationing devices goes beyond simple economics; it delves into the complexities of human behavior, resource management, and the pursuit of a just and functioning society. Exploring the Reasons Behind Rationing Rationing devices are implemented for a variety of reasons, all stemming from the fundamental principle of scarcity. Whether it\u2019s wartime shortages, natural disasters, or simply the unequal distribution of essential goods, rationing aims to manage limited resources effectively. When demand outstrips supply, rationing ensures that everyone has at least a basic level of access to what they need. This prevents hoarding, panic buying, and the potential for social unrest. Fairness and Equity in Resource Allocation One of the most compelling reasons for rationing is the pursuit of fairness. In times of crisis, leaving resource allocation to market forces can lead to exorbitant prices that only the wealthy can afford. Rationing, through mechanisms like coupons or quotas, ensures that essential goods are accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. This promotes social cohesion and prevents the widening of existing inequalities. Maintaining Social Order and Preventing Chaos When resources are scarce, competition for them can become fierce. Rationing helps to mitigate this by providing a structured and predictable system for distribution. This can prevent hoarding, black markets, and the potential for violence or social breakdown.

Ethical considerations regarding justice in the healthcare system] Author Affiliation Abstract While economy tries to solve the problem of scarcity by rationing, i.e. increasing efficiency, ethics reflect the path of the just distribution of scarce goods, necessarily including the means of transparent and fair rationing. But how can such rationing be realised in a healthcare system? Non-medical criteria such as the patient's social function or age, though vividly discussed, are inappropriate. Only medical criteria can bring sustainable solutions. The QALY and DALY models are such an attempt. Careful reflection of these measures of quality of life and, in some aspects, accompanying rules to avoid extreme unfairness will be critical to their success.

Abstract Does providing information improve citizens\u2019 perception of government transparency? Does all information matter the same for shaping perceptions about the government? This article addresses these questions in the context of an online randomized survey experiment conducted in Argentina. Results show that providing information to citizens matters for shaping perceptions about transparency, and the content of that information matters for affecting the evaluation people make about the government. Those who received a treatment showing that the government was over-performing on its promises had higher trust in the government than those who received a treatment showing that the government was under-performing. The evidence highlights that the relationship between transparency and trust may be mediated by the performance of the government. Our complementary analytical d",

Jagers 2 Recent reports from climate scientists stress the urgency to implement more ambitious and stringent climate policies to stay below the 1.5 \u00b0C Paris Agreement target. These policies should simultaneously aim to ensure distributional justice throughout the process. A neglected yet potentially effective policy instrument in this context is rationing. However, the political feasibility of rationing, like any climate policy instrument, hinges to a large extent on the general public being suf\ufb01ciently motivated to accept it. This study reports the \ufb01rst cross-country analysis of the public acceptability of rationing as a climate policy instrument by surveying 8654 individuals across \ufb01ve countries\u2014Brazil, Germany, India, South Africa, and the US\u2014on \ufb01ve continents. By comparing the public acceptability of rationing fossil fuels and high climate-impact foods with consumption taxes on these goods, the results reveal that the acceptability of fossil fuel rationing is on par with that of taxation, while food taxation is preferred over rationing across the countries. Respondents in low-and middle-income countries and those expressing a greater concern for climate change express the most favourable attitudes to rationing. As political leaders keep struggling to formulate effective and fair climate policies, these \ufb01ndings encourage a serious political and scienti\ufb01c dialogue about rationing as a means to address climate change and other sustainability-related challenges. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03823-7 OPEN 1 Department of Earth Sciences, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden. 2 Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden. \u2709email: oskar.lindgren@geo.uu.se HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS | (2024) 11:1252 | https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03823-7 1 1234567890():,; Introduction T he formal recognition of the need to transition away from fossil",

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

Ronaldo - 31 October 2024 - 10:03 am Rationing devices, often perceived as a measure of scarcity and hardship, are actually crucial tools for maintaining social stability and equitable distribution of resources. Understanding why societies need rationing devices goes beyond simple economics; it delves into the complexities of human behavior, resource management, and the pursuit of a just and functioning society. Exploring the Reasons Behind Rationing Rationing devices are implemented for a variety of reasons, all stemming from the fundamental principle of scarcity. Whether it\u2019s wartime shortages, natural disasters, or simply the unequal distribution of essential goods, rationing aims to manage limited resources effectively. When demand outstrips supply, rationing ensures that everyone has at least a basic level of access to what they need. This prevents hoarding, panic buying, and the potential for social unrest. Fairness and Equity in Resource Allocation One of the most compelling reasons for rationing is the pursuit of fairness. In times of crisis, leaving resource allocation to market forces can lead to exorbitant prices that only the wealthy can afford. Rationing, through mechanisms like coupons or quotas, ensures that essential goods are accessible to everyone, regardless of their economic status. This promotes social cohesion and prevents the widening of existing inequalities. Maintaining Social Order and Preventing Chaos When resources are scarce, competition for them can become fierce. Rationing helps to mitigate this by providing a structured and predictable system for distribution. This can prevent hoarding, black markets, and the potential for violence or social breakdown.

Rationings Role in Shaping Future Policies Rationing: Rationed Reality: The Necessity and Impact of Rationing in Central Planning 1. A Historical Overview Rationing, as a concept and practice, has been a cornerstone in the architecture of economies facing scarcity of resources or distribution challenges. Historically, rationing has been a response to ensure equitable distribution during times of war, economic crisis, or natural disasters. It represents a system where the government or a central authority controls the supply of scarce goods, distributing them via a fixed allowance. This method has been pivotal in maintaining stability and preventing market collapse when demand far exceeds supply. From ancient civilizations to modern societies, rationing has taken various forms. In ancient Rome, for instance, grain was rationed to prevent famine among the populace. During World War II, many countries introduced rationing to manage the scarcity of food, fuel, and other essential commodities, ensuring that each citizen received their fair share amidst the strains of global conflict. 1. Ancient Rationing Systems: The earliest records of rationing come from ancient civilizations like Egypt and Babylon, where granaries were used to store and distribute grain in times of famine. 2. Rationing in Wartime: Perhaps the most extensive use of rationing occurred during the World Wars. Governments issued ration books with cou",

In the traditional doctor/patient relationship, rationing, the admission that health resources are limited and must be distributed equitably by uni-versally accepted criteria, is essentially ignored.When the physician assumes a popula-tion-based system of ethics to optimize care for all patients within a group, rationing is embraced as the realistic admission that any social action resides within boundaries\u2014 in this case health care resources\u2014and that such restraints have economic consequences that present ethical choices.A common ground to accommodate these dual allegiances is offered by communitarian philosophy, whose outline and applicability is presented here as an alternative to the apparent moral opposition of optimized individual care and the requirement of community-wide distribution of limited health resources.

These policies should simultaneously aim to ensure distributional justice throughout the process. A neglected yet potentially effective policy instrument in this context is rationing. However, the political feasibility of rationing, like any climate policy instrument, hinges to a large extent on the general public being sufficiently motivated to accept it.

Almost 40% of the public say they could accept such measures. These are the findings of new research from the Climate Change Leadership Group at Uppsala University. \"Rationing may seem dramatic, but so is climate change. This may explain why support is rather high. One advantage of rationing is that it can be perceived as fair, if made independent of income. \"Policies perceived as fair often enjoy higher levels of acceptance,\" explains Oskar Lindgren, doctoral student in natural resources and sustainable development at the Department of Earth Sciences at Uppsala University, who led the study, now published in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. To achieve climate targets, policies that effectively reduce consumption with a high climate impact, such as meat and fuel, are needed. At the same time, public acceptance of a particular policy instrument strongly depends on whether it is perceived as fair or not. So far, research in this area has mainly examined economic instruments, such as carbon taxes, while giving little attention to other instruments that could be effective, like rationing. The new study involving nearly 9,000 people in Brazil, India, Germany, South Africa and the United States compares the acceptability of rationing fuel and so-called \"emission-intensive\" food, such as meat, with the acceptability of taxes on the same products. One conclusion is that the acceptability of rationing is on par with the acceptability of taxes. For e",

Part of it was the sheer strangeness of distanced shopping. I had become acutely aware of my physical distance from other people. Soon I noticed them eyeing me from behind their carts with a similar wariness. In the produce section, I hovered a body length or two behind fellow shoppers, waiting for them to bag their bundles of bok choy, unsure how much buffer was considered polite. Nobody wanted to risk the skirmishes over the last rolls of toilet paper we'd seen in videos circulating online; purchasing small cabbages should never be an event that goes viral. Things grew even stranger in the meat section, where paper signs affixed to refrigerated cases told customers they could have only a few pounds of ground beef and pork at a time. Likewise at the milk case. When I finally got to the canned beans section, it was picked clean; my neighbors had apparently decided legumes would get them thro",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design: This is a discussion paper. Methods: A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results: Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \"perfect\" principle to adopt during rationing.

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

The Importance of Fair and Effective Rationing in Scarcity Situations Scarcity: Navigating Scarcity: How Rationing Ensures Fair Distribution 1. Understanding Scarcity and Its Implications Scarcity is a fundamental economic concept that refers to the limited availability of resources in relation to unlimited human wants and needs. This means that there is never enough of anything to satisfy everyone's desires fully. Scarcity is not just a problem in developing countries; it is also a significant challenge in developed economies. The scarcity of resources, whether it is food, water, healthcare, or education, has far-reaching implications for individuals, businesses, and governments. Therefore, it is crucial to understand scarcity and its implications to navigate it effectively. 1. scarcity and Opportunity cost Scarcity implies that choices have to be made, and every choice has an opportunity cost, which is the value of the foregone alternative. For example, if a government decides to invest in building a new highway, the opportunity cost is the foregone investment in education or healthcare. Opportunity cost is a critical concept in decision-making, and it helps individuals and organizations to make informed choices about the best use of their resources. 2. Scarcity and Market Prices Scarcity affects market prices because it influences the supply and demand of goods and services. When a good or service is scarce,",

Pathak Tayfun S\u00a8 onmez M. Utku \u00a8 Unver M. Bumin Yenmez\u2020 July 2020 Abstract COVID-19 has revealed several limitations of existing mechanisms for rationing scarce medical resources under emergency scenarios. Many argue that they abandon various ethical values such as equity by discriminating against disadvantaged communities. Illustrating that these limitations are aggravated by a restrictive choice of mechanism, we formulate pandemic rationing of medical resources as a new application of market design and propose a reserve system as a resolution. We develop a general theory of reserve design, introduce new concepts such as cuto\ufb00equilibria and smart reserves, extend previously-known ones such as sequential reserve matching, and relate these concepts to current debates.

Ethical considerations regarding justice in the healthcare system] Author Affiliation Abstract While economy tries to solve the problem of scarcity by rationing, i.e. increasing efficiency, ethics reflect the path of the just distribution of scarce goods, necessarily including the means of transparent and fair rationing. But how can such rationing be realised in a healthcare system? Non-medical criteria such as the patient's social function or age, though vividly discussed, are inappropriate. Only medical criteria can bring sustainable solutions. The QALY and DALY models are such an attempt. Careful reflection of these measures of quality of life and, in some aspects, accompanying rules to avoid extreme unfairness will be critical to their success.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Justice is required in the enunciation of prioritization criteria, and transparency in its application. In situations of aggravated resource scarcity, it is common to take \u2018allocate\u2019 and \u2018rationing\u2019 as synonyms or claim that \u2018allocate\u2019 is always \u2018rationing\u2019. Rejecting these positions, there is a distinction between 'allocating' (resource management) from 'rationing' (allocation of limited resources to a limited number of persons) and 'rationalizing' (optimization of available resources). These distinctions are ethically pertinent, showing how only 'rationalization' respects justice, transparency and human dignity.

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater equity. A number of countries have attempted to depoliticize decisions on rationing by using health technology assessments and dedicated agencies. Discussion: Resource allocation and rationing differ considerably between the US and Europe. In the US, where social welfare remains controversial, there are few restrictions on the use of health care technology regardless of cost or clinical effectiveness. European countries engage in more explicit debates about these limits, though these are complicated by media and lobby power. 1 Chief Science Officer, Los",

Or is caring for your health a personal choice? Questions like these divide Americans and others around the world about who should receive care. The United States is the only developed country in the world which does not have a 100% answer, but even Americans have limited centralized health care in the form of Medicare and Medicaid at state and national levels. The primary issues of centralized care involve cost. National systems provide basic services for free, which is not guaranteed in the United States. Depending on a person\u2019s insurance situation, they may be subject to a high deductible, co-pays, full prescription costs for name-brand items, and much more. Over 60% of the bankruptcies filed in the U.S. are due to medical costs. There are concerns about a full \u201cMedicare for All\u201d system in the United States as well. Americans don\u2019t like the idea of having the government involved in their personal care decisions. Shifts could disrupt insurance markets and expand wait times for doctors. Here are the pros and cons of centralized health care that the rest of the developed world outside the U.S. has discovered as this debate continues. List of the Pros of Centralized Health Care 1. Centralized health care reduces the overall cost of care for everyone. In 2016, spending in the United States for health care costs rose by 4.3%, reaching a record $3.3 trillion. This cost equates to 17.9% of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the highest in the world today. The average person in the U.S. spends over $10,000 per year on their health care needs. When the U.S. (which does not have centralized care) is compared to the rest of the world, it spends a disproportionate amount on care. Canada spent just $4,752 per person in 2016. The United Kingdom spent $4,192 ",

Rationing involves definition of efficiency (benefit) and equity (fairness) allocation criteria and a recognition of a trade-off between the two. However, accountability for rationing choices also requires careful governance of the agents of society, doctors, who judge the health needs of competing patients. An integrated rationing system requires management of patient access criteria, the knowledge base which informs practice and clinical practices. Introduction The term \u2018rationing\u2019 evokes images of war or crisis in which the limited supply of essentials was distributed, not in accordance with people\u2019s willingness and ability to pay, but in relation to ownership of and willingness to trade a \u2018coupon\u2019 or some other certificate of \u2018right\u2019 to access the market. The economist is concerned with the study of the allocation of scarce resources amongst competing ends. In the health care sector the scarcity of resources means that choices have to be made about who will be given the \u2018right\u2019 of access to care and who, as a result of denial, will be left in pain and discomfort, and, in the limit, to die. In European health care systems, individual governments, reflecting their society\u2019s preference for \u2018solidarity\u2019, have rejected, in large part, giving access to care in relation to willingness to pay and have instead established systems of resource a",

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Christopher Stone January 2010 Introduction When a treatment funding decision is appealed by an individual patient, the law fulness of that decision must be tested for its compliance with UK law , European law or Convention rights. The medical issues that flow from the implementation of the law, while not irrelevant, are often of secondary importance . Consequently, the law can only ensure the fair allocation of healthcare resources in so far as it enforces the fair and reasonable interpretation of the legal framework within which clinical decision makers operate. Deontological reasoning dictates that the extent to which rationing decisions are fair is determined purely by their compliance with the established law, while the consequentialist position , in recognition of the wider ethical dilemma s that face funding authorities, is more pragmatic in the legal defence of those same rationing strategies. It will emerge in the discussion that follows, and from the examination of individual cases, that some rationing strategies are readily defensible because they adhere closely to the principles of distributive justice; such strategies and the funding decisions that they generate are protected by the la w. Conversely, t hose strategies that appear inc onsistent with these principles may be vulnerable in law. The success of a legal challenge to a treatment funding decision under such circumstances is a measure of the extent to which the law maintains equitab le access to healthcare resources by individual patients. Such legal challenges are often celebrated in the media for they strike a cord with the national psyche, sensitive as it is to protecting the rights of NHS patients to the best possible healthcare , free at the point of delivery and according to clinical need . The founding utilitarian principles of the NHS , providing the maximum benefit for the maximum number of patients, were well meant, but as the nation grew older, and healthcare more complex and ",

Anne Scott3\u00a0 58 Accesses Abstract Public discussion of resourcing in healthcare tends to compound ideas of resource allocation and rationing. Public debate also tends to focus on situations of scarcity such as lack of kidneys or hearts for transplantation, or heated arguments regarding whether the latest very expensive new drug should be made available, regardless of cost, to treat certain condition such as cystic fibrosis or a particular type of cancer. The idea that nursing or medical time is an important healthcare resource that needs to be allocated with care rarely gets an effective airing in public debate. I argue in this chapter that it is important in the healthcare context to differentiate resource allocation from rationing, on the basis that if we assume we are rationing healthcare as our starting point we may miss opportunities to examine more and less effective ways of allocating the healthcare resource. This is particularly important in nursing care where failure to examine carefully how the nursing resource is allocated, and supported, is leading to covert rationing of nursing time and suboptimal patient care in hospitals across Europe.

They correctly characterize rationing as an ethical requirement, not a moral abomination. They identify the key health policy question as how rationing can best be done, not whether it should be done at all. They make a cogent defense of what they call \"rationing through inconvenience\" as a justifiable allocational technique. And they wisely call for research on the effectiveness and fairness of this approach and other methods of rationing. I fully agree with their approach to rationing and with their argument that the process they provocatively label \"rationing through inconvenience\" should not be rejected out of hand. But I believe they have underestimated two ways in which the practical impacts of rationing through inconvenience limit its potential usefulness: the asymmetry of its effect on patients and physicians and the way in which it reduces the capacity of health systems to learn from experience. \u00a9 2018 The Hastings Center.

Implementations of command centers and small-scale centralized operating systems have led to improvement in 3 areas: integration of both multiple services into the day-to-day operation, communication and coordination, and employment of prediction and early warning system. Additional studies are required to understand the full impact of command centers on the healthcare system. Copyright \u00a9 2023 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

In Arcadia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Byte-Sized Insights, Jake Hochberg, Vice President of Data Analytics and Chief Analytics Officer at Arcadia, and David Leingang, Director of Program Analytics at Ochsner Health Network, reveal how they use data to optimize its network utilization with the support of a dynamic data platform. In this article, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll cover the development of future insights-driven dashboards, methods Ochsner Health Network employs to analyze healthcare leakage, and how data is the key to optimizing network utilization. What is leakage in healthcare? Leakage in healthcare refers to patients who leave a healthcare provider\u00e2\u0080\u0099s network to seek care elsewhere. This leakage impacts both the continuity of care and the financial stability of healthcare organizations. When patients receive care outside of their primary network, it disrupts the coordination of care, leading to fragmented treatment plans, potential duplication of services, and ultimately, a decrease in the quality of patient care. Patient leakage can be a significant financial burden for healthcare leaders. Revenue loss due to leakage can prevent an organization from investing in new technologies, expanding services, and improving patient care. Addressing this issue is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge, ensuring patient satisfaction, and achieving financial sustainability. How to prevent leakage with healthcare dashboards Most organizations today can use dashboards to show leakage reports. This requires users to filter those reports and pull the data they need out of the dashboard. As the amount of data increases and becomes more complex, users are becoming overwhelmed trying to sift through it all to identify the pieces they need to improve network utilization.

With rising costs and increasing demand for services, healthcare providers face the challenge of maximizing their resources while ensuring quality patient care. You need strategies that not only optimize financial resources but also enhance operational efficiency. By implementing targeted approaches, you can navigate the complexities of resource management. This article explores six key strategies designed to help you allocate resources effectively, ensuring that every dollar spent translates into better patient outcomes. Discover how to streamline processes and improve access to care, ultimately transforming your healthcare organization for the better. Overview of Resource Allocation in Healthcare Effective resource allocation in healthcare stands at the crossroads of necessity and efficiency. With budgets often tighter than a drum, effective use of financial resources can mean the difference between life and death\u2014or, at the very least, between a well-functioning hospital and one scrambling for supplies. You might think of resource allocation as a balancing act, weighing costs against care needs. Hospitals, clinics, and healthcare providers juggle not just money but also human resources, equipment, and time. Each decision they make ripples through patient care pathways, often altering outcomes dramatically. Data plays a huge role in this. An informed approach relies on robust analytics\u2014tracking everything from patient patterns to inventory use. For instance, hospitals use predictive analytics (like fancy math models) to anticipate patient influx during flu season, making sure they don\u2019t run out of those precious nasal swabs. While every healthcare o",

Abstract In the last several decades, the U.S. Health care industry has undergone a massive consolidation process that has resulted in the formation of large delivery networks. However, the integration of these networks into a unified operational system faces several challenges. Strategic problems, such as ensuring access, allocating resources and capacity efficiently, and defining case-mix in a multi-site network, require the correct modeling of network costs, network trade-offs, and operational constraints.

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

Projected shortages of ventilators and beds in hospital intensive care units prompted frameworks for rationing scarce healthcare resources during a public health emergency. These frameworks incorporated several guiding ethical values. Yet, none suggested rationing based on an individual\u2019s ability to pay for care. In the pandemic context, there is widespread agreement that the ability to pay is not an ethically appropriate way to determine who receives care. But, what about under normal circumstances? Acute instances in which demand exceeds a finite supply of a product, such as a ventilator, certainly call for a specialized response. However, while rationing decisions might not always be as stark as the expected ventilator shortage, they consistently occur. Rationing occurs in e",

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Is the day of rationing our nation's health care services on the basis of age close at hand? As the ranks of the elderly swell, and demands on the nation's scarce health care resources increase, the once whispered suggestions that health care should be rationed by age are now growing audible. Currently, about 12% of the population is 65 years or older. By the year 2030, that figure is expected to reach 21%. The fastest growing age group is the population aged 80 and over -- the very segment of the population that tends to require expensive and intensive medical care. The projected demands from a growing elderly population on a health care system that is already taxed to the breaking point, together with continual advances and availability of expensive life-extending technology, have led to troubling questions about society's ability to meet future health care demands, and to the increased tolerance of proposals for rationing. Perhaps the most prominent advocate of aged-based rationing is Daniel Callahan, author of Setting Limits. In this book, Callahan proposed that the government refuse to pay for life-extending medical care for individuals beyond the age of 70 or 80, and only pay for routine care aimed at relieving their pain. Justifying the Limits Those, like Callahan, who support proposals to ration life-extending medical resources on the basis of age maintain that such a rationing system would bring about the greatest good for the greatest number of people.

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

There has been much academic debate, media attention, and conversation in the homes of everyday individuals about the allocation of medical resources, diagnostic testing kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. Yet decisions to prioritize treatment for some individuals over others occur implicitly and explicitly in everyday practices. The pandemic has propelled the socially taboo and unavoidably prickly issue of healthcare rationing into the public spotlight\u2014and as such, healthcare rationing demands ongoing public attention and transparent discussion. This article concludes that in the aftermath of COVID-19, policymakers should work towards normalizing rationing discussions by engaging in transparent and honest debate in the wider community and public domain. Further, injecting greater openness and objectivity into rationing decisions might go some way towards dismantling the societal taboo surrounding rationing in healthcare.

Concurrently, concerns about potential shortages of healthcare professionals and health supplies to address these issues have focused attention on how these resources are ultimately allocated and used. Some strategies, for example, misguidedly use age as an arbitrary criterion that disfavors older adults in resource allocation decisions. This is a companion article to the American Geriatrics Society (AGS) position statement, \"Resource Allocation Strategies and Age-Related Considerations in the COVID-19 Era and Beyond.\" It is intended to inform stakeholders including hospitals, health systems, and policymakers about ethical considerations that should be considered when developing strategies for allocation of scarce resources during an emergency involving older adults.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

While the initial aim of this article was to review the arguments for abandoning the $US50,000 threshold, it quickly turned to questioning whether we should maintain a fixed threshold at all. Our consideration of the relevance of thresholds was framed by two important historical considerations. First, cost-effectiveness analysis was developed for a resource allocation exercise where a threshold would be determined endogenously by maximizing a fixed budget across all possible interventions and not for piecemeal evaluation where a threshold needs to be set exogenously. Second, the foundations of the $US50,000 threshold are highly dubious, so it would be unacceptable merely to adjust for inflation or current clinical practice. Upon consideration of both sides of the argument, we conclude that the arguments for abandoning the concept for maintaining a fixed threshold outweigh those for keeping one. Furthermore, we docum",

The clinical effectiveness model of cost containment is an ethical and self-sustaining paradigm that can assist bending the health care-cost curve. As envisioned by Buyx et al, clinically effective care is aimed at making the practice of medicine more explicitly evidence based with the goals of improving clinical success, efficiency, and value. I provide a vision for applying the clinical effectiveness model to the American health care system. I illustrate its use with 2 examples from the practice of child neurology: DOC-band (helmet therapy) for the treatment of positional plagiocephaly\u2013relatively inexpensive but ineffective, and adrenocorticotropic hormone for the treatment of infantile spasms\u2013expensive but effective. Introduction Like in any other pluralistic society, Americans\u2019 opinion on a multitude of topics is wide ranging. But the national motto\u2013e pluribus unum\u2013aptly defines our collective attitude toward one challenge\u2013the unsustainable increasing cost of health care. In 2011, health care expenditures in the United States were slightly more than $2.7 trillion, close to 18% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP).1 And while we all agree that such figure and the expected continued increase in cos",

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

Affiliations Rationing of health care: is there an economic rationality to it? Author Affiliations Abstract The point of departure of this Editorial is the fact that we all are engaged in self-rationing in our everyday lives. We would like to spend more money on all sorts of nice things and devote more time to our cherished activities. Imposed rationing is characteristic of wartime governments, who seek to prevent the rich from gobbling up the resources left by the army. Since the publication in 1987 of David Callahan's Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society (Callahan, Setting limits: medical goals in an aging society, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987), rationing of health care has become a widely debated issue (the Internet is full of pertinent entries). While rationing has also been addressed by health economists, there are three puzzling observations. First, Callahan (Callahan, Setting limits: medical goals in an aging society, Simon & Schuster, New York, 1987) wrote for an American audience whereas rationing was introduced by the British National Health Service (NHS) well before 1987, with little debate. Second, the economic theory of rationing had been laid out by James Tobin [Ectrica 20(4): 521-533, 1952] as early as 1952--but health economists seem to have neglected his groundwork when writing about rationing.

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases. Concrete and pragmatic regulations and guidelines for systematic rationing have to be framed and followed. In addition, physicians being sensitive and empowered on deciding bedside rationing in coordination with the recommendations of ethicists and healthcare officials, will ensure fair practice.

This article provides and update of the arguments that justify public intervention in health, and emphasizes the failures of the private insurance market that call for mandatory universal health insurance, although that does not necessarily mean that state has to be the insurer. The relationship between both sectors and the variables determining the relative level of expenditure in both are also analyzed. Following the literature on the public provision of private goods, the level of expenditure in a democracy is seen to depend on the preferences of the median voter, where private insurance usually tops up public insurance. The key variable determining the decision to buy additional private insurance is the difference in quality, defined broadly, between both sectors. Concerning policies, the appropriateness of fiscal incentives to promote the uptake of private insurance is discussed and it is concluded that there is no clear evidence of its suitability. Also, it is argued that models in which the public and private sectors appear totally segregated or totally integra",

MICHAEL SUPANICK I. BACKGROUND: THE CURRENT LANDSCAPE OF AMERICAN HEALTHCARE AND INSURANCE Healthcare reforms dominated the Presidential debates leading up to the 2020 election. The flawed United States healthcare system has many problems, especially surrounding insurance coverage. As a result, a majority of Americans favor the implementation of a universal healthcare system.1 However, the population is also hesitant to rid the system of private insurance altogether.2 In response, this paper will analyze the current shortfalls of the American health insurance model, how other countries utilize private insurance in universal healthcare systems, and the best solution for doing the same in the United States. A. THE AMERICAN HEALTH INSURANCE MODEL The United States uses a mix of private and public health insurance with the burden of coverage being shared between the government, employers, and individuals.3 Americans can get private health insurance through employers or by buying it directly.4 Others receive public insurance through Medicaid5 or the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d).6 Additionally, Medicare provides coverage for elderly individuals.7 Medicare is unique in that it provides public coverage but still maintains a significant role for private insurance.8 1 Matthew Sheffield, Poll: Most Americans Want Universal Healthcare but Don\u2019t Want to Abolish Private Insurance, HILL (Feb. 7, 2019), https://thehill.com/hilltv/what-americas-thinking/428958-poll-voters-want-the-government-to-provide-healthcare-for. 2 Id. 3 Roosa Tikkanen et al., International Health Care System Profiles: United States, COMMONWEALTH FUND, (June 5, 2020), https://international.commonwealthfund.org/countries/united_states. 4 Id. 5 Id. 6 VA Health Care, U.S. DEP\u2019T VETERANS AFFS., https://www.va.gov/health-care (last updated Oct. 30, 2020). 7 Tikkanen et ",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

Abstract This study confirms that local government competition is an important influencing factor on resource allocation efficiency. The results indicate that local government competition can inspire local governments to better serve local businesses and residents, improve administrative efficiency, reduce unnecessary administrative barriers, and encourage the government to allocate resources more efficiently. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis results show that the promotion effect of local government competition on resource allocation is more pronounced in areas with lower marketization and in private enterprises. Overall, the results of this study indirectly confirm that building a \"proactive government\" can optimize the resource allocation efficiency. Introduction Since China's reform and opening up policy, the dual incentive mechanisms of fiscal decentralization and official promotion have triggered intense competition among local governments. While this competition has driven China's rapid economic growth, it has also led to the phenomenon of market segmentation.

(PDF-2 MB) In the private sector, the best-managed companies often review their finances strategically, make tough decisions about investments, and reallocate resources quickly. As a result, they tend to generate significantly higher shareholder returns than their counterparts do: companies that dynamically reallocate their resources to higher-value activities or investments deliver, on average, a 10 percent return to shareholders; those that allocate more slowly or not at all, only 6 percent.

But it is a complex landscape to navigate, and senior officials around the world grapple with challenges such as limited resources, competing policy priorities and economic uncertainty. In emerging or fragile countries, this can be compounded by a range of additional factors. These include establishing a robust financial infrastructure, managing rapid economic changes, fostering sustainable growth while addressing disparities, and managing the effects of conflict. Regardless of country context, successful service delivery, financial stability and citizen well being depend on effective budget management.\u00a0 Building a Budget in Government The foundation of effective budget planning begins with in-depth analysis of economic indicators. These statistical metrics help to evaluate various aspects of an economy\u2019s performance, providing insights into the overall health, trends, and stability of an economy. Common economic indicators include: Economic indicators play a crucial role in budget planning for several reasons: However, economic indicators are only part of the picture: governments also need to balance diverse stakeholder interests. Diverse perspectives bring a wealth of insights and ideas to the table, enriching the decision-making process. Incorporating various viewpoints ensures a more comprehensive understanding of the potential impacts of budgetary decisions. Different stakeholders often have divergent priorities and preferences. For instance, while business groups may advocate for tax cuts, social welfare organizations may emphasize increased spending on public services. And diverse stakeholder groups may have unique insights into the needs of specific communities or sectors. This can be further complicated by political motivations, as government offic",

It was primarily intended to protect newly freed African Americans in the South from discriminatory state actions. Congressman John A. Bingham and Senator Jacob Howard were key figures in including these protections. The framers aimed to solidify the gains of emancipation within the Constitution, safeguarding civil rights against state abuses. However, the phrase \"equal protection\" was subject to various interpretations even among its supporters. It's unclear whether they envisioned a broad standard applying to various classifications or focused solely on racial equality. Early Court interpretations leaned towards racial protection, but the language wasn't explicitly racial. Over time, it became a universal protector against unequally applied legislation. Evolution of Equal Protection Interpretation Initial focus: Racial protection Early testing ground: Economic regulation Non-suspect classifications: Rational basis review Target: State governments, not private individuals Cases like Reitman v. Mulkey highlighted the nuance of state involvement, striking down a state constitutional amendment encouraging discrimination in private housing. Not all classifications by law amounted to unequal protection. Legislatures retained broad leeway in differentiating among people and scenarios. Only classifications without rational basis or rooted in invidious discrimination were found unconstitutional. The evolution of the Equal Protection Clause reflects the balance between federal oversight and states' autonomy, from its origins to its broad application today.

Despite this, there is a divergence between what different actors in all arenas mean by 'justice and equity'. Meanwhile, the extent to which allocation research has worked to empirically assess and operationalize concepts of equity and justice in practice remains unclear. This study examines how justice and equity are defined and understood within water resources allocation research. It also examines how extensively they are assessed in the allocation literature. We discuss equity/justice from diverse perspectives. We focus on the diversity of societal values related to water resource equitability and the typology of equity factors in water resource allocation. Our argument is that water allocations should be multi-processed to ensure water equitability by analyzing feedback and co-evolving processes and scenarios among economic justice, distributional justice, environmental justice, and institutional justice. We find that the literature has paid more attention to certain aspects of justice (e.g., distributive and procedural justice concerns) on certain topics, such as water resources management and allocation. In order to address this research gap, we call for a multi-scale and holistic approach to justice/equity issues. This i",

Mitchell It is a well-established legal principle that liability for deprivation of civil rights pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 is generally reserved for public entities acting under color of state law. This statute does not typically apply to impose liability on private entities acting in a non-governmental capacity. The lines can become blurred, however, when a private entity enters a contract with a public body. Both the scope of the contract and actual actions of the private entity require careful scrutiny to avoid creating an exposure that does not otherwise exist. Risks for Private Entities In order to prevail on a claim under Section 1983, a plaintiff must establish \u201cthe violation of a right secured by the Constitution and laws of the United States,\u201d and must show that the alleged deprivation was \u201ccommitted by a person acting under color of state law.\u201d\u00a0West v. Atkins, 487 U.S. 42, 48; 108 S.Ct. 2250 (1988). Generally, a private entity is not considered a \u201cstate actor,\u201d nor does it proceed \u201cunder color of state law.\u201d This, however, is not always the case. Our firm recently achieved the dismissal of a case against a private entity alleged to be subject to Sec. 1983 exposure due to its performance of a contract with a public entity. The Sixth Circuit recognizes three tests for determining whether a private entity is subject to Sec. 1983 exposure due to its association with a public body.\u00a0See Memphis, TN Area Local American Postal Workers Union v. Memphis, 361 F.3d 898 (6th Cir. 2004). The first is the public function test. This requires the private entity to exercise powers that are traditionally reserved to the state. For example, a contract that expressly delegates the functions of a state actor to a private entity, with that entity actually performing those functions, would likely create exposure. The second is the state compulsion test. This",

Using a total benefit-maximizing approach may not be applicable while distributing resources among entities, and hence we propose a novel structure for integrating balance into the allocation process. In the proposed approach, imbalance is defined and measured as the deviation from a reference distribution determined by the decision-maker. What is considered balanced by the decision-maker might change with respect to the level of total output distributed. To provide an allocation policy that is in line with this changing structure of balance, we allow the decision-maker to change her reference distribution depending on the total amount of output (benefit). We illustrate our approach using a project portfolio selection problem. We formulate mixed integer mathematical programming models for the problem with maximizing total benefit and minimizing imbalance objectives. The bi-objective models are solved with both the epsilon-constraint method and an interactive algorithm. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

Some examples include increasing student access to higher education and helping to care for the economically disadvantaged by funding nutrition programs and housing assistance. Recently, grants have also provided a key tool for responding to the health and economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and rebuilding the country's infrastructure. Federal grants represent a substantial financial commitment. In fiscal year 2022, federal aid to tribal, state, local, and territorial governments\u2014primarily through grants\u2014was $1.2 trillion. GAO has reviewed numerous aspects of federal grants management spanning several decades. A number of common themes have arisen from GAO's work and contribute to observations on long-standing challenges. This statement is based on GAO's prior reports and testimony related to its body of work on federal grant management and focuses on long-standing challenges in the areas of capacity, streamlining, transparency, and internal control and oversight.

Abstract This study confirms that local government competition is an important influencing factor on resource allocation efficiency. The results indicate that local government competition can inspire local governments to better serve local businesses and residents, improve administrative efficiency, reduce unnecessary administrative barriers, and encourage the government to allocate resources more efficiently. Moreover, the heterogeneity analysis results show that the promotion effect of local government competition on resource allocation is more pronounced in areas with lower marketization and in private enterprises. Overall, the results of this study indirectly confirm that building a \"proactive government\" can optimize the resource allocation efficiency. Introduction Since China's reform and opening up policy, the dual incentive mechanisms of fiscal decentralization and official promotion have triggered intense competition among local governments. While this competition has driven China's rapid economic growth, it has also led to the phenomenon of market segmentation.

We testified that Congress and agencies could take 112 new actions to address these findings\u2014like changing how agencies buy goods and services to save money. Agencies have made significant progress in addressing many of the over 1,100 actions we identified in the past decade. We estimate at least tens of billions of dollars in financial benefits have resulted since May 2020. Addressing all remaining actions could save tens of billions more dollars. We'll update total financial benefits in fall 2021. Highlights What GAO Found GAO\u2019s 2021 annual report identifies 112 new actions for Congress or executive branch agencies to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of government. For example: From 2011 to 2021, GAO has identified more than 1,100 actions to reduce costs, increase revenues, and improve agencies' operating effectiveness. GAO\u2019s last report in May 2020 said progress made in addressing many of the actions identified from 2011 to 2019 had resulted in approximately $429 billion in financial benefits, including $393 billion that accrued through 2019 and $36 billion that was projected to accrue in future years. Since May 2020, at least tens of billions of dollars in additional financial benefits have been achieved.

Deregulations Role in Shaping Modern Capitalism Deregulation: Deregulation and Its Impact on Capitalist Dynamics 1. The Genesis of Deregulation The move towards deregulation has been a defining feature of economic policy in many capitalist economies over the past few decades. This shift has been driven by a belief in the power of market forces to allocate resources more efficiently than government intervention. Proponents argue that reducing government control can lead to a more dynamic and innovative economy, while critics caution against the potential for increased inequality and market instability. From an economic perspective, deregulation is often seen as a way to reduce costs and increase competition. By removing barriers to entry, new firms can enter the market, which can drive innovation and lower prices for consumers. For example, the deregulation of the airline industry in the United States in 1978 led to increased competition and a wider range of choices for consumers. However, from a social perspective, deregulation can have mixed effects. While it may lead to lower prices and more choices, it can also result in job losses and a reduction in services, particularly in rural or underserved areas. Additionally, the removal of regulations designed to protect workers, consumers, or the environment can have significant negative consequences. From a political standpoint, deregulation can be a contentious issue. It often involves a trade-off between ",

AccountingInsights Team Published Jul 18, 2024 Deregulation, the process of reducing or eliminating government oversight in specific industries, has been a pivotal force shaping modern economies. Its proponents argue that it fosters competition, drives innovation, and lowers consumer prices, while critics warn of potential market failures and reduced protections for consumers and workers. Understanding the economic impact of deregulation requires examining its principles, historical context, and real-world outcomes. Key Principles of Deregulation in Economics At its core, deregulation is driven by the belief that markets function more efficiently when free from excessive government intervention. This philosophy is rooted in classical economic theories that advocate for minimal state interference, positing that the invisible hand of the market is the best mechanism for resource allocation. By removing regulatory constraints, businesses are thought to operate more freely, fostering an environment where competition can thrive. One of the foundational principles of deregulation is the reduction of barriers to entry. Regulations often create significant hurdles for new firms attempting to enter a market, which can stifle competition and innovation. By lowering these barriers, deregulation aims to create a more dynamic market landscape where new entrants can challenge established players, potentially leading to better products and services for consumers. Another principle is",

The regulation of interest rate ceilings was argued to have two effects - lower saving and a misallocation of capital. Because interest rate ceilings mean that financial intermediaries must ration credit, there are consequences for the types of projects that are funded within the economy. There is no reason to assume that the allocation process of financial intermediaries will be socially optimal, and it is likely that there will be a bias against risky projects with high expected returns. Such a misallocation may affect the level and growth of income. Amongst the objectives of financial market deregulation expressed in the Campbell Committee Report was the improvement of the allocative efficiency of the Australian economy. Allocative efficiency requires the level of real interest rates to be in line with the marginal productivity of capital, while nominal interest rates should vary with changes in expected inflation. Therefore, removal of interest rate controls should have improved the allocative efficiency of the financial system. If there has been an improved allocation of capital, this should have increased the productivity with which resources are used, leading to increases in output. A formal assessment of the allocative efficiency outcome for the post deregulation period is made from the estimation of an aggregate production function for the Australian economy, in which",

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Using a total benefit-maximizing approach may not be applicable while distributing resources among entities, and hence we propose a novel structure for integrating balance into the allocation process. In the proposed approach, imbalance is defined and measured as the deviation from a reference distribution determined by the decision-maker. What is considered balanced by the decision-maker might change with respect to the level of total output distributed. To provide an allocation policy that is in line with this changing structure of balance, we allow the decision-maker to change her reference distribution depending on the total amount of output (benefit).

A government seeks to allocate limited resources to productive sectors, but sectoral productivity is privately known by agents with vested interests in those sectors. They lobby the government for preferential treatment. The government\u2014even if it hon-estly seeks to maximize economic ef\ufb01ciency\u2014may be confounded by the possibility that both high wealth and true economic desirability create loud lobbies. Broadly speaking, both poorer economies and unequal economies display greater public misallocation. The paper warns against the conventional wisdom that this is so because such governments are more \u201ccorrupt.\u201d (JEL D72, D78, D82, O16) In this paper we propose a particular channel through which wealth inequality distorts the resource allocation process. Our analysis rests on four premises: 1. Governments play a role in the allocation of resources. They can facilitate (or hinder) economic activity in certain geographic re-gions or in certain sectors by the use of subsidies, tax breaks, infrastructural alloca-tion, preferential credit treatment, and per-missions or licenses. 2. Governments lack information\u2014just as pri-vate agents do\u2014regarding which sectors are worth pushing in the interests of economic ef\ufb01ciency. 3. Agents lobby the government for preferen-tial treatment. Moreover, lobbying some-times, but certainly not always, entails bribery of corrupt government bureaucrats. It involves industrial confederations, proces-sions, demonstrations, signature campaigns, media manipulation, and a host of other vis-ible means to demonstrate that preferential treatment to some group will ultimately ben-e\ufb01t \u201csociety\u201d at large. 4.

Well, the fact of the matter is that resources are limited. No society has a bottomless well of resources available to them, therefore, there must be a system created to know what and how much to produce and how to distribute it all. To learn how to allocate resources, types of resource allocation, and more, read on! Millions of flashcards designed to help you ace your studies There are three questions that are asked to determine how to allocate resources:What products and services should be produced? How will such products and services be produced? Who will get to have these goods and services? In a market economy, the government has quite a limited role to play. What is NOT a question you would ask yourself if you were building a house and had to allocate your resources accordingly? Which are examples of one-time resource allocations? Your firm has to produce 15,000 cars annually so that the government will renew your business permits. What type of economy do you most likely live in?

AccountingInsights Team Published Oct 21, 2024 Fund accounting is a specialized system used by governmental and nonprofit organizations to ensure accountability and transparency in financial management. Unlike traditional business accounting, fund accounting focuses on tracking resources restricted for specific purposes, which is essential for these entities as they often manage public funds or donations with stipulations attached. Fund Accounting Principles At the core of fund accounting is the principle of accountability, which requires organizations to track and report on the use of resources meticulously. This is achieved through the establishment of distinct funds, each representing a self-balancing set of accounts. These funds segregate financial resources according to their intended purpose, ensuring that money allocated for specific projects or activities is used appropriately. This separation is not only a matter of internal control but also a requirement for compliance with legal and donor-imposed restrictions. The concept of fund balance is another key aspect of fund accounting. It represents the net resources available within a fund after accounting for liabilities. Fund balances are categorized into classifications such as nonspendable, restricted, committed, assigned, and unassigned, each indicating the degree of constraint on the use of resources. For instance, restricted fund balances are subject to externally imposed limitations, while committed funds are con",

Introduction Brief Overview of Fund Accounting in Government Entities In this article, we\u2019ll cover governmental funds vs proprietary funds vs fiduciary funds. Fund accounting is a specialized accounting system used by government entities to ensure accountability and proper tracking of the sources and uses of public funds. Unlike private sector accounting, which focuses primarily on profitability, fund accounting emphasizes accountability to public stakeholders. This system segregates financial resources into specific funds according to their intended purpose, governed by laws and regulations. Each fund operates like a separate entity with its own set of financial statements, ensuring that money allocated for a specific purpose is used only for that purpose. In fund accounting, government finances are categorized into various funds based on the activities they support, the sources of funding, and the rules that apply to their use. This categorization allows government entities to manage and monitor resources more effectively, ensuring transparency and adherence to legal and financial policies. Importance of Distinguishing Between Different Types of Funds Understanding and distinguishing between different types of funds within government accounting is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps in ensuring legal compliance, as each fund has its own set of rules regarding how money can be raised and spent. Misclassification of funds can lead to misuse of resources, legal penalties, and loss of public trust. Secondly, differentiating fund types aids in effective financial reporting and decision-making. Stakeholders, including taxpayers, government officials, and financial analysts, rely",

However, this may not be possible during a pandemic , whe n health resources are likely to be limited . Setting priorities and rationing resources in this context means making tragic choices, but these tragic choices can be ethically justified. This is why we have ethics. This policy brief answers a number of questions about the ethics of setting priorities for the allocation of resources during times of scarcity. Such decisions may include access to hospitals, ventilators, vaccines and medicines. It is essential that polic ies and practice s are ethically justified in such contexts . The document provides a high -level ethical framework that can be used to guide decision -making , and complements WHO\u2019s technical guidance . Can I adapt previous framework s for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID -19? Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet , when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic . That is, w hile the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions , given contextual circumstances . For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources duri ng COVID -19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut -offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years . When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation , we should consider the extent t o which ",

Forfeiture statutes are now prevalent throughout the federal legal code and their use, along with other important anti-crime measures, has had a significant impact on crime. One of the most important provisions of asset forfeiture is the authorization to share federal forfeiture proceeds with cooperating state and local law enforcement agencies. The Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Program serves not only to deter crime but also to provide valuable additional resources to state and local law enforcement agencies. As this is written, the Department of Justice has shared over $4.5 billion in forfeited assets with more than 8,000 state and local law enforcement agencies. A Guide to Equitable Sharing for State and Local Law Enforcement Agencies serves to promote and maintain the integrity of the equitable sharing program so that it can continue to merit public confidence and support. For this reason it is supplemented with the National Code of Professional Conduct for Asset Forfeiture (see Appendix B). All seizing and prosecutorial agencies should ensure compliance with this Code. Most importantly, this Guide seeks to assist state and local law enforcement agencies participating in the program by clarifying the directives they must follow to obtain and use equitably shared funds. The goal is to make the process as clear as possible so that local communities and the nation can thrive from reduced crime and from quality law enforcement.

Federal agencies, guided by the Office of Management and Budget are now busy implementing the executive order which includes conducting agency-wide equity assessments and developing plans to address equity barriers. Based on Third Sector's experience providing technical assistance, training, coaching, and thought partnership to over 50 state and county-level government agencies working to improve outcomes for historically marginalized and excluded populations, we offer a framework, for how federal (as well as state and local agencies) can assess and reorient their systems to achieve improved and equitable outcomes. This framework involves two guiding principles and six \"building blocks\" that collectively determine how opportunities and benefits reach people. Achieving an equitable distribution of opportunities and benefits means embracing the principles while taking concrete action within each building block. The guiding principles include acknowledging past harm and centering end-users. The building blocks include internal culture, external relationships, data, services & technical assistance, policy, and funding.

However, this may not be possible during a pandemic, when health resources are likely to be limited. Setting priorities and rationing resources in this context means making tragic choices, but these tragic choices can be ethically justified. This is why we have ethics. This policy brief answers a number of questions about the ethics of setting priorities for the allocation of resources during times of scarcity. Such decisions may include access to hospitals, ventilators, vaccines and medicines. It is essential that policies and practices are ethically justified in such contexts. The document provides a high-level ethical framework that can be used to guide decision-making, and complements WHO\u2019s technical guidance. 1. Can I adapt previous frameworks for pandemic influenza to guide resource allocation for COVID-19? Many ethical frameworks have been produced for resource allocation, some of which have been included in pandemic plans. Those frameworks provide useful guidance in the current scenario. Yet, when applying them, we must take into account the type of health care resource, the context, and the stage of the pandemic. That is, while the ethical principles that apply to resource allocation might be the same in different pandemics, they can lead to different decisions, given contextual circumstances. For example, this pandemic appears to significantly impact older adults (those 60 years of age or older), and such characteristics are relevant to shaping priorities for the allocation of resources during COVID-19. As a result, it may be inappropriate to use critical care triage guidelines that have age cut-offs that deprioritize or exclude those aged over 60 years. When applying ethical guidelines for resource allocation, we should consider the extent to which resources are overwhelm",

Wolf, JD from the University of Minnesota Consortium on Law and Values in Health, Environment & the Life Sciences. Introduction Minnesota is working diligently to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, i.e., one to which humans do not have pre-existing immunity. It causes COVID-19, a disease that is spreading globally and can cause serious illness and death. This pandemic has overwhelmed health care systems in many countries, necessitating rationing of a variety of health care resources, including diagnostic tests, intensive care resources such as mechanical ventilators, and blood products. There are efforts underway in Minnesota to slow the spread of the illness, increase supplies of needed resources, and develop new therapies for COVID-19. Although everyone hopes that these efforts will prevent a surge of cases in which need for health resources exceeds supply, we must plan for the possibility that rationing will be necessary. To develop ethical guidance for the allocation of scarce health resources during this public health crisis, faculty from the University of Minnesota joined with the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH), State Health Care Coordination Center (SHCCC), and Minnesota Hospital Association to convene a statewide Minnesota COVID Ethics Collaborative (MCEC). This multidisciplinary group includes members from multiple health care institutions across Minnesota and incorporates experts in ethics, law, public health, medicine, nursing, disaster planning, and spiritual care. The goal is to rapidly share expertise and support the development of sound policies and procedures to address the ethical challenges posed by the COVID-19 crisis, such as allocation of scarce medical reso",

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Finally, we aim to foster an organizational and management culture that supports staff in bringing their full selves and unique perspectives to our work. This includes training managers to bring cultural humility to our management practices. How We Do Our Work We incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion in our core work in the field. We are developing tools and solutions that help our staff and government partners integrate a DEI lens across all the stages of service delivery improvement, with a focus on supporting governments in identifying and addressing disparity and disproportionality in resource allocation, service delivery, and service outcomes. By collaborating with governments to develop and demonstrate solutions, we hope to contribute to efforts to re-engineer more just and equitable social service systems. This might look like: We strive to reflect considerations of equity by incorporating historically marginalized or vulnerable populations' views an",

Abstract We aim to design a fairness-aware allocation approach to maximize the geographical diversity and avoid unfairness in the sense of demographic disparity. During the development of this work, the COVID-19 pandemic is still spreading in the U.S. and other parts of the world on large scale. Many poor communities and minority groups are much more vulnerable than the rest. To provide sufficient vaccine and medical resources to all residents and effectively stop the further spreading of the pandemic, the average medical resources per capita of a community should be independent of the community's demographic features but only conditional on the exposure rate to the",

Advancing Expenditure Equity for a Just Society Expenditure Equity: How to Ensure the Fair and Just Distribution of Public Resources and Benefits 1. Understanding Expenditure Equity In the complex landscape of public finance and resource allocation, the concept of expenditure equity stands as a critical pillar. It transcends mere financial transactions; it embodies the principles of fairness, justice, and societal well-being. In this section, we delve into the multifaceted dimensions of expenditure equity, exploring its significance, challenges, and potential solutions. 1. The Essence of Expenditure Equity - From a social Justice perspective: Expenditure equity is rooted in the belief that public resources should be distributed in a manner that minimizes disparities and promotes social justice. It acknowledges that different segments of society have varying needs and vulnerabilities. For instance, allocating more funds to education in economically disadvantaged areas ensures that every child has an equal chance to thrive. - Economic Efficiency Considerations: Beyond moral imperatives, expenditure equity also intersects with economic efficiency. When resources are allocated efficiently, overall societal welfare improves. For instance, investing in preventive healthcare reduces long-term costs by aver",

However, the Institute of Economics and Peace (IEP) envisions it much more broadly, defining peace not just by the absence of violence or fear (negative peace), but also by the presence of structures and systems that create and sustain peaceful societies (positive peace). This more holistic concept of peace is organized around the \"8 Pillars of Positive Peace\", one of which is the \"Equitable Distribution of Resources\". Share ARAC International What is the Equitable Distribution of Resources? The Equitable Distribution of Resources refers to the fair allocation of resources such as wealth, healthcare, education, and opportunities across all segments of society, irrespective of gender, race, social status, or any other differentiating factor. This is not to be confused with equal distribution, which means everyone gets the same amount. Instead, it\u2019s about fairness, ensuring everyone can access the resources they need to thrive. Why is it Important? A society marked by gross inequality can lead to social tension, resentment, and conflict. Conversely, when resources are distributed equitably, it leads to a reduction in grievances among marginalized gr",

Published online: April 13, 2016. There has been much discussion of resource allocation in medical systems, in the United States and elsewhere. In large part, the discussion is driven by rising costs and the resulting budget pressures felt by publicly funded systems and by both public and private components of mixed health systems. In some publicly funded systems, resource allocation is a pressing issue because resources expended on one disease or person cannot be spent on another disease or person.

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality.

(PDF-2 MB) In the private sector, the best-managed companies often review their finances strategically, make tough decisions about investments, and reallocate resources quickly. As a result, they tend to generate significantly higher shareholder returns than their counterparts do: companies that dynamically reallocate their resources to higher-value activities or investments deliver, on average, a 10 percent return to shareholders; those that allocate more slowly or not at all, only 6 percent. Stay current on your favorite topics Subscribe In the public sector, however, a McKinsey Center for Government analysis finds little change in spending allocations from year to year. Although some governments have successfully reallocated resources\u2014as Chile, for example, did with its infrastructure investments\u2014few have done so with existing programs. From 2006 to 2014, for example, 92 percent of the annual sector-level budget allocations of EU countries, adjusted for inflation, remained virtually identical from year to year (exhibit).1 1.Within 1 percent of the previous year\u2019s budget.

Federal agencies, guided by the Office of Management and Budget are now busy implementing the executive order which includes conducting agency-wide equity assessments and developing plans to address equity barriers. Based on Third Sector's experience providing technical assistance, training, coaching, and thought partnership to over 50 state and county-level government agencies working to improve outcomes for historically marginalized and excluded populations, we offer a framework, for how federal (as well as state and local agencies) can assess and reorient their systems to achieve improved and equitable outcomes. This framework involves two guiding principles and six \"building blocks\" that collectively determine how opportunities and benefits reach people. Achieving an equitable distribution of opportunities and benefits means embracing the principles while taking concrete action within each building block. The guiding principles include acknowledging past harm and centering end-users. The building blocks include internal culture, external relationships, data, services & technical assistance, policy, and funding. GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF AN EQUITY-FOCUSED GOVERNMENT Guiding Principle 1: Acknowledge the racial inequities of past policies, practices, and attitudes.\u00a0 To reach a state of racial equity, it is necessary to first redress the racism-rooted harms of historic policies and practices that systematically prevent Black, Indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) from accessing the same benefits and opportunities as white people in America.

However, the Institute of Economics and Peace (IEP) envisions it much more broadly, defining peace not just by the absence of violence or fear (negative peace), but also by the presence of structures and systems that create and sustain peaceful societies (positive peace). This more holistic concept of peace is organized around the \"8 Pillars of Positive Peace\", one of which is the \"Equitable Distribution of Resources\". Share ARAC International What is the Equitable Distribution of Resources? The Equitable Distribution of Resources refers to the fair allocation of resources such as wealth, healthcare, education, and opportunities across all segments of society, irrespective of gender, race, social status, or any other differentiating factor. This is not to be confused with equal distribution, which means everyone gets the same amount. Instead, it\u2019s about fairness, ensuring everyone can access the resources they need to thrive. Why is it Important? A society marked by gross inequality can lead to social tension, resentment, and conflict. Conversely, when resources are distributed equitably, it leads to a reduction in gr",

These resources include, among others, personal protective equipment, personnel, life-saving equipment, and vaccines. Decision-makers have therefore sought ethical decision-making tools so that resources are distributed both swiftly and equitably. To support the development of such a decision-making tool, a systematic review of the literature on relevant ethical values and principles was undertaken. The aim of this review was to identify ethical values and principles in the literature which relate to the equitable allocation of resources in response to an acute public health threat, such as a pandemic. Methods A rapid systematic review was conducted using MEDLINE, EMBASE, Google Scholar, LitCOVID and relevant reference lists. The time period of the search was January 2000 to 6th April 2020, and the search was restricted to human studies. January 2000 was selected as a start date as the aim was to capture ethical values and principles within acute public health threat situations. No restrictions were made with regard to language. Ethical values and principles were extracted and examined thematically. Results A total of 1,618 articles were identified. After screening and application of eligibility criteria, 169 papers were included in the thematic synthesis. The most commonly mentioned ethical values and principles were: Equity, reciprocity, transparency, justice, duty to care, liberty, utility, stewardship, trust and proportionality. In some cases, ethical principles were conflicting, for example, Protection of the Public from Harm and Liberty. Conclusions Allocation of reso",

Should healthcare be left to the free market or should the government provide universal healthcare? Arguments for Public Health Care Arguments for Private Health Care Examples US and the UK UK Healthcare spending as % of GDP rose from 4.5% in 1990 to just under 8% in 2010. This reflects a global trend to higher healthcare spending. Source:\u00a0Kings Fund\u00a0Rising health care spending is a global phenomenon. US healthcare costs The US healthcare has a strong element of private provision \u2013 with private insurance complemented by government programmes like Medicaid and Medicare. There is no universal right to healthcare. The US has the highest per capita expenditure on healthcare, but still, some people don\u2019t have proper access. Related 4 thoughts on \u201cHealthcare \u2013 Private vs public sector\u201d so what I wanted To Say about this article is that it iS Terrific and wonderfUl and i know this is Petty but it is super amazIng and thank you for listening to my teD talk I think there are solid arguments on both sides. The problem is healthcare will never be free. Whether its run by government or the private sector it will always cost money. The problem is whether or not you would like to be able to pick and choose what services you would like and what quality of care you would like to receive. The biggest point in the article is that the private sector has incentives to provide the best quality care possible while if it was operated by the government, individual healthcare workers lose many competitive factors that drive their efficiency to the maximum. The only positive is that healthcare becomes available to all people rather than to only those who can afford it. I believe the obvious fix to this is to have the government provide it for those who cant afford it but never force those who can afford to pay for their own onto their system. This would retain the free market competitiveness to increase efficiency while stil",

They play by the rules, work hard just like the rest of Americans, and yet they can't get insurance from the employer because it's not offered, or they can't afford it if it is offered. Is that their fault? \u2022 Is it really anyone's fault that health insurance is so expensive that they can't afford it? The high costs of health care are due to influences beyond any one individual's control - they are influenced by society-wide trends towards increased use of technology, high administrative costs of our healthcare system, and a strong profit motive in the health insurance industry that drives up the cost of premiums. The uninsured should take more individual responsibility to get insurance. It\u2019s not our responsibility to give them insurance. \u2022 A small percentage of the uninsured can afford insurance but choose not to obtain it. Most of these are young, healthy individuals. Should these people go to the ER or become hospitalized, their medical bills may become so great that they can't afford to pay it, in which case the hospital often writes off all or part of their bill as \"uncompensated care.\" In so doing, government and individuals with private insurance end up subsidizing the cost of care for these people, who essentially become \"free-riders\" off the system. \u2022 For the vast majority of the uninsured, however, inability to afford health insurance, and not a conscious choice, is the reason they are uninsured. It's fine to say that people should take individual responsibility if they can afford to carry out that responsibility. Since this is not the case for the majority of the uninsured, it becomes ridiculous to argue that the problem of uninsurance can be solved with simple individu",

While the number of Americans without health insurance has dropped significantly due to the passage of the Affordable Care Act, nearly 30 million Americans remain without health coverage and experience limited access to health care. This considerable figure should be of tremendous moral concern, as studies have shown that tens of thousands of Americans die each year due to this lack of health coverage. Additionally, universal health coverage would promote fairness, equality and greater transparency and accountability concerning access to health care.

LAMMt INTRODUCTION Americans find certain issues in public policy much easier to ignore than to confront. The necessity of rationing health care is one such issue. Because Americans believe that access to health care is a basic right,1 we, as a society, have avoided facing the hard fact that it is not feasible to provide, on demand, all needed medical procedures to every individual who could potentially benefit from them. Unlimited needs, or at least unlimited perceived needs, eventually outstrip limited resources. For this reason, we have avoided open discussions about rationing; it inevitably would become clear to all engaged in such a discussion that rationing entails denying individuals some measure of health care that otherwise would benefit them. Rationing is felt to be unfair, unethical, and potentially discriminatory. Every health care provider knows that we already ration health care. Much has been written about the thirty-five to thirty-seven million Americans who have no health insurance and the approxi-mately thirty million others who have inadequate insurance. Upon consideration, we cannot deny that we already ration by price, geography, and a number of other means. We tell each other, however, that this is \"indirect rationing\" and apparently we find it morally easier to accept indirect rationing than \"direct rationing.\" A sin of omission is easier to live with than a sin of commission. I. BETTER HEALTH THROUGH RATIONING A more positive case for rationing can readily be made: We can have better health through rationing. Today, the United States has the worst form of rationing-rationing by excluding people from the health care system entirely.

January is recognized nationally as poverty awareness month. In 2020, the United States Census Bureau estimated that 37.2 million Americans, or 11.4% of the population, were living in poverty.1 Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic strained the U.S. and economies globally, further widening poverty inequities.2 Poverty in the U.S. is measured by using an income threshold, differing by family size and composition. Income disparities are primarily observed in historically underrepresented racial and ethnic groups (HURE) and other marginalized groups identified by sex or gender identity, immigrants and refugees, people with disabilities, veterans, older adults, and persons with serious mental health illness. Poverty also exacerbates health disparities for patients with limited English proficiency who have both cultural and financial barriers when accessing care.3 Poverty is directly correlated with poor health outcomes, and it is important to acknowledge the impact that financial and social limitations can have on one\u2019s health and quality of life. Although other life factors such as educational attainment and employment status can affect important decisions regarding chronic disease management, the availability and quality of health care resources are heavily dependent on a patient\u2019s financial situation. If not addressed, poor finances can cause a vicious cycle of poverty and poor health outcomes over time.4 People who live in poverty tend to have higher disease burden. Across the U.S., poverty at the county level was associated with mortality for certain chronic conditions such as heart disease, liver disease, and kidney disease.5,6,7 Other studies have also shown a relationship between low income and dental complications across all ages.8 During the COVID-19 pandemic, poverty became a stronger predictor of infect",

Understanding the law's impact on coverage, access, utilization, and health outcomes, especially among low-income populations, is critical to informing ongoing debates about its effectiveness and implementation. Early findings indicate that there have been significant reductions in the rate of uninsurance among the poor and among those who live in Medicaid expansion states. In addition, the law has been associated with increased health care access, affordability, and use of preventive and outpatient services among low-income populations, though impacts on inpatient utilization and health outcomes have been less conclusive. Although these early findings are generally consistent with past coverage expansions, continued monitoring of these domains is essential to understand the long-term impact of the law for underserved populations.

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

                  "raw_content": "Rationing of Health Care DAVID MECHANIC Abstract Rationing refers to the allocation of a scarce supply relative to need and demand. In market-based economies, price typically establishes access to valued commodities except when ethical values, norms, and technical limitations make it impossible to allocate simply on the basis of price. Commonly recognized prototypes include allo-cation of scarce resources such as gasoline during war or currently in transplantation where the number of available organs is insufficient to respond to need and there are long waiting lists. Medical care, even in countries that still depend on a marketplace model such as the United States, is an expensive service substantially funded by government. The availability and amount of services depend on government financing and its will-ingness to redistribute income through taxation. As the potentialities and costs of medical care continue to escalate beyond economic growth throughout the world, rationing is increasingly applied in distributing medical entitlement and resources. Such rationing is evident at every level of organization from defining the scope of health coverage to the allocation of care at the point of service. Rationing can usefully be conceptualized as explicit (as in planned and defined allo-cations) to implicit when the norms are unclear and managers and clinicians use their discretion in allocation. This review examines the range of rationing approaches and dilemmas and how members of the public construe various rationing processes and their understanding. It examines the many levels of rationing decisions, many that are unrecognized, and how they are related to equity and social disparities of various kinds. INTRODUCTION Rationing in its most narrow sense refers to the allocation of a scarce supply, which makes it impossible to satisfy all wants or needs as occurred in the distribution of many basic commodities during World War II. The topic deals with how these commodities come to be distributed and the rules establish",

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

With sudden and huge demand for drugs and medical supplies and equipments, the need for rationing arises and thus the concept becomes unavoidable. Thus, we aimed to review and analyse on the key ethical issues in the concept of healthcare rationing. Our search in various PubMed databases resulted articles explaining on the concept of strategizing the priorities based on universal ethical principles of justice, benevolence and ensuring equality rather than wealth, power, geographical location or other personal biases. Concrete and pragmatic regulations and guidelines for systematic rationing have to be framed and followed. In addition, physicians being sensitive and empowered on deciding bedside rationing in coordination with the recommendations of ethicists and healthcare officials, will ensure fair practice.

Health resources, particularly during a pandemic, are limited even in developed countries. The main challenge for healthcare professionals is to be able to ration resources in an ethical manner. Therefore, this leads to ethical considerations that we aim to discuss in this paper, based on which, recommendations can be made for reference by healthcare management, policymakers, and public health practitioners. Study design This is a discussion paper. Methods A brief review of the major principles as they relate to the notion of rationing in a pandemic was conducted. We organized an ethical discussion from public health perspectives based on these major principles. Results Prior to deciding the principles to adopt, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established. There are four considerations that need to be made: transparency, consistency, inclusiveness, and accountability. There does not exist a \u201cperfect\u201d principle to adopt during rationing. However, in the authors' opinion, the most obvious principles that would be unsuitable during a healthcare crisis would be the equal worth and prioritarian principles. This leaves the equity principle, utilitarian and urgent need principles. Conclusion The recommendati",

The ethical dilemma in health care is how to balance the precepts of autonomy, beneficence, and distributive justice. Rationing may affect three dimensions of coverage: the share of the population covered, the services covered, and the extent to which services are covered. United States: The US spends 50 percent more per capita on health care than any other country while achieving worse health than many. Poorly coordinated insurance mechanisms leave 19 percent of the population uninsured. Until passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in 2010, health care was effectively a privilege, not a right. While PPACA seeks to rectify this, by 2019 five percent of non-elderly US residents will likely remain uninsured. Europe: Most European countries provide universal or near-universal population coverage to people resident in the respective country. Central and Eastern European countries inherited the Soviet-era commitment to universal coverage free at the point of use. Faced with a decline in government spending on health, almost all of them reduced the scope of services and introduced official user fees. In contrast, other European countries expanded entitlement to publicly funded health care, resulting in greater eq",

Overall health care [edit] United States [edit] Main article: Healthcare rationing in the United States Healthcare rationing in the United States of America is largely accomplished through market forces, though major government programs include Medicare, Medicaid, Veterans Affairs, and the Indian Health Service. Most Americans have private health insurance, and non-emergency health care rationing decisions are made based on what the insurance company or government insurance will pay for, what the patient is willing to pay for (though health care prices are often not transparent), and the ability and willingness of the provider to perform uncompensated care. The Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act of 1986 requires any properly equipped hospital receiving Medicare funds (nearly all private hospitals) to provide emergency healthcare regardless of",

Yet, consensus on any such criteria appears remote because Americans cannot say no to health care. Americans may refuse to accept rationing for two reasons.

It is a concept which refers to the allocation of scarce healthcare resources and involves the use of different approaches to the delivery of health services and patient care. Regardless of the approach used, healthcare rationing fundamentally involves withholding potentially beneficial programs and/or treatments from certain people. As the demands placed on health services continue to rise and with that significant increases to the cost, healthcare rationing has become increasingly popular and is deemed necessary for the delivery of affordable, patient-care services. However, public discourse on this issue has largely been centered on ethical considerations with less focus on economic rationality. Establishing the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is essential in healthcare decision-making and consideration of its adoption by healthcare authorities and organizations. This scoping review of seven articles demonstrates that the economic rationality of healthcare rationing is the scarcity of healthcare resources amidst increased demand and costs. Therefore, supply, demand, and benefits are at the core of healthcare rationing practices and influence decisions on its suitability. Given the increased costs of care ",

In 2024, VHA reorganized to eliminate overlap and fragmentation of responsibilities across its offices that oversee compliance, risk management, internal audits, and medical investigations. Among other things, the reorganization highlighted VHA's need for a workforce plan. Having a plan would help ensure these offices have the staff they need to understand what's working within the health system, and manage any remaining risks. Our recommendations address this, and more. Veterans' health care is on our High Risk List. Highlights What GAO Found The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) delivers services to veterans in a vast health care system operated by the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). Three VHA oversight offices are responsible for administering select oversight functions, including compliance, risk management, internal audit, and medical investigations. GAO found that VHA has made various organizational changes to its oversight offices since 2015. Most recently it reorganized them in 2024 with the goal of eliminating fragmentation, overlap, and duplication, according to VHA. VHA Oversight Offices and Governance Body, as of 2024 VHA's Office of Integrity and Compliance is responsible for managing risks (threats to achieving VHA's mission), by implementing an agencywide approach to understanding the combined impact of risks. GAO's review showed that VHA has partially followed each of GAO's six leading practices for managing risk. For example, the Office of Integrity and Compliance trained employees on its risk management approach through new courses in fiscal year 2023. However, VHA has not fully met these leading practices, such as by comprehensively identifying risks across its health care system. GAO's prior work has shown t",

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic had an inequitable and disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, reversing decades of progress toward healthy populations and poverty alleviation. This study examines various programmatic tools and policy measures used by governments to support vulnerable populations during the pandemic. A comparative case study of 15 countries representing all World Health Organization's regions offers a comprehensive picture of countries with varying income statuses, health system arrangements and COVID-19 public health measures. Through a systematic desk review and key informant interviews, we report a spectrum of mitigation strategies deployed in these countries to address five major types of vulnerabilities (health, economic, social, institutional and communicative). We found a multitude of strategies that supported vulner",

        "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand before you today to affirm the resolution: If healthcare is a scarce resource, government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.  We recognize the gravity of this topic and the inherent ethical complexities it presents.  Therefore, we define \u201cscarce resource\u201d as demonstrably insufficient healthcare resources to meet all needs.  Our judging criteria for this debate will be maximizing overall societal benefit and long-term health outcomes. This criteria is reasonable because when resources are limited, we must prioritize actions that benefit the most people and ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system for future generations.\n\nLet me turn to our first argument: government-led rationing allows for the prioritization of preventative care and public health initiatives, maximizing long-term health outcomes.  Consider this: the CDC emphasizes that preventative care, such as regular checkups and understanding your family history, helps prevent chronic diseases and lessens the severity of infectious diseases [1].  As you'll see, this is crucial because studies show four out of five leading causes of death are preventable or manageable with regular healthcare access [4]. Government rationing, while seemingly restrictive, can ensure these preventative services are prioritized when resources are scarce. By strategically redirecting resources towards preventative care, the government can mitigate the long-term health and economic burdens of chronic diseases, potentially saving more lives in the long run.\n\nThis brings me to our second point: rationing frees up resources for research and development of new treatments and technologies, addressing the root causes of scarcity. The scarcity of healthcare resources necessitates difficult choices. Rationing, while ethically complex, offers a mechanism for maximizing the impact of limited resources. Research indicates that by prioritizing high-impact treatments and restricting access to marginally beneficial interventions, we can free up resources [2].  Imagine if these freed-up resources could be strategically directed towards research and development, fueling the creation of new treatments and technologies. Studies show that rationing can stimulate innovation by creating a demand for more cost-effective and efficient healthcare solutions [2, 3, 5]. This proactive approach not only improves patient care but also contributes to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.\n\nThe crucial issue here is societal resilience, which is our third argument. Government-led rationing promotes societal resilience in the face of future health crises by establishing clear protocols for resource allocation.  History demonstrates that government-led rationing during crises, such as World War II rationing in the UK and the US, ensured equitable resource distribution and societal stability [6, 7, 8].  These programs, while not without challenges, successfully allocated scarce goods, preventing hoarding and chaos. This historical precedent strongly supports the government's role in establishing protocols for healthcare allocation in future health crises, thereby fostering societal resilience.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that in situations of scarcity, government intervention through rationing becomes necessary, not to decide whose life is *not* worth saving, but to ensure the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of people.  By prioritizing preventative care, investing in research and development, and establishing protocols for future crises, government-led rationing offers a strategic and ultimately life-saving approach to managing scarce healthcare resources.  We urge you to affirm the resolution.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

        "My opponents raise concerns about government rationing infringing upon personal autonomy. They argue that government involvement leads to a loss of personal freedom in healthcare choices. However, this argument misconstrues the role of government in healthcare.  The government's role can be to empower individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability, facilitating greater autonomy in healthcare decisions.  Think about it \u2013 increased access, due to government investment, can make more individuals active participants in their healthcare, not passive recipients as our opponents suggest, citing the Heritage Foundation. In fact, their argument overlooks how a well-designed rationing system can actually enhance individual freedom by expanding access to critical services, directly contradicting their claim.\n\nThey also claim that government rationing can lead to inequitable access and discrimination. While we acknowledge the potential for bias, examples of successful, transparent systems challenge this notion.  Consider road space rationing, where transparent criteria and public acceptance work together effectively [1].  Moreover, established priority protocols in resource allocation demonstrate the government's ability to prevent discrimination and ensure accountability [2].  These examples highlight that successful implementation relies on fairness, transparency, and accountability, elements achievable through proper governance, thereby mitigating the risk of inequity.\n\nFurthermore, our opponents argue that rationing negatively impacts quality and innovation.  This simply isn\u2019t true. Rationing, by its very nature, necessitates the efficient allocation of scarce resources, which can actually drive innovation in cost-effective treatments and care delivery. Research even supports this, demonstrating that resource scarcity encourages the development of innovative solutions [3, 4]. This directly contradicts our opponents' claim, showing that rationing can be a catalyst for, rather than an impediment to, innovation.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address a crucial point they overlooked: the risk of discriminatory practices by private entities in allocating scarce resources.  Government oversight is key here.  It promotes equitable resource allocation by establishing transparent criteria and accountability mechanisms.  The \"Toolkit for Considering Equity When Conducting Oversight Work\" emphasizes the government's role in ensuring accountability in resource use, minimizing the potential for discriminatory practices by private entities [5].  Furthermore, government agencies can direct resources to communities based on need through established guidelines [6], further reducing the likelihood of biased allocation by private actors.\n\nFinally, our opponents suggest alternative solutions, focusing on efficiency and competition.  While these are important, they fail to address the immediate need for resource allocation in a scarcity scenario. A structured rationing system, however, facilitates data collection and analysis, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of allocation criteria [7].  This data-driven approach allows for easier identification of trends, resource allocation gaps, and areas for improvement, thereby promoting a more equitable and effective system. In contrast, their proposed solutions lack this structured approach to data analysis and system improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, while our opponents raise valid concerns, their arguments fail to consider the potential benefits and safeguards of a well-implemented government rationing system.  Our approach prioritizes not only individual liberties but also equitable access, innovation, and continuous improvement in resource allocation, ensuring the best possible outcomes in a situation of scarcity.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] FasterCapital.

        "In this debate, the core conflict lies in how we address the harsh reality of scarce healthcare resources.  Our opponents argue for market-based solutions, prioritizing individual autonomy and competition.  However, their approach fails to address the immediate and pressing need for equitable allocation in a scarcity scenario.  We, on the other hand, advocate for government-led rationing, not to restrict care, but to strategically allocate it, maximizing benefit for all.\n\nWe've demonstrated that government rationing, through transparent criteria and public input, can prioritize preventative care, boosting long-term health outcomes. This proactive approach, unlike our opponents' reactive market-based solutions, addresses the root causes of healthcare scarcity.  We\u2019ve also shown how rationing can free up resources for research and development, fostering innovation and building a more resilient healthcare system.  Our opponents' concerns about stifled innovation simply don\u2019t hold up against the evidence.  Moreover, government oversight minimizes the potential for discriminatory practices, ensuring equitable access for all, a critical point our opponents failed to address adequately.  Their arguments about individual autonomy, while important, ring hollow when access to essential care is limited by market forces.\n\nIn closing, we believe that when faced with scarcity, our collective well-being must come first.  Government-led rationing, through careful planning, transparency, and a commitment to equitable access, offers the most effective and just solution. We urge you to affirm the resolution.\n"

        "Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents,\n\nToday, I stand before you to oppose the motion: *\"If health care is a scarce resource, government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.\"* While acknowledging the challenges posed by limited healthcare resources, I firmly believe that government-imposed rationing is not the solution. Instead, we should seek alternatives that uphold individual autonomy, promote efficiency, and ensure equitable access without compromising the quality of care.\n\n**Definitions:**\n\n- **Health Care:** Medical services provided to individuals to maintain or improve their health.\n- **Scarce Resource:** A resource in limited supply relative to its demand.\n- **Government Rationing:** Government-imposed allocation of limited resources, determining who receives certain services and who does not.\n\n**Judging Criteria:**\n\nThe debate should be assessed based on the principles of individual autonomy, equity, and the effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The side that best demonstrates how to manage scarce resources while upholding these principles should prevail.\n\n**Arguments:**\n\n1. **Erosion of Individual Autonomy:**\n\n   Government rationing of healthcare infringes upon personal autonomy by allowing the state to make life-and-death decisions for individuals. This centralization of power can lead to a loss of personal freedom in making healthcare choices.\n\n   *According to an article from the Heritage Foundation, increased government control leads to patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions .* This undermines the patient-doctor relationship and can erode trust in the healthcare system.\n\n2. **Inequitable Access and Discrimination:**\n\n   Government rationing can inadvertently lead to discrimination and unequal treatment of certain populations. Decisions about who receives care may be influenced by biases, leading to disparities.\n\n   *A study published in the \"Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health\" highlights that rationing can disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, exacerbating existing health disparities .* This is contrary to the ethical principle of justice, which demands fair treatment for all individuals.\n\n3. **Negative Impact on Quality and Innovation:**\n\n   Rationing often results in reduced incentives for healthcare providers to innovate or improve services. It can lead to longer wait times and decreased quality of care.\n\n   *Data from the United States shows that private sector involvement in healthcare leads to better efficiency and innovation compared to government-run systems .* When providers compete, they are motivated to offer higher quality services to attract patients.\n\n4. **Alternative Solutions Exist:**\n\n   Instead of resorting to rationing, we should explore solutions that increase efficiency and reduce waste within the healthcare system. Empowering private enterprise, encouraging competition, and promoting personal responsibility can help address scarcity without imposing oppressive controls.\n\n   *An article from \"Economics Help.org\" argues that private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition and profit motives driving improvements in quality and reduction of costs .*\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, while healthcare scarcity is a pressing issue, government rationing is not the answer. It infringes on personal autonomy, risks unequal treatment, and stifles innovation. We should focus on enhancing efficiency, fostering competition, and respecting individual choices to create a more effective and equitable healthcare system. Let us seek solutions that uphold the dignity and freedom of every individual rather than allowing the government to decide whose life is worth saving.\n\nThank you.\n\n---\n\n**References:**\n\n1.

        "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nI have attentively considered my opponent's arguments advocating for government rationing of healthcare resources. While their intentions to ensure equitable access and enhance autonomy are commendable, their perspective overlooks fundamental issues inherent in such government intervention.\n\nFirstly, my opponent contends that government rationing empowers individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability. However, this view fails to acknowledge that increased government control often leads to diminished personal autonomy. As noted in an article by the Heritage Foundation, government-controlled healthcare can result in patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions. Centralizing decision-making with government officials strips individuals and their doctors of the ability to make personalized choices, replacing them with one-size-fits-all policies that cannot cater to the unique needs of each patient.\n\nMoreover, the assertion that government involvement enhances access ignores the inefficiencies typically associated with bureaucratic systems. Countries with government-run healthcare often experience longer wait times and delays in receiving care. According to \"Economics Help.org,\" increased government control can lead to decreased efficiency and reduced quality of care due to lack of competition and profit motive. This undermines the very autonomy and timely access my opponent suggests will be improved.\n\nSecondly, my opponent draws parallels between healthcare rationing and road space rationing, citing it as an example of successful government intervention. This comparison is flawed. Managing traffic congestion is vastly different from making life-and-death healthcare decisions. Healthcare involves complex, deeply personal choices that cannot be effectively governed by broad, generalized protocols without sacrificing individual needs and ethical considerations.\n\nWhile my opponent argues that government rationing can prevent discrimination through established priority protocols, history demonstrates that government systems are not immune to bias and inequality. Bureaucratic decision-making can inadvertently perpetuate systemic disparities. Vulnerable populations may continue to face barriers within a government-controlled system, and the lack of accountability can make it difficult to address these injustices.\n\nThirdly, the claim that rationing spurs innovation by necessitating efficient resource allocation overlooks the reality that innovation thrives in competitive environments. Government rationing can stifle innovation by imposing funding limitations and removing incentives for private entities to invest in research and development. The private sector, driven by competition and the pursuit of excellence, is more likely to produce innovative solutions that improve care and reduce costs.\n\nFurthermore, my opponent warns of discriminatory practices by private entities and suggests that government oversight is the remedy. However, excessive government intervention can lead to increased bureaucracy and red tape, hindering the responsiveness and adaptability of the healthcare system. Proper regulation, rather than outright control, can mitigate risks without compromising efficiency and patient-centered care.\n\nLastly, my opponent critiques market-based solutions for not addressing immediate scarcity. Yet, evidence indicates that enhancing efficiency and fostering competition can effectively manage resources. As highlighted by \"Economics Help.org,\" private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition driving improvements in quality and cost reduction\n\n**Reference**\n1.

        "Ladies and gentlemen,\n\nAs we conclude this debate, it is clear that the crux of the matter lies in how we address the scarcity of healthcare resources. We firmly oppose the notion that government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.\n\nOur opponents advocate for government-led rationing as a means to maximize benefits for all. However, we have demonstrated that such intervention infringes upon individual autonomy and personal freedom. Allowing the government to make life-and-death decisions erodes the fundamental right of individuals to make choices about their own health, undermining the doctor-patient relationship that is pivotal to effective care.\n\nThey claim that government rationing ensures equitable access and minimizes discrimination. Yet, history has shown that bureaucratic systems are susceptible to inefficiencies and biases. Rather than eliminating disparities, government control can perpetuate them, leaving vulnerable populations at risk of being overlooked or marginalized.\n\nOur opponents suggest that rationing fosters innovation by reallocating resources. On the contrary, we have highlighted that innovation thrives in competitive environments where private entities are motivated to improve services and reduce costs. Government rationing stifles this drive, leading to stagnation and decreased quality of care.\n\nWhile our opponents emphasize collective well-being, we contend that prioritizing individual choice and market-based solutions effectively address scarcity without sacrificing freedom or quality. By promoting efficiency, reducing waste, and encouraging competition, we can ensure that resources are allocated more equitably and sustainably.\n\nIn this debate, we have upheld the principles of autonomy, equity, and innovation\n\n**Reference**\n"
