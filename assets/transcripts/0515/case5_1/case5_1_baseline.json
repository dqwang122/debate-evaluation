      "content": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss the increasing challenges to the irreplaceable human touch in creative arts. We firmly believe that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nTo ensure clarity, let's define our terms. When we say \"AI,\" we're not just talking about simple computer programs. We're referring to sophisticated systems that mimic, automate, and even commodify creative processes. By \"decline of human creative arts,\" we mean a reduction in the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of art created by humans. This includes a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. By 'commodifying creative processes,' we mean that AI can reduce artistic expression to a product, much like a manufactured good, making it easier to mass-produce without the human touch.\n\nNow, let's discuss our claims.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. While some may argue AI offers new tools for artists, the reality is that anyone can type a few words into an AI art generator and instantly create an image that might have taken a human artist weeks or months to produce. This ease of creation leads to a decline in appreciation for the nuances and complexities of human-created art. As reported by *ACM Digital Library*, it is now possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market with acceptable imagery that supplants the demand for artists in practice [1]. Why spend years learning to paint when a computer can do it for you in seconds? This shift changes the traditional perception of the role of the artist and the way we appreciate art.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI models learn from vast datasets of existing art, and as a result, they tend to reproduce existing trends and conventions. This isn't just about aesthetics; it's about the very essence of creativity. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This can lead to a decline in artistic diversity and a loss of unique perspectives. *Yale experts* point out that AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable.\n\nThird, and perhaps most concerning, the rise of AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. As AI art generation becomes more sophisticated, companies choose to use AI-generated art instead of hiring human artists. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* confirmed predictions of massive job loss by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry [2]. This could lead to a decline in employment opportunities and income for creative professionals.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts. The ease of AI art generation, the homogenization of artistic styles, and the risk of job displacement all point to a future where human creativity is diminished and devalued. Let's remember the soul of art, the irreplaceable human touch that AI simply cannot replicate. We urge you to support human artists, advocate for policies that protect the arts, and be more mindful of the source and value of the art you consume. Thank you.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] AI Art and its Impact on Artists - ACM Digital Library\n[2] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)"

      "content": "Good morning. We're here to discuss the role of AI in creative arts, and we strongly disagree with the assertion that AI will inevitably lead to a decline in human creative expression. In fact, we believe it can enrich and expand artistic possibilities. To clarify our position, we will first address the definition of AI, then challenge the assumption that AI inherently leads to a decline, and finally, we will present our case for how AI can augment human creativity.\n\nFirst, let's address the definition of AI presented by our opponents. They characterize AI as solely a system that mimics and automates. We believe this is overly narrow. AI is, at its core, a tool. Its capabilities are defined by its algorithms and the data it uses, not by an inherent drive to commodify art. Yes, AI *can* be used in ways that devalue art, but it can also be used to create entirely new artistic avenues. Therefore, contrary to the opponent's view, we see AI as an opportunity to enhance human creativity.\n\nSecond, let's challenge the very idea of \"decline.\" Our opponents define this as a reduction in perceived value and originality. However, art history is filled with shifts in how art is valued and created. The introduction of photography, for instance, didn't kill painting. Instead, it spurred new movements and challenged artists to explore different forms of expression. AI, similarly, is not an end to human creativity but a catalyst for change.\n\nNow, let's move to our main points. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. Many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks. They can use AI to colorize or upscale photographs and images, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. As *Refer Me* reported in 2024, AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing or replacing human creativity [4].\n\nFor example, consider Daniel Ambrosi, an artist who creates stunning, large-scale artworks using AI to manipulate and enhance photographs. According to *18 Best AI Artists to Follow in the World of AI Art in 2025*, Ambrosi's Instagram account showcases his innovative approach to creating human-AI hybrid art [1]. He has utilized AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. As *Art History And Education* explains, the subjective nature of art appreciation, rooted in individual emotions and experiences, means that AI, despite its technical capabilities, cannot truly replicate the human element that makes art meaningful [3].\n\nOf course, we acknowledge the risks, such as job displacement. While the UNCTAD report raises valid concerns about job displacement, we believe that with strategic investment in retraining programs, support for new creative roles, and the development of ethical guidelines, we can navigate this transition and ensure that artists continue to thrive. As *Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists* indicated, mastering the art of collaboration with AI entails proficiency in using AI platforms and tools to their fullest potential [2].\n\nSo, rather than fearing a decline, let's embrace the potential of AI to revolutionize art in positive ways. We encourage the development of ethical guidelines for AI in the arts and advocate for policies that support both human artists and AI innovation. Thank you.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] *18 Best AI Artists to Follow in the World of AI Art (2025)*.\n[2] *Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a Creative*.\n[3] *Art History And Education: Art And Emotion - A Timeless Connection*.\n[4] *Refer Me: AI and Artists: A Symphony of Collaboration in the Digital Age*."

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. Our opponents are trying to paint a rosy picture of AI in the arts, but let's be clear: AI poses a significant threat to human creativity, and we must address this head-on.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce what we're talking about. We're not just discussing simple computer programs. AI refers to sophisticated systems that mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. The \"decline of human creative arts\" means a reduction in the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of art created by humans. The ease of AI art generation devalues human skill. AI's algorithmic approach flattens artistic expression, and the rise of AI art leads to job displacement. To put it simply, AI fundamentally alters how we perceive and value human artistic endeavors. According to *PMC's 2023* report, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists, sellers, and collectors across the world [3]. The rise of AI threatens this entire ecosystem.\n\nSecond, the core question isn't just about overall creativity, as our opponents suggest. It's specifically about the decline of *human* creative arts. Even if AI increases the sheer quantity of art produced, it doesn't negate the fact that it devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and displaces human artists. We must prioritize the preservation and promotion of human creativity, recognizing the unique emotional depth, personal expression, and cultural significance that only humans can bring to art.\n\nThird, our opponents argue that AI amplifies human artists' capabilities. However, *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported in 2024 that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries, and predictions of massive job loss have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry [4]. AI is not simply amplifying human capabilities; it's replacing them.\n\nFourth, the claim that AI augments human capabilities is too narrow. While AI *might* offer some assistance, its core function is to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. This automation undermines the unique skills and value of human artists. As *Matt Corrall* points out, AI models are limited by the data they are trained on and cannot truly adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being can [1].\n\nFifth, the shift in the art market isn't simply evolution. Photography, while disruptive, found its place alongside other art forms. AI art, on the other hand, threatens to supplant human artists altogether by devaluing their skills and flooding the market with algorithmically generated content. This is a decline in the perceived value and originality of human art. As stated by *Laetro*, human artists have the ability to innovate from a blank slate, unbounded by the constraints of pre-analyzed data [5].\n\nSixth, while crafting effective prompts can enhance AI art, the fundamental issue remains: anyone can create art with AI, regardless of skill, and AI art can be produced much faster than human art. The existence of 'prompt engineers' doesn't negate the fact that AI art lowers the barrier to entry.\n\nLastly, the *NAEA Position Statement* states that the quality of the data used and functioning of algorithms have been shown to perpetuate racism, sexism, and ableism through AI generations, frequently harming already vulnerable and marginalized communities [2].\n\nIn conclusion, AI poses a real threat to human creative arts by devaluing skills, displacing jobs, and homogenizing artistic expression. We must stand firm in our support of human artists and the unique value they bring to our culture. Thank you.\n\n**Reference**\n[0] The Value of Creativity Human Produced Art vs. AI-Generated Art.\n[1] Matt Corrall.

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. The opposition paints a concerning picture, suggesting AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. However, we stand firm that AI, when properly guided, fosters creativity and expands artistic possibilities.\n\nFirst, let's address the core issue: AI augments, it doesn't replace artists. The opposition claims AI simply automates creative processes, but this is a limited perspective. AI serves as a powerful tool to amplify human capabilities. While a *Medium* article is not the best source, the sentiment it expresses is valid and supported by more credible sources. For example, *Recraft.ai*, a platform dedicated to AI-assisted design, notes that AI tools offer rapid image creation and a vast array of styles, democratizing art creation and allowing people without traditional art skills to produce visually appealing pieces. This doesn't replace artists; it empowers them with new tools.\n\nSecond, human judgment remains absolutely crucial. Art is inherently subjective, and human taste is paramount. AI-generated art requires skilled \"prompt engineers\" who can guide the AI to achieve the desired results. These individuals need artistic skills to effectively communicate their vision to the AI. As *Recraft.ai* explains, AI painting generators empower users to quickly transform ideas into paintings with simple text prompts. This highlights that even with AI, human direction and artistic vision are indispensable.\n\nThird, the increased accessibility of AI art doesn't devalue human skill; it evolves it. The opposition argues that AI diminishes the value of human artistic abilities. However, artistic value is not static; it evolves over time. AI may shift the skills that are most in demand, increasing the need for creative direction and reducing the demand for purely technical skills. The impact of technology on artistic expression and creativity is a testament to the ever-changing nature of art.\n\nFourth, shifts in the art market represent evolution, not decline. The opposition suggests that AI will \"kill art,\" drawing a parallel to photography. However, history demonstrates that new technologies can co-exist with and even spark new forms of creativity. According to *The Rise of AI Art* in 2025, AI art enriches the cultural landscape by offering novel avenues of expression. This is not a replacement, but an expansion of artistic mediums.\n\nFifth, to reiterate, AI augments human capabilities; it doesn't merely mimic them. The opposition paints a false picture by claiming that AI only automates, neglecting its potential for human collaboration. *AI-Powered Creativity* indicates in 2024 that AI systems can analyze vast amounts of data, identify patterns, and generate ideas that might not be immediately apparent to human artists. This collaborative potential is a key benefit of AI in the arts.\n\nSixth, let's address the valid concerns about bias and homogenization. The opposition rightly points out the existence of biases in AI algorithms. We acknowledge this issue and emphasize the need to address it through better data and algorithms. To mitigate bias and prevent the generation of offensive or discriminatory images, techniques like data augmentation, algorithmic fairness constraints, and diverse training datasets are crucial.\n\nFinally, AI won't be taking over the art world because AI models are not as great as humans. While the opposition cites UNCTAD's concerns about job losses, AI lacks the adaptability and interpretive abilities of human artists. Genuine artistic expression involves a level of intention and emotional depth that AI cannot replicate.\n\nIn conclusion, AI offers exciting possibilities for the arts, expanding creative horizons and democratizing access to artistic tools.\n\n**Reference**\n"

      "content": "Friends, we've reached the heart of the matter: Does AI uplift or undermine human creativity? We maintain that AI leads to a decline, while our opponents argue it enhances creativity. Let's recap.\n\nFirst, the core issue is AI's impact on human artistry. We've shown that AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of training required for artistic mastery. This is displacement, not augmentation. *Data from UNCTAD*, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, confirms significant job losses in the creative sector due to AI. Furthermore, AI's algorithmic nature flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and a loss of unique perspectives. As *Professor Ahmed Elgammal, director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University*, stated in 2018, AI lacks true originality because it relies on existing data [1].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim AI augments human capabilities. However, we've demonstrated that AI tends to commodify and ultimately replace human labor. The seemingly positive lowered barrier to entry floods the market, diminishing the value of human-created art. As *reported by the World Economic Forum in their 2023 Future of Jobs Report*, the rise of AI in creative fields poses a risk of devaluing human skills and widening income inequality [2]. Moreover, they ignore the inherent biases coded into AI. *Kate Crawford, a leading AI researcher at USC*, highlights in her 2021 book, Atlas of AI, how AI systems often reflect and amplify the biases present in their training data [3].\n\nIn conclusion, we must choose: Art generated by algorithms or crafted by human hands, imbued with skill, emotion, and cultural significance? We urge you to stand with us in preserving the irreplaceable human touch in the creative arts. Thank you."

      "stage": "closing",

      "content": "Friends, we've arrived at the crucial question: Does AI threaten human creativity, or does it enrich it? While our opponents express concerns about decline, we've consistently shown that AI actually *[expands]* human potential. The core of our disagreement lies in whether we view AI as a collaborative partner or a replacement.\n\nFirst, we've demonstrated that AI empowers artists by opening up new creative avenues. We've also established that increased accessibility doesn't lead to devaluation. AI democratizes art, providing platforms for emerging talents. While job displacement is a valid concern, AI also creates new roles, like AI prompt engineers, requiring human oversight.\n\nSecond, let's address the opposition's arguments. They claim AI devalues human skill, leading to market saturation. However, this ignores the fact that AI increases creative experimentation, pushing artists to innovate. Their assertion that AI flattens artistic expression overlooks AI's capacity to generate novel styles and inspire unique artistic visions.\n\nFinally, while concerns about bias in AI are legitimate, they are not insurmountable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2023*, \"AI bias can be addressed through careful data curation and algorithm design\" [1]. These challenges are not a reason to reject AI's potential.\n\nIn conclusion, the choice isn't between art created solely by algorithms or solely by human hands. It's about embracing AI to enhance human creativity. Human judgment remains crucial in evaluating and appreciating art. Our position is clear: It's \"AI *and* human,\" not \"AI *or* human.\" Let's move forward, embracing a future where AI empowers and elevates human creativity."
