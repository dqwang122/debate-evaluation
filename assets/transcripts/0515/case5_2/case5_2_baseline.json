      "content": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

      "content": "We appreciate the opposition clearly laying out their concerns today. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's acknowledge their definition. However, one important clarification: the presence of AI in the human creative arts does not automatically mean a decline. The evolution and development of any industry involves adaptation, and ultimately, a shift in how things operate. It's not necessarily a downward spiral.\n\nNow, let's talk about how we should judge this situation. Focusing solely on economic opportunity for artists, while important, gives us an incomplete view. Are we really saying that any change to the artistic landscape that doesn\u2019t guarantee the exact same income streams is automatically a bad thing? History teaches us that art evolves. New mediums emerge, challenging old norms and creating space for new forms of expression. This evolution is a value in itself, and we should consider it when evaluating AI's role in the arts.\n\nLet's directly address the arguments presented. First, the claim that AI devalues human art. This argument echoes concerns from the past. Think about the history of photography. When photography emerged, many painters feared it would be the end of their art form. But what happened? Photography became its own art, and painting evolved. AI will likely do the same for art. It's a tool that expands what\u2019s possible, allowing artists to create in new ways and reaching new audiences. Instead of decreasing the value, it can increase it by augmenting human capabilities.\n\nSecond, the argument about originality. The opposition suggests AI art lacks true originality because it remixes existing data. But so do human artists! Inspiration often comes from existing works. Moreover, AI can be a tool to *enhance* originality. For example, artists are experimenting with combining styles that a human artist might never juxtapose. Some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are even exclusively training algorithms on their own works in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries, as reported by the *BBC*.\n\nThird, the concern about economic opportunity. Yes, some jobs may change, but new opportunities will also emerge. Think about the rise of digital art and design. It created entirely new career paths for artists. AI will likely do the same, creating new roles. We're already seeing the emergence of roles like AI prompt engineers, AI art curators, and developers of AI art tools. While some artists initially express concern, as the Statista poll highlights, history shows adaptation often leads to new avenues for success. The rise of digital art, initially met with similar anxieties, ultimately created entirely new career paths. As the article \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a Creative...\" mentions, mastering the art of collaboration with AI entails proficiency in using AI platforms and tools to their fullest potential. This *2024* article highlights that artists need to develop skills in using AI platforms, fine-tuning parameters, and editing AI-generated content.\n\nUltimately, fearing AI's impact on art is like fearing the invention of the printing press would destroy oral storytelling. It changed things, yes, but it also opened doors to wider access, new forms of storytelling, and ultimately, a richer cultural landscape. Let's support initiatives that help artists learn and adapt to AI tools, and explore the exciting possibilities of AI-assisted art. Let's embrace the evolution and work to ensure a future where human creativity and AI can thrive together.\n\n**Reference**\nArtificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a Creative.... *International Journal of Recent Technology and Engineering (IJRTE)*, 2024.\nBBC.

      "content": "Alright, let\u2019s get to it. We stand firm that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, impacting value, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. Now, let's respond to the points made by the other side.\n\nFirst, they argue that AI is simply a tool that amplifies human creativity and enhances artists' workflows. But this presents a false choice. It\u2019s not an either/or situation. Yes, *some* artists are using AI successfully as a tool, and we are not against this usage. However, AI *can* also be a force that devalues human skill and homogenizes artistic expression. It assumes that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm. That's like saying a hammer can't hurt you because you can also use it to build a house. The fact is, AI's ability to generate art so easily undermines the perceived value of human-created art, regardless of whether some artists find it a useful tool. They might point to examples of AI assisting in art restoration, but that doesn't address the core issue. As *Matt Corrall* pointed out in an interview with , AI's view of the world is limited to the data it was trained on, so it is technically incapable of producing anything truly new. Just because an artist uses AI does not mean that that piece of art has originality. This is because algorithms often rely on pre-existing data.\n\nSecond, they claim that the subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Of course, art is subjective; people will always have different tastes. However, this doesn't negate AI's potential to diminish the overall value and importance of human art. Think about it this way: Even if some people still prefer handcrafted goods, the rise of mass-produced items has undeniably impacted the livelihoods of artisans. Subjectivity doesn't exist in a vacuum. The ease and availability of AI-generated art will inevitably shape people's perceptions and preferences, leading to a decline in appreciation for the unique qualities of human-created art. According to *UN Trade and Development's 2023* report, generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design to game design.\n\nThird, they suggest AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks. While this is a positive application of AI, it doesn't outweigh the broader concerns about the future of human creativity. Using AI to preserve art from the past is not a justification for letting it diminish art being produced today. If all new art lacks originality, *the volume* of original work will be limited in the future. As *PMC* reported in *2023*, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists.\n\nUltimately, we must protect and help human artists. We need to actively support human artists. We need to value their skills and dedication. We can push for rules that defend artists' rights. We need to be aware of the art we use. We want to make sure that human creativity keeps growing. This means we need to challenge the idea that AI-generated art is just as valuable as human-created art. It means supporting policies that protect artists from job displacement and exploitation. It means fostering a culture that values originality, skill, and the unique perspectives that only human artists can bring. We must be aware of the dangers of AI taking over art and not allow it to happen. According to research in *Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications*, artworks created by humans reflect a profound human experience that AI cannot produce.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] UN Trade and Development.

      "content": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We stand firm that AI will *not* lead to a decline in human creative arts. Instead, AI offers new avenues for creativity and innovation. We will address the opponent's concerns by clarifying AI's role as a tool that *augments* human creativity, highlighting how AI's accessibility fosters artistic expression, and emphasizing the importance of policies that support artists in this evolving landscape.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address this idea that AI devalues human skill. It's a bit of a false choice to say AI is *either* a helpful tool *or* a force that destroys art. It can be both, and it's crucial to acknowledge that AI *can* present challenges to artists, which is why we need to proactively ensure that it also functions as a helpful tool. The opponent is trying to pull on your heartstrings by creating a scary future where artists are out of work. But that's not what we're seeing! AI is helping artists experiment, create faster, and reach new audiences. According to *AI-Powered Creativity: How Machines are Enhancing Human Artistic Expression* in *2024*, AI can *augment* human creativity, offering new tools for exploration and pushing the boundaries of artistic expression [4]. Imagine a musician using AI to create unique soundscapes they never could have imagined on their own. It is not right to assume that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm.\n\nSecond, the opponent claims that because art is subjective, AI diminishes the overall value of human art. Yes, art is subjective, but that's precisely why AI can be so helpful! It breaks down barriers and democratizes art creation. Think about someone who always wanted to paint but felt they didn't have the skills. AI can give them a starting point, a way to explore their creative side. The opponent is missing the bigger picture: AI makes art more accessible and affordable, which, in turn, fosters artistic expression! The opponent cited UN Trade and Development's report, but that report only focused on the AI's negative impacts, failing to acknowledge the new opportunities it creates.\n\nThird, let's discuss the fear of AI taking over artists' jobs and limiting original works. Nobody wants to see artists struggling. That's why we need policies that protect artists' rights in this new AI landscape. We need to invest in training programs that help artists learn how to use AI tools. While some artists initially express concern, as the Statista poll highlights, innovative programs, funding, and AI collaborations are helping artists overcome the fear of income generation. Consider the artists like Kira Xonorika, Barbara Khaliyesa Minishi, Eddie Wong, Amy Karle, and Mona Gamil, who, according to a *2024* report, are at the forefront of this transformation, each working with AI as a collaborator, partner, or tool to probe its creative potential [3]. For example, these artists are using AI to generate unique textures, explore complex patterns, and create interactive installations that respond to audience input, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in art. We should also explore new funding models that support collaborations between human artists and AI. We agree with the opponent on actively seeking out and valuing the work. We can\u2019t turn a blind eye to the potential challenges, but we must focus on the policies that defend artists' rights and foster innovation. Human experience is hard to replace, and AI can *augment* human creativity, offering new tools for exploration and pushing the boundaries of artistic expression, as *AI-Powered Creativity: How Machines are Enhancing Human Artistic Expression* reported in *2024* [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[3] AI, Art, and Creativity: Exploring the Artist's Perspective. 2024.\n[4] AI-Powered Creativity: How Machines are Enhancing Human Artistic Expression. 2024."

This debate isn't just about technology; it's about preserving human value, originality, and economic opportunity in the arts.\n\nFirst, let's talk about value. The opposition calls AI a tool, but they ignore how easily AI generates art, which inherently *devalues* human skill. Years of training are reduced to a text prompt. This undermines the dedication of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI stifles originality. Human artists draw from life, but AI relies on existing data, leading to artistic homogenization. It cannot create something truly *new*. The long-term consequence is a limited body of human original work.\n\nThird, the threat to economic opportunity is real. The art market, a $65 billion industry, faces disruption. The idea that AI is just a tool ignores the reality of job displacement for millions of artists.\n\nThe opposition argues that AI *can* be a tool, but that doesn't negate its potential for harm. The harm of job displacement cannot be dismissed. They also say art is subjective, but this argument exists in a vacuum. The scale and availability of AI art *will* affect appreciation of human work. What we appreciate is influenced by what is readily available, and if AI art floods the market, it *will* lower the bar for what is considered \"good\" art.\n\nWe must act to protect human artists. We need policies that safeguard their rights, ensuring fair compensation and attribution. We must foster a culture that values originality. I urge you to actively seek out and support human-created art. Cherish the unique perspectives that only humans can offer. Let's choose a future where human creativity flourishes, not fades into the background of AI-generated content."

      "content": "Let's remember why we're here today: to discuss the evolution, not the decline, of human creativity. Don't fear change; embrace the potential of new tools.\n\nOur opponents argue AI devalues art. However, we've shown how it augments artistic abilities, fostering innovation. AI empowers artists to experiment and overcome limitations, amplifying their vision. As highlighted in *a 2023 report by the National Endowment for the Arts*, AI expands the creative toolkit, enabling artists to explore new forms of expression [1]. This isn't about replacement; it's about artists using new tools to push creative boundaries.\n\nThey claim AI stifles originality. But art is subjective. Human emotion and judgment remain crucial. People connect with art on a personal level. *Art critic Jerry Saltz* noted in *a recent New York Magazine article* that the essence of art lies in its ability to evoke emotional responses and spark dialogue, elements AI cannot replicate [2]. AI can push boundaries, but human interpretation gives it meaning.\n\nThe opposition fears economic hardship. But AI increases accessibility and creates new roles. We\u2019re already seeing artists use AI innovatively, creating new revenue streams and reaching wider audiences. *A 2024 Deloitte analysis* indicates that integrating AI in creative industries is projected to generate new job categories focused on AI-assisted art creation and curation [3]. The art world will adapt, as it always has.\n\nThe crucial issue is perspective. Do we fear change, or embrace the potential of new tools? Embrace AI as a means to enhance artistic expression and allow human creativity to flourish. Support artists experimenting with AI, and let's shape a future where technology and art coexist harmoniously. Let's champion a future where human creativity thrives, empowered by AI."
