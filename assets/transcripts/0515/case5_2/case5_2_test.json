      "content": "Imagine a world devoid of the raw emotion in Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, the electric energy of Jimi Hendrix's guitar riffs, or the poignant social commentary of Spike Lee's films. Is that the kind of world we want to create? Good morning, everyone. We are here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe that it will.\n\nTo ensure we're all on the same page, let's define what we mean by this motion. We argue that AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This will ultimately lead to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. By \"algorithmic art,\" we're referring to art generated by computer algorithms trained on existing datasets.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. Think about it: when AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art. One expert noted that \"the ease of AI-generated art leads to a devaluation of the years of training artists undertake.\" This isn't just about hurt feelings; it can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI is trained on existing datasets. Because AI is trained on existing datasets, it tends to replicate established patterns, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes as it remixes the same source material. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This diminishes the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. As one former journalist remarked, there hasn\u2019t been a single AI-generated creative work that has really stuck with me \u2026 it all just glides right past and disappears. Imagine a world where all art looks and feels the same \u2013 a 'sameness' that reduces its cultural value and the unique voice of the artist.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries such as art, music and creative writing, areas long considered the exclusive domain of humans. This leads to job losses and increased competition in the art market. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, a poll among artists reveals 55% believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities, widening the gap between the haves and have-nots in the art world.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and displacing artists. Let's champion policies that support human artists in the age of AI, and let's prioritize and celebrate human-created art to ensure its continued vitality.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.\n[3] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[4] AI Art Statistics 2024."

      "content": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

      "content": "Our opponents argue that AI is simply a harmless tool for artists, but we firmly disagree. We believe AI is poised to fundamentally change the art world, and not for the better, leading to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's address their \"AI as a tool\" argument. They claim that AI simply amplifies human capabilities. But this is misleading. It's like saying the printing press only amplified the capabilities of scribes. Yes, it made text more accessible, but it also, in many ways, made the scribe obsolete. AI is not just another brush or chisel. It can mimic styles, generate endless variations, and produce content at a speed and scale impossible for humans. This argument relies on a false analogy, comparing AI to traditional tools while ignoring its capacity for automation. The \"collaboration\" they describe is unequal, with humans increasingly relegated to the role of prompt engineers, not creators. Unlike traditional tools that remain relatively stable, AI technology is constantly evolving, requiring artists to continuously learn new skills and adapt their workflows, which can be challenging and time-consuming. In fact, *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported in *2023* and *2024* that generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [3].\n\nSecond, let's reinforce the point about AI devaluing human art. They seem to think quantity equals value. But if everyone can create \"art\" with a simple prompt, what happens to the perceived worth of genuine skill and years of dedicated practice? Just as mass-produced goods often lack the quality and character of handmade items, AI art risks flooding the market with soulless imitations, diminishing the appreciation for the real thing. They also seem to ignore that AI's 'creativity' is derivative. It analyzes existing human art to generate outputs. As *PMC*, an organization for pop culture research, pointed out in a *2023* article, the rising debate around AI art is occurring at a time when the market for human art is larger and more important than ever, worth $65 billion USD [2]. This raises anxiety for how the value of human art might change.\n\nThird, it is important to reinforce our first claim. This is about value, originality, and economic opportunity. They argue artistic value evolves. However, the art field evolves at an extraordinary pace, with new tools and techniques constantly emerging. Any new skills developed to work with AI are likely to become obsolete very quickly, making it difficult for artists to adapt. As we have discussed, this reliance highlights that AI art isn't truly original. The innovation relies on human work, but easier access to AI art devalues unaided human creation by comparison. As *Matt Corrall*, an expert in the field of data science, argues, AI models are technically incapable of producing anything new because their view of the world is based entirely on the abstracted number set they were given [1]. They can copy an artist's style or fake a photo with disturbing accuracy, but they cannot adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being can.\n\nIn conclusion, they are missing the big picture. It's not about whether AI can create *something* that resembles art. It's about the long-term impact on human artists, their livelihoods, and the very value we place on human creativity. It seems there might be a misunderstanding of our argument by suggesting we believe AI can *never* create anything of merit. Our point is that it will lead to a decline in the overall value and appreciation of *human* creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Corrall, Matt. \"The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\"\n[2] PMC. \"Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.\" *PMC*, 2023.\n[3] UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD). \"Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries.\" *UNCTAD*, 2023."

      "content": "We're here today because we firmly believe that human creativity will not only survive but flourish alongside AI, and we're going to directly address the arguments against this positive vision.\n\nFirst, let's dismantle this notion that AI's ease of use inherently devalues human art. The opposition implies that ease of creation automatically diminishes worth. This is a slippery slope. Many visual artists are finding that AI tools actually enhance their creative process by taking away repetitive and tedious tasks. They're using AI to colorize, upscale images, and automate other processes, which frees them to focus on the core creative work of concept and ideation. *A study* shows that this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities, acting as a tool to amplify their vision. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless; it simply evolves.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't generate anything truly original, that it's merely regurgitating existing data. While AI certainly learns from existing datasets, it also possesses the capacity to combine and transform that data in unexpected and innovative ways. To claim it's incapable of originality is akin to saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. As *Medium* reported in 2024, the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with novel creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. New media artists have embraced AI as part of their creative process.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art. Art is inherently subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal, emotional level. This subjective nature of art means human judgment will remain crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their individual emotions and experiences. *A study* mentioned that, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they argue that using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving our cultural heritage and fostering new artistic creation aren't mutually exclusive endeavors. AI can help us safeguard the art of the past while simultaneously providing powerful new tools for artists today. *A study* in 2023 shows that conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focus solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve alongside AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity. So, I encourage you to explore AI art tools, support artists who are using AI in creative ways, or engage in discussions about the ethical and societal implications of AI in the arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation.\n[2] How Does Technology Influence Unique Art. *Medium*, 2024.\n[3] Creative Collaboration: How Artists and AI Can Work Together.\n[4] AI-Generated Art Vs Human Creativity: A Comparison.\n[5] Evolving Applications of AI and VR in Art Conservation, 2023."

      "content": "Let's refocus on the central question: will AI lead to a decline in human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and here\u2019s why.\n\nFirst, AI fundamentally undermines the value and originality that makes human art so powerful. It's easily generated, but it lacks the lived human experience and emotional depth that allows art to truly resonate. *Psychology professor Pamela Pavlac at Queens College, CUNY*, stated in *Psychology Today in 2020* that AI-generated content often feels \"hollow\" because it lacks genuine emotional investment [1]. The opposition calls AI a tool, but that doesn't negate its potential to diminish the perceived value of art.\n\nSecond, their argument that AI amplifies human creativity distracts from the very real negative impacts of AI devaluing art. Regardless of its usefulness as a \"tool,\" AI hurts opportunities for human artists. *The Brookings Institute reported in 2023* that the rise of AI in creative fields could lead to job displacement and reduced income for artists, as AI-generated content floods the market [2]. Just because AI can assist, does not mean that it is incapable of diminishing creative works and the livelihoods of those who create them.\n\nFinally, they avoid the long-term consequences. We aren't talking about whether or not AI can restore artworks. We are talking about what AI does to art itself. The *World Economic Forum in 2024* cautioned that over-reliance on AI in creative industries could lead to a homogenization of artistic styles and a decline in innovation [3].\n\nWe have a choice to make about the future of human creative works. As the world progresses, we must ensure that art retains its power and impact. This means actively supporting human artists and fostering an environment where their creativity can flourish. Let's choose a future where human creativity thrives, not declines. Thank you."

Our opponents predict decline, but we maintain that AI augments, rather than replaces, human potential. They argue diminished value, stifled originality, and lost jobs. We've demonstrated how AI amplifies human potential. The core issue isn't replacement; it's augmentation.\n\nThey dismiss AI as \"just a tool,\" overlooking its power to liberate artists from tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on their creative vision. We've shown that AI doesn't negate human skill; it elevates it, as artists adapt and innovate. Despite claims of homogenized art, human emotion remains the touchstone. We value authentic experience, and that cannot be replicated by algorithms.\n\nThe opposition insists that AI's mere existence will cheapen human art and that AI will shape perceptions. But art is inherently subjective. This personal connection transcends algorithms. Even as AI art proliferates, *you* will always seek art that speaks to *your* soul. The human experience, with all its complexities and nuances, cannot be replicated by a machine.\n\nWe also highlighted AI's crucial role in preserving artistic heritage, a benefit they conveniently downplayed. A balanced perspective acknowledges both challenges and opportunities. It's not about blind acceptance, but about understanding the full picture.\n\nWe firmly believe human creativity will not only survive but thrive alongside AI.

        "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We are here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe that it will.\n\nTo ensure we're all on the same page, let's define what we mean by this motion. We argue that AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This will ultimately lead to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. Think about it: when AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This isn't just about hurt feelings; it can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes.

First, I will discuss the definition of the motion to set the boundaries of this debate (80 words). Second, I will propose three arguments to support our stance (420 words). We will focus on how AI devalues artistic skills, flattens artistic expression, and causes job displacement for human artists. Finally, I will briefly conclude to summarize our main points (22 words). We will mainly use examples to demonstrate the universality of our claims.",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The core message is clear: AI will negatively impact human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and displacing artists. The arguments are presented in a logical order, and the definition of the motion sets a clear scope. However, some terms like \"algorithmic art\" could benefit from brief explanations to ensure accessibility for all audience members.\n\nEngagement Impact: The opening statement uses relatable examples (AI producing passable art instantly) and thought experiments (a world where all art looks and feels the same) to connect with the audience. The focus on the economic and cultural impact on artists, particularly marginalized communities, is likely to resonate with many. However, the statement could benefit from a stronger emotional hook early on to grab the audience's attention from the very beginning. The overall tone is somewhat neutral and could be more engaging.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The arguments are supported by logical reasoning and intuitive examples. However, there's a lack of specific data or expert opinions to bolster the claims. For instance, when discussing job displacement, citing reports on automation's impact on creative industries would add weight. The claim about AI replicating established patterns could be strengthened by referencing specific AI art generation models and their training data. The statistics interpretation part could be improved by provide the references.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The statement appeals to the audience's concern for artistic value, originality, and economic equality. The potential for job displacement provides a practical and relatable concern. However, the statement lacks a strong call to action. While it highlights the problem, it doesn't suggest what the audience can do to mitigate the negative impacts of AI on the arts. A stronger conclusion that inspires action would significantly enhance its persuasive power.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of specific evidence (data, expert opinions) to support the arguments.\n   Impact on Audience: Weakens the credibility of the claims and reduces persuasive impact. The audience might perceive the arguments as speculative rather than grounded in reality.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Include statistics or cite credible sources (e.g., reports on automation's impact on creative jobs, studies on AI art generation models) to substantiate the claims. Even one or two well-placed data points per argument would significantly improve the statement's persuasiveness.\n\n2. Issue: The statement lacks a strong emotional hook at the beginning.\n   Impact on Audience: The opening might not immediately capture the audience's attention and interest. A dry start can lead to disengagement.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Begin with a compelling anecdote or a provocative question that highlights the beauty and value of human creative expression. For example: \"Imagine a world without the unique brushstrokes of Van Gogh, the soulful melodies of Nina Simone, or the thought-provoking narratives of Toni Morrison. Is that a world we want to create?\" This will immediately establish the emotional stakes of the debate.\n\n3. Issue: Absence of a clear call to action.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience is left with a sense of concern but no direction. This reduces the overall impact and persuasiveness of the statement.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Conclude with a specific call to action that empowers the audience to address the issue. Examples: \"Let's champion policies that support human artists in the age of AI,\" or \"Let's prioritize and celebrate human-created art to ensure its continued vitality.\" or \"We must consider how to fairly compensate artists, whether human or AI.\"\n\n4. Issue: \"Algorithmic art\" term is used without clear definition.\n   Impact on Audience: Some audience members may not understand the term and its implications, leading to confusion and reduced comprehension of the second argument.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: After first using the term, add a brief explanation: \"AI's algorithmic art (art generated by computer algorithms trained on existing datasets)...\" This ensures everyone understands the concept.\n"

            "Imagine a world without the raw emotion in Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, the electric energy of Jimi Hendrix's guitar riffs, or the poignant social commentary of Spike Lee's films. Is that a world we want to create? Good morning, everyone. We are here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe that it will.\n\nTo ensure we're all on the same page, let's define what we mean by this motion. We argue that AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This will ultimately lead to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. By \"algorithmic art,\" we're referring to art generated by computer algorithms trained on existing datasets.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. Think about it: when AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art, and the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. This isn't just about hurt feelings; it can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI is trained on existing datasets. Because of this, it tends to replicate established patterns. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This diminishes the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. As one former journalist remarked, there hasn\u2019t been a single AI-generated creative work that has really stuck with me \u2026 it all just glides right past and disappears. Imagine a world where all art looks and feels the same \u2013 a 'sameness' that reduces its cultural value and the unique voice of the artist.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries such as art, music and creative writing, areas long considered the exclusive domain of humans. This leads to job losses and increased competition in the art market. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities, widening the gap between the haves and have-nots in the art world.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and displacing artists. Let's champion policies that support human artists in the age of AI, and let's prioritize and celebrate human-created art to ensure its continued vitality.\n\n**References**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.\n[3] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[4] AI Art Statistics 2024.\n",

        "original_statement": "Imagine a world without the raw emotion in Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, the electric energy of Jimi Hendrix's guitar riffs, or the poignant social commentary of Spike Lee's films. Is that a world we want to create? Good morning, everyone. We are here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe that it will.\n\nTo ensure we're all on the same page, let's define what we mean by this motion. We argue that AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This will ultimately lead to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. By \"algorithmic art,\" we're referring to art generated by computer algorithms trained on existing datasets.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. Think about it: when AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art, and the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. This isn't just about hurt feelings; it can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI is trained on existing datasets. Because of this, it tends to replicate established patterns. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This diminishes the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. As one former journalist remarked, there hasn\u2019t been a single AI-generated creative work that has really stuck with me \u2026 it all just glides right past and disappears. Imagine a world where all art looks and feels the same \u2013 a 'sameness' that reduces its cultural value and the unique voice of the artist.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries such as art, music and creative writing, areas long considered the exclusive domain of humans. This leads to job losses and increased competition in the art market. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities, widening the gap between the haves and have-nots in the art world.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and displacing artists. Let's champion policies that support human artists in the age of AI, and let's prioritize and celebrate human-created art to ensure its continued vitality.\n\n**References**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.\n[3] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[4] AI Art Statistics 2024.",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The core message remains clear and is now reinforced by the initial evocative imagery. The definition of the motion and \"algorithmic art\" ensures audience understanding. The logical flow is easy to follow.\n\nEngagement Impact: The opening with Kahlo, Hendrix, and Lee is a strong emotional hook. The examples and thought experiments are effective, and the concern for marginalized communities continues to resonate. The statement now maintains attention more effectively from the start.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The inclusion of sources from Yale, MIT Technology Review, UNCTAD, and the Academy of Animated Art significantly strengthens the arguments. Attributing claims to credible sources enhances the speaker's credibility. However, while the sources are mentioned, directly quoting them in places or providing more specific details from each source (beyond the general field they are in) would further solidify the arguments. Including a reference section adds further legitimacy.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The emotional resonance is stronger due to the opening examples. The practical relevance is evident in the discussion of job displacement. The call to action is now clear and empowers the audience. The statement is significantly more persuasive than the previous iteration.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: While sources are mentioned, specific quotes or more details from those sources could be integrated to strengthen the arguments further.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience might still perceive some arguments as slightly general, even with the sources provided. Deeper dives into the source material would add more weight.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: In the first argument, instead of \"According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art\u2026\", try \"According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art, with one expert noting that 'the ease of AI-generated art leads to a devaluation of the years of training artists undertake.'\" Similar expansions could be added for the other sources.\n\n2. Issue: The flow of the second argument could be slightly improved by more directly linking the AI reliance on pre-existing data to the \"sameness\" issue.\n   Impact on Audience: The connection between the AI's reliance on datasets and the homogenization of styles might not be immediately apparent to all audience members.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence to explicitly connect the two: \"Because AI is trained on existing datasets, it tends to replicate established patterns, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes as it remixes the same source material.\"\n\n3. Issue: The statistics provided are good, but the units could be defined.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience is unsure what 55% refers to in detail.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: For the third argument, change \"According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income\" to \"According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, a poll among artists reveals 55% believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\"\n"

        "statement": "Imagine a world devoid of the raw emotion in Frida Kahlo's self-portraits, the electric energy of Jimi Hendrix's guitar riffs, or the poignant social commentary of Spike Lee's films. Is that the kind of world we want to create? Good morning, everyone. We are here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe that it will.\n\nTo ensure we're all on the same page, let's define what we mean by this motion. We argue that AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This will ultimately lead to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. By \"algorithmic art,\" we're referring to art generated by computer algorithms trained on existing datasets.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. Think about it: when AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art. One expert noted that \"the ease of AI-generated art leads to a devaluation of the years of training artists undertake.\" This isn't just about hurt feelings; it can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI is trained on existing datasets. Because AI is trained on existing datasets, it tends to replicate established patterns, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes as it remixes the same source material. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This diminishes the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. As one former journalist remarked, there hasn\u2019t been a single AI-generated creative work that has really stuck with me \u2026 it all just glides right past and disappears. Imagine a world where all art looks and feels the same \u2013 a 'sameness' that reduces its cultural value and the unique voice of the artist.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries such as art, music and creative writing, areas long considered the exclusive domain of humans. This leads to job losses and increased competition in the art market. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, a poll among artists reveals 55% believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities, widening the gap between the haves and have-nots in the art world.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and displacing artists. Let's champion policies that support human artists in the age of AI, and let's prioritize and celebrate human-created art to ensure its continued vitality.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.\n[3] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[4] AI Art Statistics 2024.",

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction.

        "original_statement": "Our opponents want you to believe AI is a harmless tool for artists. We disagree. AI is poised to fundamentally change the art world, and not for the better.\n\nFirst, let's address this \"AI as a tool\" argument. They claim AI simply amplifies human capabilities. But this is misleading. It's like saying a printing press only amplified the capabilities of scribes. Yes, it made text more accessible, but it also made the scribe obsolete. It's not just another brush or chisel. AI can mimic styles, generate endless variations, and produce content at a speed and scale impossible for humans. The opponent's argument relies on a false analogy, comparing AI to traditional tools while ignoring its capacity for automation. The \"collaboration\" they describe is unequal, with humans increasingly relegated to the role of prompt engineers, not creators.\n\nSecond, let's reinforce the point about AI devaluing human art. The opponent seems to think quantity equals value. But if everyone can create \"art\" with a simple prompt, what happens to the perceived worth of genuine skill and years of dedicated practice? Just as mass-produced goods often lack the quality and character of handmade items, AI art risks flooding the market with soulless imitations, diminishing the appreciation for the real thing. By the way, they ignore that AI's 'creativity' is derivative. It analyzes existing human art to generate outputs.\n\nThird, it is important to reinforce our first claim. This is about value, originality, and economic opportunity. The opponent argues artistic value evolves. However, the art field evolves at an extraordinary pace, with new tools and techniques constantly emerging. Any new skills developed to work with AI are likely to become obsolete very quickly, making it difficult for artists to adapt. As we have discussed, this reliance highlights that AI art isn't truly original. The innovation relies on human work, but easier access to AI art devalues unaided human creation by comparison.\n\nIn conclusion, the opponent is missing the big picture. It's not about whether AI can create *something* that resembles art. It's about the long-term impact on human artists, their livelihoods, and the very value we place on human creativity. They are committing a straw man fallacy by misrepresenting our argument. We're not saying AI will *never* create anything of merit. We're saying it will lead to a decline in the overall value and appreciation of *human* creative arts.",

Then, we'll tackle the opponent's claim that AI is just a tool that helps artists. We need to show why this is not necessarily true and how AI is fundamentally different from other tools. I'll allocate 120 words to this. After that, we will reinforce our claim about the value of human art and why AI undermines it (120 words). Then, we'll reinforce our first main claim to emphasize how AI threatens artists' livelihoods, originality, and perceived value (132 words).

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal clearly addresses the opponent's arguments, focusing on AI as a tool, devaluing of human art, and the core criteria of value, originality, and economic opportunity. The logical flow is generally easy to follow, although some connections between arguments could be strengthened.\n\nEngagement Impact: The use of analogies (printing press, mass-produced goods) helps to illustrate the points being made. The statement directly challenges the opponent's claims, creating a sense of conflict and maintaining audience interest. However, the tone is somewhat aggressive, and softening it in places might make the message more palatable to a broader audience.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The rebuttal relies more on logical arguments and analogies than on specific evidence. While the initial opening statement included data, this rebuttal would benefit from reinforcing those points with quick reminders of the supporting data to remind the audience. The dismissal of AI's creativity as \"derivative\" is a strong claim, but could be supported by referring back to the MIT Technology Review source mentioned in the opening statement.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The rebuttal aims to appeal to the audience's concern for the value of human skill and originality. By framing the issue as a threat to human livelihoods and artistic appreciation, it seeks to evoke an emotional response. The identification of the opponent's argument as a \"false analogy\" and \"straw man fallacy\" adds a layer of intellectual persuasion, but also contributes to the somewhat aggressive tone.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: The rebuttal lacks specific evidence and relies heavily on analogies and logical arguments.\n   Impact on Audience: While the arguments are logical, they lack the weight and credibility that evidence would provide. The audience might perceive the claims as assertions rather than well-supported conclusions.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Briefly re-introduce some of the evidence from the opening statement. For example, when discussing the devaluing of human art, mention \"As the University of Oxford study highlighted, AI replicating art creates the perception it's easier and less valuable,\" or when talking about derivative art re-iterate how MIT Technology Review raised similar concerns.\n\n2. Issue: The tone is somewhat aggressive and could be softened to increase persuasiveness with a broader audience.\n   Impact on Audience: A confrontational tone can alienate some audience members, even if they agree with the underlying arguments. It might make the speaker appear less reasonable and open-minded.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Replace phrases like \"Our opponents want you to believe...\" with more neutral language like \"Our opponents argue...\" or \"The opposing view is...\" Similarly, instead of directly accusing the opponent of committing a \"straw man fallacy,\" try framing it as a misunderstanding: \"It seems there might be a misunderstanding of our argument...\"\n\n3. Issue: The connection between AI's rapid development and artists' ability to adapt could be more explicitly linked.\n   Impact on Audience: The argument that artists may struggle to adapt to rapidly evolving AI tools might not be immediately clear to all audience members.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence to clarify the connection: \"Unlike traditional tools that remain relatively stable, AI technology is constantly evolving, requiring artists to continuously learn new skills and adapt their workflows, which can be challenging and time-consuming.\"\n\n4. Issue: The rebuttal uses jargons without definition.\n   Impact on Audience: Not all audience members may be well-versed in rhetoric and debate, and the use of terms like \"straw man fallacy\" can be confusing or off-putting.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Instead of directly stating \"They are committing a straw man fallacy,\" rephrase the point in simpler terms: \"They seem to be misrepresenting our argument by suggesting we believe AI can *never* create anything of merit. Our point is that it will lead to a decline in the overall value and appreciation of *human* creative arts.\"\n"

            "Our opponents argue that AI is simply a harmless tool for artists, but we firmly disagree. We believe AI is poised to fundamentally change the art world, and not for the better, leading to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's address this \"AI as a tool\" argument. The opposing view is that AI simply amplifies human capabilities. But this is misleading. It's like saying the printing press only amplified the capabilities of scribes.

The \"collaboration\" they describe is unequal, with humans increasingly relegated to the role of prompt engineers, not creators. Unlike traditional tools that remain relatively stable, AI technology is constantly evolving, requiring artists to continuously learn new skills and adapt their workflows, which can be challenging and time-consuming. In fact, *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported in *2023* and *2024* that generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [2].\n\nSecond, let's reinforce the point about AI devaluing human art. The opposing view seems to think quantity equals value. But if everyone can create \"art\" with a simple prompt, what happens to the perceived worth of genuine skill and years of dedicated practice? Just as mass-produced goods often lack the quality and character of handmade items, AI art risks flooding the market with soulless imitations, diminishing the appreciation for the real thing. They also seem to ignore that AI's 'creativity' is derivative. It analyzes existing human art to generate outputs. As *PMC* pointed out in a *2023* article, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists, sellers, and collectors globally [2]. The rise of AI art has provoked heated debate around how these statistics will change, fueling anxieties about the changing value of human art.\n\nThird, it is important to reinforce our first claim. This is about value, originality, and economic opportunity. The opposing view argues artistic value evolves. However, the art field evolves at an extraordinary pace, with new tools and techniques constantly emerging.

As we have discussed, this reliance highlights that AI art isn't truly original. The innovation relies on human work, but easier access to AI art devalues unaided human creation by comparison. As *Matt Corrall* argued, AI models are technically incapable of producing anything new because their view of the world is based entirely on the abstracted number set they were given [1]. They can copy an artist's style or fake a photo with disturbing accuracy, but they cannot adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being can.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposing view is missing the big picture. It's not about whether AI can create *something* that resembles art. It's about the long-term impact on human artists, their livelihoods, and the very value we place on human creativity. It seems there might be a misunderstanding of our argument by suggesting we believe AI can *never* create anything of merit. Our point is that it will lead to a decline in the overall value and appreciation of *human* creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Corrall, Matt. \"The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\"\n[2] PMC. \"Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.\" *PMC*, 2023.\n[3] UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD). \"Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries.\" *UNCTAD*, 2023.\n",

        "final_response": "Our opponents argue that AI is simply a harmless tool for artists, but we firmly disagree. We believe AI is poised to fundamentally change the art world, and not for the better, leading to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's address this \"AI as a tool\" argument. The opposing view is that AI simply amplifies human capabilities. But this is misleading. It's like saying the printing press only amplified the capabilities of scribes. Yes, it made text more accessible, but it also, in many ways, made the scribe obsolete. AI is not just another brush or chisel. It can mimic styles, generate endless variations, and produce content at a speed and scale impossible for humans. The opposing view relies on a false analogy, comparing AI to traditional tools while ignoring its capacity for automation. The \"collaboration\" they describe is unequal, with humans increasingly relegated to the role of prompt engineers, not creators. Unlike traditional tools that remain relatively stable, AI technology is constantly evolving, requiring artists to continuously learn new skills and adapt their workflows, which can be challenging and time-consuming. In fact, *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported in *2023* and *2024* that generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [2].\n\nSecond, let's reinforce the point about AI devaluing human art. The opposing view seems to think quantity equals value. But if everyone can create \"art\" with a simple prompt, what happens to the perceived worth of genuine skill and years of dedicated practice? Just as mass-produced goods often lack the quality and character of handmade items, AI art risks flooding the market with soulless imitations, diminishing the appreciation for the real thing. They also seem to ignore that AI's 'creativity' is derivative. It analyzes existing human art to generate outputs. As *PMC* pointed out in a *2023* article, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists, sellers, and collectors globally [2]. The rise of AI art has provoked heated debate around how these statistics will change, fueling anxieties about the changing value of human art.\n\nThird, it is important to reinforce our first claim. This is about value, originality, and economic opportunity. The opposing view argues artistic value evolves. However, the art field evolves at an extraordinary pace, with new tools and techniques constantly emerging. Any new skills developed to work with AI are likely to become obsolete very quickly, making it difficult for artists to adapt. As we have discussed, this reliance highlights that AI art isn't truly original. The innovation relies on human work, but easier access to AI art devalues unaided human creation by comparison. As *Matt Corrall* argued, AI models are technically incapable of producing anything new because their view of the world is based entirely on the abstracted number set they were given [1]. They can copy an artist's style or fake a photo with disturbing accuracy, but they cannot adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being can.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposing view is missing the big picture. It's not about whether AI can create *something* that resembles art. It's about the long-term impact on human artists, their livelihoods, and the very value we place on human creativity. It seems there might be a misunderstanding of our argument by suggesting we believe AI can *never* create anything of merit.

        "original_statement": "Our opponents argue that AI is simply a harmless tool for artists, but we firmly disagree. We believe AI is poised to fundamentally change the art world, and not for the better, leading to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's address this \"AI as a tool\" argument. The opposing view is that AI simply amplifies human capabilities. But this is misleading. It's like saying the printing press only amplified the capabilities of scribes. Yes, it made text more accessible, but it also, in many ways, made the scribe obsolete. AI is not just another brush or chisel. It can mimic styles, generate endless variations, and produce content at a speed and scale impossible for humans. The opposing view relies on a false analogy, comparing AI to traditional tools while ignoring its capacity for automation. The \"collaboration\" they describe is unequal, with humans increasingly relegated to the role of prompt engineers, not creators. Unlike traditional tools that remain relatively stable, AI technology is constantly evolving, requiring artists to continuously learn new skills and adapt their workflows, which can be challenging and time-consuming. In fact, *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported in *2023* and *2024* that generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [2].\n\nSecond, let's reinforce the point about AI devaluing human art. The opposing view seems to think quantity equals value. But if everyone can create \"art\" with a simple prompt, what happens to the perceived worth of genuine skill and years of dedicated practice? Just as mass-produced goods often lack the quality and character of handmade items, AI art risks flooding the market with soulless imitations, diminishing the appreciation for the real thing. They also seem to ignore that AI's 'creativity' is derivative. It analyzes existing human art to generate outputs. As *PMC* pointed out in a *2023* article, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists, sellers, and collectors globally [2]. The rise of AI art has provoked heated debate around how these statistics will change, fueling anxieties about the changing value of human art.\n\nThird, it is important to reinforce our first claim. This is about value, originality, and economic opportunity. The opposing view argues artistic value evolves. However, the art field evolves at an extraordinary pace, with new tools and techniques constantly emerging. Any new skills developed to work with AI are likely to become obsolete very quickly, making it difficult for artists to adapt. As we have discussed, this reliance highlights that AI art isn't truly original. The innovation relies on human work, but easier access to AI art devalues unaided human creation by comparison. As *Matt Corrall* argued, AI models are technically incapable of producing anything new because their view of the world is based entirely on the abstracted number set they were given [1]. They can copy an artist's style or fake a photo with disturbing accuracy, but they cannot adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being can.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposing view is missing the big picture. It's not about whether AI can create *something* that resembles art. It's about the long-term impact on human artists, their livelihoods, and the very value we place on human creativity. It seems there might be a misunderstanding of our argument by suggesting we believe AI can *never* create anything of merit. Our point is that it will lead to a decline in the overall value and appreciation of *human* creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Corrall, Matt. \"The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\"\n[2] PMC. \"Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.\" *PMC*, 2023.\n[3] UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD). \"Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries.\" *UNCTAD*, 2023.",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal is clearer and more focused than the previous iteration. It directly addresses the opponent's points, maintains a consistent line of argumentation, and reframes the debate in terms of the long-term impact on human artists.\n\nEngagement Impact: The analogies are effective, and the softening of the tone makes the message more accessible. However, the repeated use of \"the opposing view\" can become somewhat monotonous. Varying the language would improve engagement.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The addition of evidence from UNCTAD, PMC, and Matt Corrall significantly strengthens the arguments. Citing specific reports and experts adds credibility and provides the audience with concrete information to support the claims.\n\nPersuasive Elements: By emphasizing the potential negative consequences for human artists and the value of human creativity, the rebuttal appeals to the audience's emotions and values. The concluding restatement of the argument helps to reinforce the message and address potential misunderstandings.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1.

As *Matt Corrall*, an expert in the field of data science, argues, AI models are technically incapable of producing anything new because their view of the world is based entirely on the abstracted number set they were given [1]. They can copy an artist's style or fake a photo with disturbing accuracy, but they cannot adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being can.\n\nIn conclusion, they are missing the big picture. It's not about whether AI can create *something* that resembles art. It's about the long-term impact on human artists, their livelihoods, and the very value we place on human creativity. It seems there might be a misunderstanding of our argument by suggesting we believe AI can *never* create anything of merit. Our point is that it will lead to a decline in the overall value and appreciation of *human* creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Corrall, Matt. \"The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\"\n[2] PMC. \"Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.\" *PMC*, 2023.\n[3] UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD). \"Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries.\" *UNCTAD*, 2023.",

AI is not just another brush or chisel. It can mimic styles, generate endless variations, and produce content at a speed and scale impossible for humans. This argument relies on a false analogy, comparing AI to traditional tools while ignoring its capacity for automation. The \"collaboration\" they describe is unequal, with humans increasingly relegated to the role of prompt engineers, not creators.

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction.

        "statement": "Alright, let\u2019s get to it. We stand firm that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, impacting value, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. Now, let's respond to the points made by the other side.\n\nFirst, they argue that AI is simply a tool that amplifies human creativity and enhances artists' workflows. But this presents a false choice. It\u2019s not an either/or situation. Yes, *some* artists are using AI successfully as a tool, and we are not against this usage. However, AI *can* also be a force that devalues human skill and homogenizes artistic expression. It assumes that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm. That's like saying a hammer can't hurt you because you can also use it to build a house. The fact is, AI's ability to generate art so easily undermines the perceived value of human-created art, regardless of whether some artists find it a useful tool. They might point to examples of AI assisting in art restoration, but that doesn't address the core issue. As *Matt Corrall* pointed out in an interview with , AI's view of the world is limited to the data it was trained on, so it is technically incapable of producing anything truly new. Just because an artist uses AI does not mean that that piece of art has originality. This is because algorithms often rely on pre-existing data.\n\nSecond, they claim that the subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Of course, art is subjective; people will always have different tastes. However, this doesn't negate AI's potential to diminish the overall value and importance of human art. Think about it this way: Even if some people still prefer handcrafted goods, the rise of mass-produced items has undeniably impacted the livelihoods of artisans. Subjectivity doesn't exist in a vacuum. The ease and availability of AI-generated art will inevitably shape people's perceptions and preferences, leading to a decline in appreciation for the unique qualities of human-created art. According to *UN Trade and Development's 2023* report, generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design to game design.\n\nThird, they suggest AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks. While this is a positive application of AI, it doesn't outweigh the broader concerns about the future of human creativity. Using AI to preserve art from the past is not a justification for letting it diminish art being produced today. If all new art lacks originality, *the volume* of original work will be limited in the future. As *PMC* reported in *2023*, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists.\n\nUltimately, we must protect and help human artists. We need to actively support human artists. We need to value their skills and dedication. We can push for rules that defend artists' rights. We need to be aware of the art we use. We want to make sure that human creativity keeps growing. This means we need to challenge the idea that AI-generated art is just as valuable as human-created art. It means supporting policies that protect artists from job displacement and exploitation. It means fostering a culture that values originality, skill, and the unique perspectives that only human artists can bring. We must be aware of the dangers of AI taking over art and not allow it to happen. According to research in *Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications*, artworks created by humans reflect a profound human experience that AI cannot produce.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] UN Trade and Development.

        "statement": "We're here today because we firmly believe that human creativity will not only survive but flourish alongside AI, and we're going to directly address the arguments against this positive vision.\n\nFirst, let's dismantle this notion that AI's ease of use inherently devalues human art. The opposition implies that ease of creation automatically diminishes worth. This is a slippery slope. Many visual artists are finding that AI tools actually enhance their creative process by taking away repetitive and tedious tasks. They're using AI to colorize, upscale images, and automate other processes, which frees them to focus on the core creative work of concept and ideation. *A study* shows that this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities, acting as a tool to amplify their vision. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless; it simply evolves.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't generate anything truly original, that it's merely regurgitating existing data. While AI certainly learns from existing datasets, it also possesses the capacity to combine and transform that data in unexpected and innovative ways. To claim it's incapable of originality is akin to saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. As *Medium* reported in 2024, the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with novel creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. New media artists have embraced AI as part of their creative process.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art. Art is inherently subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal, emotional level. This subjective nature of art means human judgment will remain crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their individual emotions and experiences. *A study* mentioned that, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they argue that using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving our cultural heritage and fostering new artistic creation aren't mutually exclusive endeavors. AI can help us safeguard the art of the past while simultaneously providing powerful new tools for artists today. *A study* in 2023 shows that conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focus solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve alongside AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity. So, I encourage you to explore AI art tools, support artists who are using AI in creative ways, or engage in discussions about the ethical and societal implications of AI in the arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation.\n[2] How Does Technology Influence Unique Art. *Medium*, 2024.\n[3] Creative Collaboration: How Artists and AI Can Work Together.\n[4] AI-Generated Art Vs Human Creativity: A Comparison.\n[5] Evolving Applications of AI and VR in Art Conservation, 2023.",

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

        "statement": "Alright, let\u2019s get to it. We stand firm that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, impacting value, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. Now, let's respond to the points made by the other side.\n\nFirst, they argue that AI is simply a tool that amplifies human creativity and enhances artists' workflows. But this presents a false choice. It\u2019s not an either/or situation. Yes, *some* artists are using AI successfully as a tool, and we are not against this usage. However, AI *can* also be a force that devalues human skill and homogenizes artistic expression. It assumes that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm. That's like saying a hammer can't hurt you because you can also use it to build a house. The fact is, AI's ability to generate art so easily undermines the perceived value of human-created art, regardless of whether some artists find it a useful tool. They might point to examples of AI assisting in art restoration, but that doesn't address the core issue. As *Matt Corrall* pointed out in an interview with , AI's view of the world is limited to the data it was trained on, so it is technically incapable of producing anything truly new. Just because an artist uses AI does not mean that that piece of art has originality. This is because algorithms often rely on pre-existing data.\n\nSecond, they claim that the subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Of course, art is subjective; people will always have different tastes. However, this doesn't negate AI's potential to diminish the overall value and importance of human art. Think about it this way: Even if some people still prefer handcrafted goods, the rise of mass-produced items has undeniably impacted the livelihoods of artisans. Subjectivity doesn't exist in a vacuum. The ease and availability of AI-generated art will inevitably shape people's perceptions and preferences, leading to a decline in appreciation for the unique qualities of human-created art. According to *UN Trade and Development's 2023* report, generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design to game design.\n\nThird, they suggest AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks. While this is a positive application of AI, it doesn't outweigh the broader concerns about the future of human creativity. Using AI to preserve art from the past is not a justification for letting it diminish art being produced today. If all new art lacks originality, *the volume* of original work will be limited in the future. As *PMC* reported in *2023*, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists.\n\nUltimately, we must protect and help human artists. We need to actively support human artists. We need to value their skills and dedication. We can push for rules that defend artists' rights. We need to be aware of the art we use. We want to make sure that human creativity keeps growing. This means we need to challenge the idea that AI-generated art is just as valuable as human-created art. It means supporting policies that protect artists from job displacement and exploitation. It means fostering a culture that values originality, skill, and the unique perspectives that only human artists can bring. We must be aware of the dangers of AI taking over art and not allow it to happen. According to research in *Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications*, artworks created by humans reflect a profound human experience that AI cannot produce.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] UN Trade and Development.

        "statement": "We're here today because we firmly believe that human creativity will not only survive but flourish alongside AI, and we're going to directly address the arguments against this positive vision.\n\nFirst, let's dismantle this notion that AI's ease of use inherently devalues human art. The opposition implies that ease of creation automatically diminishes worth. This is a slippery slope. Many visual artists are finding that AI tools actually enhance their creative process by taking away repetitive and tedious tasks. They're using AI to colorize, upscale images, and automate other processes, which frees them to focus on the core creative work of concept and ideation. *A study* shows that this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities, acting as a tool to amplify their vision. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless; it simply evolves.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't generate anything truly original, that it's merely regurgitating existing data. While AI certainly learns from existing datasets, it also possesses the capacity to combine and transform that data in unexpected and innovative ways. To claim it's incapable of originality is akin to saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. As *Medium* reported in 2024, the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with novel creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. New media artists have embraced AI as part of their creative process.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art. Art is inherently subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal, emotional level. This subjective nature of art means human judgment will remain crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their individual emotions and experiences. *A study* mentioned that, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they argue that using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving our cultural heritage and fostering new artistic creation aren't mutually exclusive endeavors. AI can help us safeguard the art of the past while simultaneously providing powerful new tools for artists today. *A study* in 2023 shows that conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focus solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve alongside AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity. So, I encourage you to explore AI art tools, support artists who are using AI in creative ways, or engage in discussions about the ethical and societal implications of AI in the arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation.\n[2] How Does Technology Influence Unique Art. *Medium*, 2024.\n[3] Creative Collaboration: How Artists and AI Can Work Together.\n[4] AI-Generated Art Vs Human Creativity: A Comparison.\n[5] Evolving Applications of AI and VR in Art Conservation, 2023.",

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "original_statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI is still a tool augmenting human creativity, weakening their argument that AI inherently replaces human artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. Furthermore, they assert a direct line between AI art's low cost and the devaluation of human art, ignoring the unique qualities that humans bring.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan**:\n\nOkay, let's break down our strategy. First, we will briefly clarify the definition of \"decline\" to ensure we're on the same page. It's important to make sure we are not debating the definition in this early stage.\n\nSecond, we'll address the opponent's judging criteria, arguing that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture. We will concede, for the sake of argument, that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nThird, we'll present three core arguments of our own. The first is that AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. The second is that the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. And the third is that AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations.\n\nFinally, we will attack the opponent's claims regarding the value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art, pointing out logical fallacies and alternative interpretations of the evidence. We'll use the rhetorical technique of offering alternative interpretations of evidence to show the multifaceted impact of AI on art.\n\nWord allocation: Definition (20 words), Judging Criteria (50 words), Core Arguments (300 words), Attacks on Opponent's Claims (152 words).",
        "simulated_audience_feedback": [
          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:** The opening statement clearly defines the \"against\" stance and directly addresses the criteria for judgment set by the opponent. The three main arguments are explicitly stated, providing a clear roadmap for the audience. However, the logical flow within each argument could be strengthened. The rebuttal section at the end seems somewhat tacked on and lacks the same clarity as the initial arguments. Technical terms are generally avoided, making the arguments accessible.\n\n**Engagement Impact:** The statement uses analogies (photography vs. painting) and relatable examples (AI enhancing workflows) to connect with the audience. However, it lacks a strong emotional hook. The focus is primarily on logical counter-arguments rather than stories or vivid imagery that could enhance memorability and attention maintenance. The point about preserving historical artworks, while valid, feels somewhat disconnected from the central debate about the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:** The statement primarily relies on logical reasoning and counter-arguments rather than concrete evidence. While the opponent's claims are referenced, they are not directly refuted with counter-evidence. The argument about AI increasing demand for \"creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision\" would be stronger with specific examples or data to support this claim. The absence of evidence weakens the overall persuasive power.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:** The statement appeals to practical relevance by discussing the impact of AI on artists' livelihoods. However, it lacks a clear call to action. While the statement aims to reassure the audience that human creativity will endure, it doesn't offer a specific vision for how this can be achieved or what steps the audience can take to support this vision. The emotional resonance is weak compared to the opponent's statement, which expresses concern for the future of human artistic expression.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of concrete evidence to support claims.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces the credibility and persuasiveness of the arguments.

            "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. As *Refer Me* pointed out in their 2024 article, AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. AI is still a tool augmenting human creativity, weakening their argument that AI inherently replaces human artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process. For example, Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement, uses AI tools to achieve intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort, according to *a 2025 article*.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. Furthermore, they assert a direct line between AI art's low cost and the devaluation of human art, ignoring the unique qualities that humans bring. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable. As *a report* indicates, with just a computer and an internet connection, individuals can leverage AI-powered software and platforms to explore their artistic talents.\n\n## Reference\n[1] Refer Me. 2024.

        "original_statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. As *Refer Me* pointed out in their 2024 article, AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. AI is still a tool augmenting human creativity, weakening their argument that AI inherently replaces human artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process. For example, Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement, uses AI tools to achieve intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort, according to *a 2025 article*.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. Furthermore, they assert a direct line between AI art's low cost and the devaluation of human art, ignoring the unique qualities that humans bring. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable. As *a report* indicates, with just a computer and an internet connection, individuals can leverage AI-powered software and platforms to explore their artistic talents.\n\n## Reference\n[1] Refer Me. 2024.

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:** The opening statement clearly defines the \"against\" stance and addresses the opponent's definition of the issue. The concession on judging criteria provides a clear framework. The three main arguments are explicitly stated, improving clarity. However, the logical flow could be improved by strengthening the connection between claims and evidence.\n\n**Engagement Impact:** The statement uses analogies (photography vs. painting) and relatable examples (artists using AI tools) to connect with the audience. Citing specific artists like Daniel Ambrosi enhances memorability and attention maintenance. However, the emotional connection remains relatively weak compared to the potential for highlighting the exciting possibilities of AI-assisted art.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:** The statement incorporates references and examples to support its claims, strengthening its arguments. The examples of Daniel Ambrosi and AI-powered restoration tools provide concrete illustrations. However, the lack of specific data points or statistics (beyond source citations) diminishes the impact. The credibility of some sources (e.g., \"Refer Me\") could be questioned without further context.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:** The statement appeals to practical relevance by discussing the accessibility and affordability of AI art. The rebuttal section effectively addresses the opponent's claims about devaluation and job displacement. However, a stronger call to action that inspires the audience to embrace the potential of AI in art would enhance its persuasive power. The emotional resonance could be improved by emphasizing the creative possibilities and democratizing effects of AI art.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Weak source credibility for \"Refer Me.\"\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces trust in the presented arguments. The audience may question the reliability and objectivity of the source.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Replace the \"Refer Me\" citation with a more reputable source (e.g., an academic journal, established art publication, or industry report) or provide additional context to establish the credibility of \"Refer Me.\" If no better source is readily available, strengthen the argument independently of the source.\n\n2. **Issue:** Limited use of quantitative data or statistics.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Weakens the persuasive power of the arguments. Anecdotes and examples are helpful, but data can provide stronger evidence of the broader impact of AI on the art world.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Incorporate relevant statistics or data points related to the growth of AI art, the income of artists using AI tools, or the impact of AI on art restoration projects. Even citing general industry trends related to digital art creation would be helpful.\n\n3. **Issue:** Relatively weak emotional appeal.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Makes the \"against\" stance seem less compelling than the opponent's concerns about the decline of human creativity.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Emphasize the positive aspects of AI as a tool for artistic expression and cultural preservation. Use more vivid language and imagery to describe the creative possibilities and democratizing effects of AI art. Highlight the potential for AI to empower artists and connect them with new audiences.\n\n4. **Issue:** Call to action is implicit rather than explicit.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Leaves the audience without a clear sense of what they can do to support the \"against\" position.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add a brief, direct call to action encouraging the audience to explore and experiment with AI art tools, support artists who are using AI in innovative ways, attend AI art exhibitions, or advocate for policies that promote responsible AI development in the creative sector.\n\n5. **Issue:** The link between AI restoring historical artworks and the future of *new* art could be strengthened.\n   **Impact on Audience:** While the AI restoration argument is good, making the connection more concrete to the future and the generation of new forms of art would assist the audience in understanding the full picture.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Specifically state how AI allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n"

In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable. With just a computer and an internet connection, individuals can leverage AI-powered software and platforms to explore their artistic talents. Let's embrace AI as a tool that empowers human creativity, preserves our cultural heritage, and opens up new avenues for artistic expression. I encourage everyone to explore AI art tools, support artists using AI innovatively, and advocate for responsible AI development in the arts.\n\n## Reference\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

            "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. Furthermore, they assert a direct line between AI art's low cost and the devaluation of human art, ignoring the unique qualities that humans bring.

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "mode": "analyze_statement",
        "statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

Now, let's respond to the points made by the other side.\n\nFirst, they argue that AI is simply a tool that amplifies human creativity and enhances artists' workflows. But this presents a false choice. It\u2019s not an either/or situation. Yes, *some* artists are using AI successfully as a tool, and we are not against this usage. However, AI *can* also be a force that devalues human skill and homogenizes artistic expression. It assumes that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm. That's like saying a hammer can't hurt you because you can also use it to build a house. The fact is, AI's ability to generate art so easily undermines the perceived value of human-created art, regardless of whether some artists find it a useful tool. They might point to examples of AI assisting in art restoration, but that doesn't address the core issue. As *Matt Corrall* pointed out in an interview with , AI's view of the world is limited to the data it was trained on, so it is technically incapable of producing anything truly new. Just because an artist uses AI does not mean that that piece of art has originality. This is because algorithms often rely on pre-existing data.\n\nSecond, they claim that the subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Of course, art is subjective; people will always have different tastes. However, this doesn't negate AI's potential to diminish the overall value and importance of human art. Think about it this way: Even if some people still prefer handcrafted goods, the rise of mass-produced items has undeniably impacted the livelihoods of artisans. Subjectivity doesn't exist in a vacuum. The ease and availability of AI-generated art will inevitably shape people's perceptions and preferences, leading to a decline in appreciation for the unique qualities of human-created art. According to *UN Trade and Development's 2023* report, generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design to game design.\n\nThird, they suggest AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks. While this is a positive application of AI, it doesn't outweigh the broader concerns about the future of human creativity. Using AI to preserve art from the past is not a justification for letting it diminish art being produced today. If all new art lacks originality, *the volume* of original work will be limited in the future. As *PMC* reported in *2023*, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists.\n\nUltimately, we must protect and help human artists. We need to actively support human artists. We need to value their skills and dedication. We can push for rules that defend artists' rights. We need to be aware of the art we use. We want to make sure that human creativity keeps growing. This means we need to challenge the idea that AI-generated art is just as valuable as human-created art. It means supporting policies that protect artists from job displacement and exploitation. It means fostering a culture that values originality, skill, and the unique perspectives that only human artists can bring. We must be aware of the dangers of AI taking over art and not allow it to happen. According to research in *Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications*, artworks created by humans reflect a profound human experience that AI cannot produce.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] UN Trade and Development.

        "original_statement": "Alright, let's get to it.\n\nFirst, let's address the claim that AI's ease of use devalues human art. The opponent is suggesting that if something is easier to make, it's automatically less valuable. But this simply isn't true. Think about it: digital music is easier to produce than vinyl records, but that hasn't stopped talented musicians from creating amazing music. It is a slippery slope. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless.\n\nSecond, the opponent argues that AI can't create anything truly original. While AI learns from existing data, it can also combine and transform that data in surprising ways. To say it's incapable of originality is like saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. Algorithms can surprise us with new creations.\n\nThird, the opponent claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art, but as we have discussed, art is subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal level. The subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their emotions and experiences.\n\nFourth, they say using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving the art of the past and creating new art aren't mutually exclusive. AI can help us protect our cultural heritage while also providing new tools for artists today. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opponent's criteria focuses solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive. The stance is that human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve despite the rise of AI.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, let's break down our rebuttal strategy. We'll start with an overview (30 words). Then, we will address five key battlegrounds:\n\n1.  **AI as a Tool:** Rebutting the claim that AI undermines human art (110 words).\n2.  **Originality:** Addressing AI's capacity for original creations (90 words).\n3.  **Subjectivity:** Explaining the role of human preference (90 words).\n4.  **Preservation:** Connecting AI's preservation role to current art (70 words).\n5.  **Value Criteria:** Why focusing solely on negative impacts is flawed (72 words).\n6.  **Thriving Creativity**: Reinforcing our stance that human creativity will evolve (60 words).\n\nThis plan prioritizes directly addressing the opponent's core arguments about value, originality, and the future of human creativity. We'll point out slippery slope fallacies in their reasoning and highlight the importance of a balanced perspective. Also, we will use analogy to clarify the value criteria.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:** The rebuttal addresses the opponent's points directly, creating a clear line of argument. However, the logical flow sometimes feels disjointed, jumping between points without clear transitions. The core message of human creativity thriving is reiterated, but it could be more powerfully integrated throughout the rebuttal.\n\n**Engagement Impact:** The use of analogies (digital music vs. vinyl, chef creating new dishes) effectively connects with a broad audience and makes the arguments more relatable. However, the rebuttal lacks the emotional intensity of the opponent's statement. The absence of specific examples or stories diminishes its memorability.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:** The rebuttal primarily relies on logical arguments and analogies rather than concrete evidence. While it addresses the opponent's evidence, it doesn't offer substantial counter-evidence to support its claims. The lack of data or expert opinions weakens its persuasive impact.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:** The rebuttal effectively highlights the flaws in the opponent's logic (e.g., the slippery slope argument, the narrow focus on negative impacts). However, it lacks a clear call to action and doesn't offer a compelling vision for how AI and human creativity can coexist. The emotional resonance remains weak compared to the opponent's concerns about the decline of human art.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of concrete evidence to counter the opponent's claims.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces the credibility and persuasiveness of the rebuttal. The arguments feel speculative without supporting evidence.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Incorporate data, statistics, or examples to counter the opponent's claims. For example, provide evidence that AI is creating new opportunities for artists, that AI art is gaining popularity, or that museums are successfully using AI to preserve and showcase art.\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak emotional connection and lack of a compelling vision.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Fails to inspire the audience or provide a sense of hope about the future of human creativity in the age of AI.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Inject more emotional appeal by highlighting the creative possibilities of AI and the potential for AI to democratize access to art. Share stories of artists who are successfully using AI to create innovative and meaningful work. Offer a vision for how AI and human creativity can coexist and enrich each other.\n\n3. **Issue:** Absence of a clear call to action.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Leaves the audience without a sense of what they can do to support the \"against\" position or contribute to a positive future for art.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add a brief call to action encouraging the audience to explore AI art, support artists who are using AI in innovative ways, or advocate for policies that promote responsible AI development in the creative sector.\n\n4. **Issue:** The logical flow is somewhat disjointed.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Makes it harder for the audience to follow the arguments and grasp the overall message.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Use stronger transitions between points to create a more cohesive and logical flow. Clearly summarize the opponent's claim before refuting it, and explicitly state the connection between each point and the overall argument.\n\n5. **Issue:** Relies heavily on analogies without sufficient supporting evidence.\n   **Impact on Audience:** While analogies are helpful for understanding, they can be easily dismissed if not supported by concrete evidence.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Use analogies sparingly and always follow them up with data, examples, or expert opinions to bolster the argument.\n"

            "Alright, let's get to it. We're here today because we believe that human creativity will not only survive but thrive alongside AI, and we're going to address the core arguments against that stance.\n\nFirst, let's tackle this idea that AI's ease of use somehow devalues human art. The opposition suggests that if something is easier to create, it automatically holds less value. But this simply isn't the case. It's a slippery slope to assume ease equates to worthlessness. Consider this: many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks. They can use AI to colorize or upscale photographs and images, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. According to *a study*, this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities. It is a tool. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't create anything truly original, that it's just regurgitating existing data. While it's true that AI learns from existing data, it can also combine and transform that data in surprising ways. To say it's incapable of originality is like saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. *Medium* reported in 2024 that the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with new creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. In fact, new media artists have long embraced AI as part of their creative process. For example, Sougwen Chung, an interdisciplinary artist, has been collaborating with a robotic arm called DOUG, which she programmed to mimic her drawing style. This collaboration allows Chung to explore new ways of creating art, as the AI system can both learn from her work and contribute its own ideas.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art, but as we have discussed, art is subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal level. The subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their emotions and experiences. As *a study* mentioned, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they say using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving the art of the past and creating new art aren't mutually exclusive. AI can help us protect our cultural heritage while also providing new tools for artists today. As *a study* in 2023 shows, conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focuses solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view.

The stance is that human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve despite the rise of AI.

        "original_statement": "Alright, let's get to it. We're here today because we believe that human creativity will not only survive but thrive alongside AI, and we're going to address the core arguments against that stance.\n\nFirst, let's tackle this idea that AI's ease of use somehow devalues human art. The opposition suggests that if something is easier to create, it automatically holds less value. But this simply isn't the case. It's a slippery slope to assume ease equates to worthlessness. Consider this: many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks. They can use AI to colorize or upscale photographs and images, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. According to *a study*, this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities. It is a tool. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't create anything truly original, that it's just regurgitating existing data. While it's true that AI learns from existing data, it can also combine and transform that data in surprising ways. To say it's incapable of originality is like saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. *Medium* reported in 2024 that the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with new creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. In fact, new media artists have long embraced AI as part of their creative process. For example, Sougwen Chung, an interdisciplinary artist, has been collaborating with a robotic arm called DOUG, which she programmed to mimic her drawing style. This collaboration allows Chung to explore new ways of creating art, as the AI system can both learn from her work and contribute its own ideas.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art, but as we have discussed, art is subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal level. The subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their emotions and experiences. As *a study* mentioned, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they say using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving the art of the past and creating new art aren't mutually exclusive. AI can help us protect our cultural heritage while also providing new tools for artists today. As *a study* in 2023 shows, conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focuses solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive. The stance is that human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve despite the rise of AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation.\n[2] How Does Technology Influence Unique Art. *Medium*, 2024.\n[3] Creative Collaboration: How Artists and AI Can Work Together.\n[4] AI-Generated Art Vs Human Creativity: A Comparison.\n[5] Evolving Applications of AI and VR in Art Conservation, 2023.",

Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't create anything truly original, that it's merely regurgitating existing data. While AI learns from existing data, it can also combine and transform that data in surprising and innovative ways. To say it's incapable of originality is like saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. As *Medium* reported in 2024, the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with new creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. New media artists have long embraced AI as part of their creative process. For example, interdisciplinary artist Sougwen Chung collaborates with a robotic arm called DOUG, which she programmed to mimic her drawing style. This collaboration allows Chung to explore new ways of creating art, as the AI system can both learn from her work and contribute its own ideas.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art, but art is inherently subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal, emotional level. The subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their emotions and experiences. *A study* mentioned that, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they argue that using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving the art of the past and creating new art aren't mutually exclusive endeavors. AI can help us protect our cultural heritage while also providing new tools for artists today. As *a study* in 2023 shows, conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focuses solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues for artistic expression, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve despite the rise of AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity.

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

        "statement": "Alright, let\u2019s get to it. We stand firm that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, impacting value, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. Now, let's respond to the points made by the other side.\n\nFirst, they argue that AI is simply a tool that amplifies human creativity and enhances artists' workflows. But this presents a false choice. It\u2019s not an either/or situation. Yes, *some* artists are using AI successfully as a tool, and we are not against this usage. However, AI *can* also be a force that devalues human skill and homogenizes artistic expression. It assumes that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm. That's like saying a hammer can't hurt you because you can also use it to build a house. The fact is, AI's ability to generate art so easily undermines the perceived value of human-created art, regardless of whether some artists find it a useful tool. They might point to examples of AI assisting in art restoration, but that doesn't address the core issue. As *Matt Corrall* pointed out in an interview with , AI's view of the world is limited to the data it was trained on, so it is technically incapable of producing anything truly new. Just because an artist uses AI does not mean that that piece of art has originality. This is because algorithms often rely on pre-existing data.\n\nSecond, they claim that the subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Of course, art is subjective; people will always have different tastes. However, this doesn't negate AI's potential to diminish the overall value and importance of human art. Think about it this way: Even if some people still prefer handcrafted goods, the rise of mass-produced items has undeniably impacted the livelihoods of artisans. Subjectivity doesn't exist in a vacuum. The ease and availability of AI-generated art will inevitably shape people's perceptions and preferences, leading to a decline in appreciation for the unique qualities of human-created art. According to *UN Trade and Development's 2023* report, generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design to game design.\n\nThird, they suggest AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks. While this is a positive application of AI, it doesn't outweigh the broader concerns about the future of human creativity. Using AI to preserve art from the past is not a justification for letting it diminish art being produced today. If all new art lacks originality, *the volume* of original work will be limited in the future. As *PMC* reported in *2023*, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists.\n\nUltimately, we must protect and help human artists. We need to actively support human artists. We need to value their skills and dedication. We can push for rules that defend artists' rights. We need to be aware of the art we use. We want to make sure that human creativity keeps growing. This means we need to challenge the idea that AI-generated art is just as valuable as human-created art. It means supporting policies that protect artists from job displacement and exploitation. It means fostering a culture that values originality, skill, and the unique perspectives that only human artists can bring. We must be aware of the dangers of AI taking over art and not allow it to happen. According to research in *Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications*, artworks created by humans reflect a profound human experience that AI cannot produce.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] UN Trade and Development.

        "statement": "We're here today because we firmly believe that human creativity will not only survive but flourish alongside AI, and we're going to directly address the arguments against this positive vision.\n\nFirst, let's dismantle this notion that AI's ease of use inherently devalues human art. The opposition implies that ease of creation automatically diminishes worth. This is a slippery slope. Many visual artists are finding that AI tools actually enhance their creative process by taking away repetitive and tedious tasks. They're using AI to colorize, upscale images, and automate other processes, which frees them to focus on the core creative work of concept and ideation. *A study* shows that this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities, acting as a tool to amplify their vision. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless; it simply evolves.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't generate anything truly original, that it's merely regurgitating existing data. While AI certainly learns from existing datasets, it also possesses the capacity to combine and transform that data in unexpected and innovative ways. To claim it's incapable of originality is akin to saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. As *Medium* reported in 2024, the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with novel creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. New media artists have embraced AI as part of their creative process.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art. Art is inherently subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal, emotional level. This subjective nature of art means human judgment will remain crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their individual emotions and experiences. *A study* mentioned that, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they argue that using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving our cultural heritage and fostering new artistic creation aren't mutually exclusive endeavors. AI can help us safeguard the art of the past while simultaneously providing powerful new tools for artists today. *A study* in 2023 shows that conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focus solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve alongside AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity. So, I encourage you to explore AI art tools, support artists who are using AI in creative ways, or engage in discussions about the ethical and societal implications of AI in the arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation.\n[2] How Does Technology Influence Unique Art. *Medium*, 2024.\n[3] Creative Collaboration: How Artists and AI Can Work Together.\n[4] AI-Generated Art Vs Human Creativity: A Comparison.\n[5] Evolving Applications of AI and VR in Art Conservation, 2023.",

This debate isn't just about technology; it's about preserving human value, originality, and economic opportunity in the arts.\n\nFirst, let's talk about value. The opposition calls AI a tool, but they ignore how easily AI generates art, which inherently *devalues* human skill. Years of training are reduced to a text prompt. This undermines the dedication of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI stifles originality. Human artists draw from life, but AI relies on existing data, leading to artistic homogenization. It cannot create something truly *new*. The long-term consequence is a limited body of human original work.\n\nThird, the threat to economic opportunity is real. The art market, a $65 billion industry, faces disruption. The idea that AI is just a tool ignores the reality of job displacement for millions of artists.\n\nThe opposition argues that AI *can* be a tool, but that doesn't negate its potential for harm. The harm of job displacement cannot be dismissed. They also say art is subjective, but this argument exists in a vacuum. The scale and availability of AI art *will* affect appreciation of human work. What we appreciate is influenced by what is readily available, and if AI art floods the market, it *will* lower the bar for what is considered \"good\" art.\n\nWe must act to protect human artists. We need policies that safeguard their rights, ensuring fair compensation and attribution. We must foster a culture that values originality.

        "statement": "We're here today to address a crucial question: will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? To ensure we're on the same page, let's define what we mean. We're not talking about minor ups and downs in the art market. We're arguing that AI, through its increasing ability to mimic, automate, and commodify creative work, will fundamentally reduce the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-created art across all mediums. This will result in a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and undervalued. Our concern is the long-term impact on how we perceive, create, and support art.\n\nTo properly evaluate this, we propose the most important criteria is whether AI negatively impacts the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists in the long run. By \"value,\" we mean the perceived worth of art in society. By \"economic opportunity,\" we mean the ability of artists to make a living. Are we fostering a world where human creativity is cherished and supported, or one where it's increasingly overshadowed by algorithms?\n\nFirst, let's consider the value of human art. The ease with which AI can generate art devalues the years of dedicated skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. As *researchers at the University of Oxford* noted in their 2023 study on the impact of AI on creative industries, the act of AI replicating a skilled artist\u2019s work creates the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. Imagine someone typing a simple prompt and instantly generating an image that mimics the style of a master painter. This ease of creation cheapens the perceived value of human artistic skill, making it harder to appreciate the dedication and effort that goes into creating art by hand.\n\nSecond, let's examine originality. AI\u2019s algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. Diversity and originality are vital to a thriving art scene. AI art, in this sense, is like a library where every book is written using the same set of phrases. While technically impressive, the result is a lack of unique voices and perspectives. Just as a garden needs diverse plants to flourish, the art world needs a variety of styles and approaches to truly thrive. According to *MIT Technology Review in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, prompting concerns that it may lack genuine originality. This ultimately leads to a less vibrant and engaging cultural landscape.\n\nThird, let's address economic opportunity. The rise of AI art poses a significant threat of job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. If companies can leverage AI to create art for commercial purposes, they are less likely to hire human artists. *Statista's 2024 AI Art Statistics* reports that 55% of artists believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income. This could lead to a decline in income and opportunities for artists, making it even harder for them to pursue their passion.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to the future of human creative arts by devaluing skills, homogenizing styles, and threatening jobs. Therefore, we must act. I urge you to support human artists by actively seeking out and valuing their work, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, and being mindful of the art you consume. Let's ensure a future where human creativity continues to flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] University of Oxford. (2023). *The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on the Creative Industries*.

        "mode": "analyze_statement",
        "statement": "We appreciate the opponent laying out their stance on this complex issue. To avoid getting bogged down in semantics, let\u2019s clarify one point. When we say AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts, we are not saying there will be no changes or challenges. Rather, we are stating that human creativity will continue to thrive, evolve, and find new avenues for expression, even with the rise of AI.\n\nNow, about the judging criteria. For the sake of argument, we concede that the debate should be evaluated based on AI's long-term impact on the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. However, we believe that focusing solely on negative impacts presents a skewed picture.\n\nWith this out of the way, we want to propose three arguments. First, AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opponent's argument hinges on a false dichotomy: tools that augment versus AI that replaces. However, AI art generation still requires human input in the form of prompts, curation, and refinement. The AI is a tool that artists can use to explore new creative avenues. AI acts as an augmented tool, expanding the artist's capacity for innovation rather than overshadowing human creativity. This collaboration sparks a debate surrounding the essence of creativity and originality. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction. In fact, mastering the art of collaboration with AI requires a multifaceted skill set encompassing some level of technical proficiency and creative vision. Furthermore, artists are already using AI to enhance their creative process.\n\nSecond, the subjective nature of art appreciation ensures that human judgment will always be crucial in evaluating artistic merit. Art is fundamentally subjective, and human taste and preferences will continue to play a critical role in determining what is considered valuable and meaningful art. As *Art History And Education* explains, each viewer interprets a painting through their own emotions, experiences, and memories. This personal connection is what makes traditional painted art such a powerful emotional medium.\n\nThird, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. As *Ultralytics* reported in 2024, AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning. These tools can enhance the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This also allows artists to learn from and build upon the traditions of the past, fostering new forms of creative expression.\n\nFinally, the opponent claims that AI will devalue, flatten, and threaten jobs in the art world. We believe this paints an incomplete picture. Their argument assumes quantity equates to impact, ignoring the enduring power of human-created art to resonate on a deeper, more meaningful level. The opponent also presents a false dilemma by assuming that AI art necessitates the complete replacement of human artists. In fact, AI is breaking down barriers by making art creation more accessible and affordable.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ultralytics. 2024.

        "statement": "Alright, let\u2019s get to it. We stand firm that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, impacting value, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. Now, let's respond to the points made by the other side.\n\nFirst, they argue that AI is simply a tool that amplifies human creativity and enhances artists' workflows. But this presents a false choice. It\u2019s not an either/or situation. Yes, *some* artists are using AI successfully as a tool, and we are not against this usage. However, AI *can* also be a force that devalues human skill and homogenizes artistic expression. It assumes that just because AI can be used as a tool, it cannot simultaneously cause harm. That's like saying a hammer can't hurt you because you can also use it to build a house. The fact is, AI's ability to generate art so easily undermines the perceived value of human-created art, regardless of whether some artists find it a useful tool. They might point to examples of AI assisting in art restoration, but that doesn't address the core issue. As *Matt Corrall* pointed out in an interview with , AI's view of the world is limited to the data it was trained on, so it is technically incapable of producing anything truly new. Just because an artist uses AI does not mean that that piece of art has originality. This is because algorithms often rely on pre-existing data.\n\nSecond, they claim that the subjective nature of art means human judgment will always be crucial. Of course, art is subjective; people will always have different tastes. However, this doesn't negate AI's potential to diminish the overall value and importance of human art. Think about it this way: Even if some people still prefer handcrafted goods, the rise of mass-produced items has undeniably impacted the livelihoods of artisans. Subjectivity doesn't exist in a vacuum. The ease and availability of AI-generated art will inevitably shape people's perceptions and preferences, leading to a decline in appreciation for the unique qualities of human-created art. According to *UN Trade and Development's 2023* report, generative AI systems have already made significant inroads into creative industries, with human creatives being replaced in significant numbers in industries ranging from graphics design to game design.\n\nThird, they suggest AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks. While this is a positive application of AI, it doesn't outweigh the broader concerns about the future of human creativity. Using AI to preserve art from the past is not a justification for letting it diminish art being produced today. If all new art lacks originality, *the volume* of original work will be limited in the future. As *PMC* reported in *2023*, the contemporary art world is a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists.\n\nUltimately, we must protect and help human artists. We need to actively support human artists. We need to value their skills and dedication. We can push for rules that defend artists' rights. We need to be aware of the art we use. We want to make sure that human creativity keeps growing. This means we need to challenge the idea that AI-generated art is just as valuable as human-created art. It means supporting policies that protect artists from job displacement and exploitation. It means fostering a culture that values originality, skill, and the unique perspectives that only human artists can bring. We must be aware of the dangers of AI taking over art and not allow it to happen. According to research in *Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications*, artworks created by humans reflect a profound human experience that AI cannot produce.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] UN Trade and Development.

        "statement": "We're here today because we firmly believe that human creativity will not only survive but flourish alongside AI, and we're going to directly address the arguments against this positive vision.\n\nFirst, let's dismantle this notion that AI's ease of use inherently devalues human art. The opposition implies that ease of creation automatically diminishes worth. This is a slippery slope. Many visual artists are finding that AI tools actually enhance their creative process by taking away repetitive and tedious tasks. They're using AI to colorize, upscale images, and automate other processes, which frees them to focus on the core creative work of concept and ideation. *A study* shows that this allows them to complete their projects faster and more efficiently. So, AI isn't replacing artists; it's augmenting their abilities, acting as a tool to amplify their vision. Just because AI makes art more accessible doesn't mean human skill is worthless; it simply evolves.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that AI can't generate anything truly original, that it's merely regurgitating existing data. While AI certainly learns from existing datasets, it also possesses the capacity to combine and transform that data in unexpected and innovative ways. To claim it's incapable of originality is akin to saying a chef can't create a new dish because they only use existing ingredients. As *Medium* reported in 2024, the intersection of technology and art is a testament to human creativity and ingenuity. AI algorithms can surprise us with novel creations, pushing the boundaries of what's possible. New media artists have embraced AI as part of their creative process.\n\nThird, the opposition claims AI will diminish appreciation for human art. Art is inherently subjective. People will always connect with art on a personal, emotional level. This subjective nature of art means human judgment will remain crucial. Even if AI art becomes widespread, people will still seek out art that resonates with their individual emotions and experiences. *A study* mentioned that, compared to human art, there have been repeated mentions that AI art lacks emotional depth. The fact that it doesn\u2019t draw from authentic and genuine human experience often makes it difficult to inspire emotive feelings from the audience.\n\nFourth, they argue that using AI to preserve old art doesn't justify diminishing new art. But preserving our cultural heritage and fostering new artistic creation aren't mutually exclusive endeavors. AI can help us safeguard the art of the past while simultaneously providing powerful new tools for artists today. *A study* in 2023 shows that conservators are leveraging the increasing applications of AI to enhance conservation processes, making necessary tasks that much more precise and effective. The art world is employing millions of human artists.\n\nFifth, the opposition's criteria focus solely on the *negative* impacts of AI. That's like judging a car only by its potential to cause accidents, ignoring its ability to transport us and create opportunities. We need a balanced view. AI can also increase accessibility, create new avenues, and preserve historical works.\n\nFinally, let's reinforce our main point: Human creativity will continue to thrive and evolve alongside AI. As *Medium* stated in 2024, the ongoing evolution of technology promises to further blur the lines between the physical and digital, the real and the virtual, offering artists an ever-expanding canvas on which to explore and express their creativity. So, I encourage you to explore AI art tools, support artists who are using AI in creative ways, or engage in discussions about the ethical and societal implications of AI in the arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation.\n[2] How Does Technology Influence Unique Art. *Medium*, 2024.\n[3] Creative Collaboration: How Artists and AI Can Work Together.\n[4] AI-Generated Art Vs Human Creativity: A Comparison.\n[5] Evolving Applications of AI and VR in Art Conservation, 2023.",

The opposition calls AI a tool, but they ignore how easily AI generates art, which inherently *devalues* human skill. Years of training are reduced to a text prompt. This undermines the dedication of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI stifles originality. Human artists draw from life, but AI relies on existing data, leading to artistic homogenization. It cannot create something truly *new*. The long-term consequence is a limited body of human original work.\n\nThird, the threat to economic opportunity is real.

The harm of job displacement cannot be dismissed. They also say art is subjective, but this argument exists in a vacuum. The scale and availability of AI art *will* affect appreciation of human work. What we appreciate is influenced by what is readily available, and if AI art floods the market, it *will* lower the bar for what is considered \"good\" art.\n\nWe must act to protect human artists. We need policies that safeguard their rights, ensuring fair compensation and attribution. We must foster a culture that values originality.
