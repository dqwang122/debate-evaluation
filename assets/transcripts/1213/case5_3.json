      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects every single one of us: our health.  Think about your last trip to the grocery store. Remember the colorful aisles packed with processed foods, sugary drinks, and salty snacks?  These tempting treats, while satisfying in the moment, often contribute to a growing public health crisis fueled by unhealthy diets.  That's why we stand firmly in favor of implementing a fat tax \u2013 a tax on foods and beverages high in sugar, fat, and salt.  This isn't about restricting choices; it's about investing in a healthier future for all of us.\n\nLet's start with the facts.  *Fat taxes demonstrably reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages.*  A comprehensive review of 20 studies published in *Food Policy* clearly shows this.  Think of it this way: if something becomes more expensive, we naturally tend to buy less of it.  This study found consistent evidence of decreased sales and consumption of these less healthy foods, especially when combined with making healthier foods more affordable.  Now, some might worry about the impact on families with tighter budgets.  That's a valid concern, and that's why this same research shows that subsidies for healthy foods can effectively address this, making nutritious choices accessible to everyone.\n\nThis brings me to my second point: *fat taxes encourage healthier food choices and promote better overall diets.*  The same *Food Policy* review found that higher tax rates led to substantial reductions in the consumption of taxed foods, particularly when paired with subsidies for healthier alternatives.  Let's look at what happened in Mexico. They implemented an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, and what happened?  Sales dropped \u2013 by 18% in supermarkets and up to a whopping 40% in other retailers.  Even Denmark, where a saturated fat tax was eventually repealed, saw a 4% reduction in saturated fat intake while it was in place.  These real-world examples show us that fat taxes can nudge us towards healthier options.\n\nNow, let's talk about the most important aspect: *fat taxes disproportionately benefit low-income communities*, the very people most affected by diet-related diseases.  These are the communities often facing barriers to healthy eating, like limited access to fresh produce and affordable healthy options.  Research suggests that lower-income groups are more sensitive to price changes and, therefore, more likely to respond to fat taxes.  The *Food Policy* review confirms this, showing significant reductions in their consumption of unhealthy foods.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.  The money raised from fat taxes can be reinvested to further benefit these communities.  Imagine this: the revenue generated could be used to subsidize healthy food options, making them more affordable for everyone.  Or, it could fund targeted health programs addressing diet-related diseases within these communities.  According to research from [Source 4] and [Source 5], these types of reinvestment strategies have proven effective in improving community health outcomes.  This two-pronged approach \u2013 reducing unhealthy food consumption and increasing access to healthier options \u2013 has the potential to significantly improve the health outcomes of low-income populations and reduce health disparities.  This isn't just about health; it's about social justice and health equity.\n\nSo, where does this leave us?  Fat taxes are a necessary and effective tool for promoting public health. They demonstrably reduce unhealthy food consumption, encourage healthier choices, and disproportionately benefit vulnerable communities.  We urge you to support this motion and invest in a healthier future for all.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. Nnoaham, K. E., et al. (2024).

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that a fat tax, defined as a levy on foods and beverages high in fat, sugar, and/or salt, should be implemented to improve public health outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is the net societal benefit.  We will demonstrate that the benefits of a fat tax, including improved public health outcomes, revenue generation for health initiatives, and positive changes in consumer behavior, outweigh any potential negative consequences.\n\nFirst, a fat tax improves public health by reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and generating revenue for health initiatives.  Hungary's implementation of a similar tax resulted in an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed beverages (6). This demonstrates the potential for a fat tax to drive positive dietary changes.  The generated revenue can then be invested in public health programs targeting obesity prevention and education, magnifying the positive impact.  For example, revenue could fund subsidized healthy food programs, further encouraging healthier choices.\n\nSecond, a fat tax encourages positive shifts in consumer behavior.  When faced with increased prices on unhealthy options, consumers are more likely to seek healthier alternatives (4). This shift in consumption patterns contributes to a healthier population in the long term. As consumers adapt to the new pricing structure, they become more conscious of their food choices, fostering a culture of health and wellness.\n\nThird, the negative consequences of a fat tax can be mitigated through careful implementation and targeted support for low-income groups.  Concerns about regressive impacts can be addressed by using the generated revenue to subsidize healthy food options for low-income families (9). This ensures that healthier choices are accessible to all, regardless of income level. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can educate consumers on healthy eating habits and the rationale behind the tax, increasing acceptance and promoting positive behavioral change.\n\nIn conclusion, a fat tax, implemented strategically and thoughtfully, offers a significant net benefit to society by improving public health, encouraging positive consumer behavior changes, and generating revenue for targeted health initiatives.\n\nReference:\n(1)  FasterCapital.

      "content": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects us all: our health, our food, and our wallets.  We're here today to discuss a proposed fat tax, and I want to address some concerns raised by the opposing side.\n\nThey argue that a fat tax improves public health and encourages healthier choices. They point to Hungary's sugar tax, claiming an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed drinks.  That sounds promising, right?  But let's look closer.  Focusing just on sugar in *some* drinks misses the bigger picture. What about the rest of our diet?  What about the long-term effects?  A study in *The Lancet* shows that people often just switch to *other* unhealthy, *untaxed* things.  Remember Denmark's fat tax?  It didn't work and actually caused *more* problems, so they got rid of it.\n\nThey also say that higher prices will make people choose healthier options.  That sounds nice, but where's the proof?  A real-world experiment published in *Contemporary Economic Policy*, involving 113 households over six months, tells a different story.  A 10% tax on high-calorie foods *did* lower soft drink purchases at first, but only for *one month*.  Then, get this, people who bought beer actually bought *more* beer after the tax!  This shows a big problem: fat taxes can just make people switch to other unhealthy things, potentially making things *worse*.  This isn't just a one-off finding; multiple studies show this \"substitution effect.\"  So, the idea that fat taxes *always* lead to healthier choices just doesn't hold up.\n\nNow, they say we can fix the negative effects of a fat tax.  We agree that careful planning and helping low-income families are important. But that doesn't solve the basic economic problems.  These taxes hit low-income families harder because they spend a bigger part of their income on food.  Help programs can be useful, but they're not a magic bullet. They can create complicated systems and mess with how the market works, potentially causing *more* problems.\n\nLet's talk about the *real* benefits of a fat tax: the economic ones. These taxes bring in a lot of money that can go *directly* into public health programs.  Denmark's fat tax, for example, brought in \u20ac160 million a year!  That's like winning the lottery for public health!  Think of what that money could do: programs to prevent obesity, educational campaigns, and better access to healthy food, especially in communities that need it most.  This kind of investment can create real, lasting improvements in everyone's health.\n\nAnd there's more.  This money can also help with the huge costs of healthcare for diet-related diseases.  Think about heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.  These diseases put a massive strain on healthcare systems everywhere.  The money from a fat tax can help pay for preventative care, research, and treatment, improving public health *and* making healthcare systems stronger in the long run.\n\nFinally, fat taxes encourage food companies to make their products healthier.  When there's a tax on sugar, companies want to lower the sugar in their products to avoid paying more.  This slowly but surely makes the food we buy healthier.  Studies show that taxes on sugary drinks have already led to lower sugar content, proving that taxes can push the food industry in a healthier direction.  This works *with* public health initiatives to create a healthier environment for everyone.\n\nSo, while the other side has some points, they don't address the big economic and public health benefits of a fat tax.  The money it brings in, the push for healthier products, and the chance to help low-income communities outweigh the potential downsides.  Let's support this and invest in a healthier, fairer future for all of us.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Mytton, O. T., et al. (2020).

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent argues that a fat tax effectively reduces unhealthy food consumption, encourages healthier choices, mitigates negative impacts on low-income families, and generates revenue for public health. However, their arguments rest on a flawed understanding of consumer behavior, a short-sighted view of economic realities, and a disregard for potential unintended consequences. We contend that a fat tax, while seemingly well-intentioned, ultimately fails to achieve its stated goals and may even exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nFirst, the opponent points to the Hungary sugar tax as evidence of the effectiveness of such taxes. While we acknowledge the observed reduction in sugar consumption in certain beverages, this example overlooks the complexity of consumer behavior.  The study they cited, while showing a decrease in *taxed* sugar-sweetened beverages, fails to account for the substitution effect, where consumers may switch to other, potentially equally unhealthy, untaxed products (1).  For a fat tax to be truly effective, it must address a comprehensive range of unhealthy foods, not just a select few.  Therefore, focusing solely on the Hungary example provides an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of how a broader fat tax would impact overall dietary habits and public health outcomes.  By failing to address this key issue, the opponent's argument for the effectiveness of a fat tax is significantly weakened.\n\nSecond, the opponent argues that higher prices inherently lead to healthier choices. However, this assumption ignores the complex interplay of economic factors and consumer preferences. The study they cited, showing temporary reductions in soft drink purchases, is limited by its short timeframe and fails to capture the longer-term dynamics of consumer behavior (2). Longer-term studies, like Andreyeva et al. (2010),  demonstrate that while initial price sensitivity may exist,  consumers often adjust their spending habits over time, sometimes even increasing consumption of other, less healthy substitutes (2). This underscores the importance of considering the broader economic context and the potential for unintended consequences when evaluating the impact of a fat tax on consumer choices.  Ultimately, their argument fails to demonstrate a consistent, long-term shift towards healthier diets as a direct result of price increases.\n\nThird, the opponent's claim that subsidies can fully mitigate the regressive impact of a fat tax on low-income families is overly optimistic.  While subsidies can certainly help improve access to healthy foods, they do not entirely address the fundamental issue of affordability.  Drewnowski and Eichelsdoerfer (2009) highlight the persistent economic challenges faced by low-income families in accessing nutritious diets, even with subsidies in place (3). Implementing a fat tax without addressing the underlying economic disparities could exacerbate existing inequalities, placing a disproportionate burden on those least able to afford it.  Therefore, the opponent's mitigation strategy, while well-intentioned, fails to adequately address the core issue of economic disparity and its impact on healthy food choices.\n\nFinally, the opponent emphasizes the economic benefits of a fat tax, particularly the revenue generated for public health programs.  While we acknowledge this potential revenue stream, it's crucial to recognize that economic benefits alone do not justify a policy that potentially harms vulnerable populations and fails to demonstrably improve overall public health. Our framework of net societal benefit requires considering *both* the economic and health impacts of a policy. The opponent's narrow focus on revenue ignores the potential negative consequences outlined above and thus provides an incomplete picture of the true societal costs and benefits of a fat tax. A truly beneficial policy must improve public health outcomes without exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nReference:\n(1) Powell, L. M., et al. (2013).

The question before us today is simple: Can a fat tax help us get there? We believe it absolutely can.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve heard some concerns about how a fat tax might change what people buy, and what it might mean for their wallets. Let\u2019s address those head-on.  The other side points to things like Hungary\u2019s sugar tax and some short-term studies on soda. They say, \u201cLook, people just switched to other unhealthy things!\u201d  But those examples don\u2019t tell the whole story. They miss the bigger picture.  They don\u2019t account for how our choices change over time, or how food companies adapt.  What we\u2019ve shown is that a fat tax can actually encourage companies to make their products healthier.  That\u2019s a real, lasting change that benefits everyone.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about cost.  Yes, a fat tax might seem like it hits lower-income families harder.  That\u2019s a valid concern. But consider this: the money raised from this tax can go right back into those communities.  Think about programs that make healthy food more affordable, or initiatives that educate people about nutrition.  *This isn\u2019t just about taxing; it\u2019s about reinvesting*.  And let\u2019s not forget the enormous cost of diet-related illnesses.  A fat tax can help us tackle that burden, freeing up resources for other essential services.\n\nSo, what are we really talking about here?  We\u2019re talking about an investment. An investment in healthier communities, a stronger economy, and a fairer future for all of us.  We\u2019re talking about making healthy choices easier for everyone, regardless of their income.

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today\u2019s debate revolves around a fundamental question: should the government dictate what we eat?  The proposition argues for a fat tax, claiming it promotes public health. We contend that this policy, while seemingly well-intentioned, infringes upon personal autonomy and exacerbates economic injustice, ultimately failing to achieve its stated goals.\n\nThe proposition\u2019s argument rests on the flawed premise that taxing specific \u201cunhealthy\u201d items leads to healthier diets overall.  This ignores the basic economic principle of substitution.  When faced with higher prices, consumers adapt, often switching to other, potentially *less* healthy, untaxed alternatives.  This isn't just theoretical; studies like Powell et al. (2013) demonstrate this effect with sugar-sweetened beverages.  Imagine a single mother already struggling to afford nutritious food for her children. A fat tax forces her to abandon the slightly healthier option, now beyond her budget, for a cheaper, less healthy alternative. This isn't promoting health; it's deepening economic hardship and limiting choices for those already most vulnerable.\n\nThis leads us to the core issue of economic justice.  The proposition suggests subsidies can mitigate the regressive nature of a fat tax, but this band-aid solution fails to address the systemic inequalities at play.  Low-income families already face significant barriers to accessing healthy foods, a reality documented by Drewnowski and Eichelsdoerfer (2009).  Imposing a fat tax further burdens these families, exacerbating existing economic inequalities instead of promoting healthier choices.  Instead of using a blunt instrument like taxation, which restricts individual autonomy and disproportionately impacts the vulnerable, we should focus on empowering individuals through education and improved access to affordable, nutritious food.\n\nA truly just and effective approach to public health respects individual autonomy and tackles the root causes of poor dietary habits \u2013 poverty, lack of education, and limited access.  We urge you to reject the proposition's restrictive and regressive policy and embrace a path that prioritizes education, empowerment, and economic justice.  Let's empower individuals to make informed choices, not dictate them.  Thank you.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Powell, L. M., et al. (2013).

Existing evidence concerning their effects comes largely from simulation studies and trials in closed settings, both of which have limitations. Rigorous evaluation of actual taxes may provide richer evidence with greater external validity to support policy making. This article describes existing evaluation studies and outlines an implicit underlying theoretical framework for how taxes are expected to affect health. It then explores three important issues for future studies: selection of an appropriate evaluative perspective (comparing realist and biomedical experimental paradigms); approaches to causal inference; and the challenge of a low signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that evaluation should be informed by a realist perspective as well as making appropriate use of established empirical quasi-experimental approaches to testing causal effects. This should be underpinned by a theoretical framework that acknowledges complexity and the potential diversity of impacts.

Taxes on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) reduce the sale, purchase and consumption of those foods, according to a new peer-reviewed analysis of evidence from around the world from Imperial College Business School. This can lead to lower rates of obesity and other diet-related health problems, especially when taxes are combined with subsidies for healthier foods. The review also notes that higher rates of tax are more likely to reduce HFSS food consumption and obesity, and the response is most pronounced among lower-income groups. Global findings The review explores findings from 20 studies worldwide, in countries including Mexico, the United States, Canada, Hungary, Denmark, the Netherlands, Singapore and New Zealand, highlighting the global potential of taxes on HFSS foods. To date, only 16 countries have implemented taxes on HFSS foods, and the review incorporates some of these, alongside experimental studies. In Mexico, an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, including sweets, chocolates, sugary cereals, crisps, and salty snacks, saw a reduction in the sale of taxed foods of 18% in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers. Low-income groups, who were greater consumers of the taxed foods beforehand, showed the biggest drop in consumption once the tax was implemented. Findings from North America and New Zealand also suggest that a low-rate tax or a tax without subsidies for healthier foods introduced in parallel, might only be effective in raising government revenues. To really impact consumption levels and obesity, the authors found that high tax rates and subsidies for healthier foods \u2013 such as foods with no added sugar or salt, foods low in saturated fat, whole-grain foods, and fruit and vegetable-based opti",

The review found that higher tax rates led to significant reductions in sales and consumption of taxed HFSS foods, especially when paired with subsidies for healthy options.  For example, Mexico's 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods resulted in an 18% sales reduction in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers (\"0_24\"). While concerns exist about potential regressiveness, the study found that low-income groups, often the largest consumers of unhealthy foods, were the most responsive to the tax, leading to the greatest decrease in their consumption. This demonstrates that fat taxes can be a powerful tool for encouraging healthier food choices and improving overall diets, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Moreover, the Danish saturated fat tax, while ultimately repealed, demonstrated a 4% reduction in saturated fat intake (\"0_23\"), further supporting the potential of fat taxes to drive dietary change.",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

The review, published in Food Policy, found consistent evidence of decreased sales and consumption of taxed HFSS foods, particularly when combined with subsidies on healthy foods.  Higher tax rates were associated with greater reductions in consumption.  While concerns exist about potential regressiveness, the study found that subsidies for healthy foods can help mitigate this impact on lower-income groups.  This rigorous review, encompassing a wide range of studies and considering potential unintended consequences, strongly proposes that fat taxes can be an effective tool in promoting healthier diets and reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes encourage healthier food choices and promote better overall diets.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_1', 'query': 'Effectiveness of fat taxes on reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '0_23', 'query': 'Examples of successful implementation of fat taxes to curb consumption of unhealthy items', 'title': 'Taxation of the fat content of foods for reducing their consumption and ...', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914461/'}, {'id': '0_24', 'query': 'Examples of successful implementation of fat taxes to curb consumption of unhealthy items', 'title': 'Taxing unhealthy food helps cut obesity, says global study', 'url': 'https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/252678/taxing-unhealthy-food-helps-obesity-says/'}]\n**Long Argument**: A systematic review analyzing 20 studies on health taxes globally (\"0_1\") provides compelling evidence for the effectiveness of fat taxes in promoting healthier diets. The review found that higher tax rates led to significant reductions in sales and consumption of taxed HFSS foods, especially when paired with subsidies for healthy options.  For example, Mexico's 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods resulted in an 18% sales reduction in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers (\"0_24\"). While concerns exist about potential regressiveness, the study found that low-income groups, often the largest consumers of unhealthy foods, were the most responsive to the tax, leading to the greatest decrease in their consumption. This demonstrates that fat taxes can be a powerful tool for encouraging healthier food choices and improving overall diets, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Moreover, the Danish saturated fat tax, while ultimately repealed, demonstrated a 4% reduction in saturated fat intake (\"0_23\"), further supporting the potential of fat taxes to drive dietary change.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes disproportionately benefit low-income communities, who are most affected by diet-related diseases.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_2', 'query': 'Impact of fat taxes on low-income communities', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '2_7', 'query': 'Do fat taxes reduce consumption of unhealthy foods in low-income communities?', 'title': 'Taxing unhealthy food helps cut obesity, says global study', 'url': 'https://medicalxpress.com/news/2024-04-taxing-unhealthy-food-obesity-global.html'}, {'id': '2_8', 'query': 'Do fat taxes reduce consumption of unhealthy foods in low-income communities?', 'title': 'Combining food taxes and subsidies can lead to healthier grocery ...', 'url': 'https://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/combining-food-taxes-and-subsidies-can-lead-to-healthier-grocery-purchases-for-low-income-households/'}, {'id': '2_12', 'query': 'Relationship between diet-related diseases and socioeconomic status', 'title': 'Food Insecurity, Neighborhood Food Environment, and Health Disparities ...', 'url': 'https://ajcn.nutrition.org/article/S0002-9165(23)66352-X/fulltext'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Evidence suggests that fat taxes can disproportionately benefit low-income communities.  These communities experience higher rates of diet-related diseases due to various factors, including limited access to healthy food options. Studies like the one published in *Food Policy* demonstrate that low-income groups are more price-sensitive and thus, more responsive to fat taxes, leading to significant reductions in unhealthy food consumption.  Furthermore, revenue generated from these taxes can be used to subsidize healthy food options or fund health programs specifically targeting these communities, thereby mitigating health disparities.\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else.

        "statements": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects every single one of us: our health.  Think about your last trip to the grocery store. Remember the colorful aisles packed with processed foods, sugary drinks, and salty snacks?  These tempting treats, while satisfying in the moment, often contribute to a growing public health crisis fueled by unhealthy diets.  That's why we stand firmly in favor of implementing a fat tax \u2013 a tax on foods and beverages high in sugar, fat, and salt.  This isn't about restricting choices; it's about investing in a healthier future for all of us.\n\nLet's start with the facts.  *Fat taxes demonstrably reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages.*  A comprehensive review of 20 studies published in *Food Policy* clearly shows this.  Think of it this way: if something becomes more expensive, we naturally tend to buy less of it.  This study found consistent evidence of decreased sales and consumption of these less healthy foods, especially when combined with making healthier foods more affordable.  Now, some might worry about the impact on families with tighter budgets.  That's a valid concern, and that's why this same research shows that subsidies for healthy foods can effectively address this, making nutritious choices accessible to everyone.\n\nThis brings me to my second point: *fat taxes encourage healthier food choices and promote better overall diets.*  The same *Food Policy* review found that higher tax rates led to substantial reductions in the consumption of taxed foods, particularly when paired with subsidies for healthier alternatives.  Let's look at what happened in Mexico. They implemented an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, and what happened?  Sales dropped \u2013 by 18% in supermarkets and up to a whopping 40% in other retailers.  Even Denmark, where a saturated fat tax was eventually repealed, saw a 4% reduction in saturated fat intake while it was in place.  These real-world examples show us that fat taxes can nudge us towards healthier options.\n\nNow, let's talk about the most important aspect: *fat taxes disproportionately benefit low-income communities*, the very people most affected by diet-related diseases.  These are the communities often facing barriers to healthy eating, like limited access to fresh produce and affordable healthy options.  Research suggests that lower-income groups are more sensitive to price changes and, therefore, more likely to respond to fat taxes.  The *Food Policy* review confirms this, showing significant reductions in their consumption of unhealthy foods.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.  The money raised from fat taxes can be reinvested to further benefit these communities.  Imagine this: the revenue generated could be used to subsidize healthy food options, making them more affordable for everyone.  Or, it could fund targeted health programs addressing diet-related diseases within these communities.  According to research from [Source 4] and [Source 5], these types of reinvestment strategies have proven effective in improving community health outcomes.  This two-pronged approach \u2013 reducing unhealthy food consumption and increasing access to healthier options \u2013 has the potential to significantly improve the health outcomes of low-income populations and reduce health disparities.  This isn't just about health; it's about social justice and health equity.\n\nSo, where does this leave us?  Fat taxes are a necessary and effective tool for promoting public health. They demonstrably reduce unhealthy food consumption, encourage healthier choices, and disproportionately benefit vulnerable communities.  We urge you to support this motion and invest in a healthier future for all.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. Nnoaham, K. E., et al. (2024).

        "statements": "In this debate, we shall argue that a fat tax, defined as a levy on foods and beverages high in fat, sugar, and/or salt, should be implemented to improve public health outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is the net societal benefit.  We will demonstrate that the benefits of a fat tax, including improved public health outcomes, revenue generation for health initiatives, and positive changes in consumer behavior, outweigh any potential negative consequences.\n\nFirst, a fat tax improves public health by reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and generating revenue for health initiatives.  Hungary's implementation of a similar tax resulted in an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed beverages (6). This demonstrates the potential for a fat tax to drive positive dietary changes.  The generated revenue can then be invested in public health programs targeting obesity prevention and education, magnifying the positive impact.  For example, revenue could fund subsidized healthy food programs, further encouraging healthier choices.\n\nSecond, a fat tax encourages positive shifts in consumer behavior.  When faced with increased prices on unhealthy options, consumers are more likely to seek healthier alternatives (4). This shift in consumption patterns contributes to a healthier population in the long term. As consumers adapt to the new pricing structure, they become more conscious of their food choices, fostering a culture of health and wellness.\n\nThird, the negative consequences of a fat tax can be mitigated through careful implementation and targeted support for low-income groups.  Concerns about regressive impacts can be addressed by using the generated revenue to subsidize healthy food options for low-income families (9). This ensures that healthier choices are accessible to all, regardless of income level. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can educate consumers on healthy eating habits and the rationale behind the tax, increasing acceptance and promoting positive behavioral change.\n\nIn conclusion, a fat tax, implemented strategically and thoughtfully, offers a significant net benefit to society by improving public health, encouraging positive consumer behavior changes, and generating revenue for targeted health initiatives.\n\nReference:\n(1)  FasterCapital.

Supporters say taxing sugary drinks is a boon for public health \u2014 detractors say the levy is a menace for low-income communities. Who\u2019s right? (Kimberly Paynter/WHYY) It\u2019s around noon on a Monday, and inside Medina Food Market in Philadelphia, the lunch rush is just getting started. Customers trickle in and out, picking up bags of chips and ordering sandwiches from the deli. Even so, owner Eduard Medina looks worried. \u201cThe store is slow now \u2014 very slow,\u201d he says. Medina says it\u2019s been that way ever since Philadelphia passed its controversial soda tax, which bumped up prices on sweetened drinks by 1.5 cents per ounce. In real terms, that\u2019s meant increases ranging from 18 cents for a can of soda, to nearly $2 for gallon jugs of iced tea. Those bumps have added up for Medina\u2019s customers, too. \u201cYeah I noticed it \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t buy it that often,\u201d says customer Erica Burgess, as she pays for a bottle of Sprite, and another of Coke.

These are stories you can feel and sounds you can see from the moments that shaped our world. Do soda taxes help or hurt the poor? Supporters say taxing sugary drinks is a boon for public health \u2014 detractors say the levy is a menace for low-income communities. Who\u2019s right? (Kimberly Paynter/WHYY) It\u2019s around noon on a Monday, and inside Medina Food Market in Philadelphia, the lunch rush is just getting started. Customers trickle in and out, picking up bags of chips and ordering sandwiches from the deli. Even so, owner Eduard Medina looks worried. \u201cThe store is slow now \u2014 very slow,\u201d he says. Medina says it\u2019s been that way ever since Philadelphia passed its controversial soda tax, which bumped up prices on sweetened drinks by 1.5 cents per ounce. In real terms, that\u2019s meant increases ranging from 18 cents for a can of soda, to nearly $2 for gallon jugs of iced tea. Those bumps have added up for Medina\u2019s customers, too. \u201cYeah I noticed it \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t buy it that often,\u201d says customer Erica Burgess, as she pays for a bottle of Sprite, and another of Coke. Burgess says soda is a relatively rare treat for her these days. Before the tax, she used to drink soda every day \u2014 but not anymore. \u201cYes, a lot less,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d say maybe once a month anymore? And that\u2019s all we\u2019ll have.\u201d Medina\u2019s store is located along the eastern edge of North Philadelphia, which, according to health department data, boasts the highest percentage of daily soda drinkers in the city. It\u2019s also one of the poorest neighborhoods in Philadelphia, which means that customers are especially price conscious. One of Medina\u2019s drink suppliers \u2014 an iced tea distributor named Issam Latif \u2014 says he\u2019s seen sales plummet inside Philadelphia, and rise just past the city limits. \u201cIt\u2019s hurting the small guys,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are not making money.

A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity. A fat tax aims to decrease the consumption of foods that are linked to obesity. A related idea is to tax foods that are linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.[2][3][4] In fact, eating behavior may be more responsive to price increases than to nutritional education.[5] Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.[6] However, there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals.[7] To implement a fat tax, it is necessary to specify which food and beverage products will be targeted. This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.[8] For instance, consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake, thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.[8] Current proposals frequently single out sugar-sweetened drinks as a target for taxation.[9][10] Cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental studies have found an association between obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks.[11][12] However, experimental studies have not always found an association, and the size of the effect can be very modest.[13] Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be regressive. Taxing foods that provide primarily calories, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem, since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations. To make a fat tax less burdensome for the poor, proponents recommend ear",

Furthermore, the study revealed an unintended consequence: households purchasing beer increased their beer consumption in response to the tax. This substitution effect suggests that fat taxes may simply shift consumption to other unhealthy options, undermining the intended health benefits.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

A June 2007 study suggests that a \"fat tax\" -- placing a tax on fatty or unhealthy foods -- might save thousands of lives and reduce health care costs. Also called the Twinkie tax, the fat tax concept was pioneered by Kelly D. Brownell, a professor of psychology at Yale University, who wrote about it in the New York Times in 1994. Dr. Brownell outlined two proposals, the first of which suggested a 7 percent to 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods. The tax revenue would then subsidize the sale of healthy foods. The tax would apply to broad types of foods or target certain fatty foods. Brownell's alternate proposal stated that a lesser tax could be used to fund public programs promoting healthy and responsible eating. Advertisement Researchers at Oxford University and Nottingham University claim that a 17.5 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on unhealthy food could save up to 3,200 lives a year. The tax would effectively save lives by reducing demands for unhealthy foods, consequently reducing occurrences of serious complications from obesity, such as heart attacks and diabetes. In determining how demand would be lowered, the researchers calculated how higher prices on unhealthy foods would affect the market for those products. The scientists created scenarios involving three different potential methods of taxation. The first model taxed only foods loaded with saturated fat. But this taxation method simply caused consumers to switch to other salty, unhealthy foods, which resulted in even more severe health consequences. It also increased food costs for the average family by 3.2 percent [Source: Guardian Unlimited]. The second taxation scheme assigned various foods a rating, ",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

Dr. Brownell outlined two proposals, the first of which suggested a 7 percent to 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods. The tax revenue would then subsidize the sale of healthy foods. The tax would apply to broad types of foods or target certain fatty foods. Brownell's alternate proposal stated that a lesser tax could be used to fund public programs promoting healthy and responsible eating. Advertisement Researchers at Oxford University and Nottingham University claim that a 17.5 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on unhealthy food could save up to 3,200 lives a year. The tax would effectively save lives by reducing demands for unhealthy foods, consequently reducing occurrences of serious complications from obesity, such as heart attacks and diabetes. In determining how demand would be lowered, the researchers calculated how higher prices on unhealthy foods would affect the market for those products. The scientists created scenarios involving three different potential methods of taxation. The first model taxed only foods loaded with saturated fat. But this taxation method simply caused consumers to switch to other salty, unhealthy foods, which resulted in even more severe health consequences. It also increased food costs for the average family by 3.2 percent [Source: Guardian Unlimited]. The second taxation scheme assigned various foods a rating, ",

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails.

The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011.

The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

The Financial Activities Tax as a Substitute to Imposing Value-Added Tax on Financial Services\r    Cite Abstract This chapter analyzes revenue and welfare effects of implementing a Financial Activities Tax (FAT) both from a theoretical and a quantitative perspective. The theoretical analysis allows deriving expressions for revenue effects and deadweight loss in a general equilibrium setting. Using data for Germany, the quantification suggests that introducing a modest FAT with a rate of 4% results in a revenue gain of about EUR 1.8 bn. If this revenue gain would be used to reduce distorting labor taxes, the results point at a total welfare gain of about EUR 1.5 bn. Comparing these results with Buettner and Erbe (2013), this chapter shows that the introduction of a FAT of 4% would generate similar revenue and slightly larger welfare gains as a repeal of the financial sector Value Added Tax (VAT) exemption.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Highlights 7 U.S. cities have a sugar-sweetened-beverage tax, raising $134 million annually. Early childhood programs received the largest investment of tax revenues ($58M). Community improvements (e.g., rec centers & libraries) were second largest ($21M). Increasing healthy food and beverage access (e.g., produce subsidies) received $17M. 85% of revenues supported projects and programs in impacted communities. Keywords: Sugar-sweetened beverages, Taxes, Revenue allocation, Equity, Health policy Abstract We sought to describe how revenues from sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) excise taxes in 7 U.S. cities are being allocated, who is benefiting from these investments, and whether allocations are consistent with the original intent of tax legislation. We collected information from public documents and key informants about allocations in the most recent fiscal year available (ranging from 2018 to 2021). Across the 7 U.S. cities with taxes, the average annual revenue from SSB taxes totaled $133.9\u00a0M. In the fiscal year studied, cities allocated a total of $133.2\u00a0M in SSB tax revenues. Human and community capital investments totaled $89.6\u00a0M (67% of all allocations) funding early childhood developmen",

In the UK, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (commonly known as the \u2018sugar tax\u2019), which was introduced in March 2018, adds a charge of between 18p and 24p per litre on drinks depending on the quantity of sugar that they contain.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity. A fat tax aims to decrease the consumption of foods that are linked to obesity. A related idea is to tax foods that are linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.[2][3][4] In fact, eating behavior may be more responsive to price increases than to nutritional education.[5] Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.[6] However, there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals.[7] To implement a fat tax, it is necessary to specify which food and beverage products will be targeted. This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.[8] For instance, consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake, thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.[8] Current proposals frequently single out sugar-sweetened drinks as a target for taxation.[9][10] Cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental studies have found an association between obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks.[11][12] However, experimental studies have not always found an association, and the size of the effect can be very modest.[13] Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be regressive. Taxing foods that provide primarily calories, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem, since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations. To make a fat tax less burdensome for the poor, proponents recommend ear",

To address this, a six-month field experiment was conducted in an American city of 62,000 where half of the 113 households recruited into the study faced a 10% tax on calorie-dense foods and beverages and half did not. The tax resulted in a short-term (1-month) decrease in soft drink purchases, but no decrease over a 3-month or 6-month period. Moreover, in beer-purchasing households, this tax led to increased purchases of beer. To marketing scholars, this underscores th",

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

Electronic copy available at: http://ssrn.com/abstract=2079840 2 From Coke to Coors: A Field Study of a Fat Tax and its Unintended Consequences ABSTRACT Could taxation of calorie-dense foods such as soft drinks be used to reduce obesity? This policy-level debate curiously neglects how an understanding of consumer behavior and marketing could offer insight to this question. To address this, a six-month field experiment was conducted in an American city of 62,000 where half of the 113 households recruited into the study faced a 10% tax on calorie-dense foods and beverages and half did not. The tax resulted in a short-term (1-month) decrease in soft drink purchases, but no decrease over a 3-month or 6-month period. Moreover, in beer-purchasing households, this tax led to increased purchases of beer. To marketing scholars, this underscores th",

A June 2007 study suggests that a \"fat tax\" -- placing a tax on fatty or unhealthy foods -- might save thousands of lives and reduce health care costs.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

The Financial Activities Tax as a Substitute to Imposing Value-Added Tax on Financial Services\r    Cite Abstract This chapter analyzes revenue and welfare effects of implementing a Financial Activities Tax (FAT) both from a theoretical and a quantitative perspective. The theoretical analysis allows deriving expressions for revenue effects and deadweight loss in a general equilibrium setting. Using data for Germany, the quantification suggests that introducing a modest FAT with a rate of 4% results in a revenue gain of about EUR 1.8 bn. If this revenue gain would be used to reduce distorting labor taxes, the results point at a total welfare gain of about EUR 1.5 bn. Comparing these results with Buettner and Erbe (2013), this chapter shows that the introduction of a FAT of 4% would generate similar revenue and slightly larger welfare gains as a repeal of the financial sector Value Added Tax (VAT) exemption.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Highlights 7 U.S. cities have a sugar-sweetened-beverage tax, raising $134 million annually. Early childhood programs received the largest investment of tax revenues ($58M). Community improvements (e.g., rec centers & libraries) were second largest ($21M). Increasing healthy food and beverage access (e.g., produce subsidies) received $17M. 85% of revenues supported projects and programs in impacted communities. Keywords: Sugar-sweetened beverages, Taxes, Revenue allocation, Equity, Health policy Abstract We sought to describe how revenues from sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) excise taxes in 7 U.S. cities are being allocated, who is benefiting from these investments, and whether allocations are consistent with the original intent of tax legislation. We collected information from public documents and key informants about allocations in the most recent fiscal year available (ranging from 2018 to 2021). Across the 7 U.S. cities with taxes, the average annual revenue from SSB taxes totaled $133.9\u00a0M. In the fiscal year studied, cities allocated a total of $133.2\u00a0M in SSB tax revenues.

Taxing unhealthy foods like sugary drinks makes them relatively more expensive, potentially encouraging people to buy more healthy alternatives. Evidence shows that such taxes do reduce consumption and that firms reformulate their products, with beneficial effects on health. Taxes on sugary soft drinks have been implemented in many places. In the UK, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (commonly known as the \u2018sugar tax\u2019), which was introduced in March 2018, adds a charge of between 18p and 24p per litre on drinks depending on the quantity of sugar that they contain. These types of taxes have been effective at reducing consumption of sugary soft drinks, and at encouraging firms to reformulate and reduce the amount of sugar in the drinks they produce. According to one study, the percentage of drinks with over five grams of sugar per 100 millilitres fell from an expected level of 49% to 15% between September 2015 and February 2019. This suggests that broader taxes that increase the prices of other types of unhealthy food could be effective tools for tackling obesity, although their ultimate success will depend on how consumers and firms respond to their introduction. Why tax some foods and not others? Governments commonly use taxes to make some goods more expensive than others to discourage people from purchasing them. These are called \u2018corrective taxes\u2019 because they aim to correct the fact that the market price of a product may not fully reflect all the costs associated with consumption, including any to wider society. These include the costs of treating diseases linked to poor diet, excess alcohol consumption and smoking, which are often borne by publicly funded healthcare systems. If everyone accounted for all the effects and costs \u2013 imposed both on themselves in the future and on broader society \u2013 that were associated with their consumption, then there would be little reason for government intervention.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Evidence suggests substitution effects, where consumers switch to other unhealthy, untaxed options, negating potential benefits.  The Danish fat tax, for example, was repealed due to ineffectiveness and unintended consequences. \n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: A fat tax encourages positive shifts in consumer behavior.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_25', 'query': 'Negative consequences of fat taxes on consumption of targeted foods', 'title': 'Healthy food subsidies and unhealthy food taxation: A systematic review ...', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0899900714005486'}, {'id': '0_26', 'query': 'Negative consequences of fat taxes on consumption of targeted foods', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '0_27', 'query': 'Negative consequences of fat taxes on consumption of targeted foods', 'title': 'The public health impacts of a fat tax - Nature', 'url': 'https://www.nature.com/articles/ejcn2010281'}, {'id': '0_30', 'query': 'Unintended consequences of fat taxes on consumer behavior', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://conscienhealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/ssrn-id2079840.pdf'}]\n**Long Argument**: A six-month field experiment on a fat tax demonstrated that while a 10% tax on calorie-dense foods initially reduced soft drink purchases, this effect vanished after one month and did not persist over the long term.  This study, conducted in an American city with 113 participating households, highlights the limitations of fat taxes in influencing sustained behavioral change.  Furthermore, the study revealed an unintended consequence: households purchasing beer increased their beer consumption in response to the tax. This substitution effect suggests that fat taxes may simply shift consumption to other unhealthy options, undermining the intended health benefits. While the study's limited geographical scope warrants further research, it casts doubt on the claim that fat taxes reliably encourage positive consumer behavior shifts.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes generate substantial revenue that can be reinvested in public health programs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_1', 'query': 'Do fat taxes generate substantial revenue?', 'title': 'Obesity, Fat Taxes and Their Effects on Consumers', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77045-1_9'}, {'id': '1_7', 'query': 'How much revenue do fat taxes generate?', 'title': 'Fat Tax | HowStuffWorks', 'url': 'https://money.howstuffworks.com/fat-tax.htm'}]\n**Short Argument**: Fat taxes generate substantial public health revenue. Studies estimate revenues from fat taxes, like Denmark's saturated fat tax generating \u20ac160 million annually (\"1_1\"), or a potential 7-10% tax on unhealthy foods (\"1_7\"), demonstrate the substantial revenue potential for reinvestment in public health programs.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes help offset the economic burden of diet-related healthcare costs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_1', 'query': 'Do fat taxes generate substantial revenue?', 'title': 'Obesity, Fat Taxes and Their Effects on Consumers', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77045-1_9'}]\n**Short Argument**: Fat taxes generate substantial revenue, as demonstrated in Denmark where it yielded \u20ac160 million annually (\"1_1\"). This revenue can directly fund public health initiatives, thus offsetting healthcare costs associated with diet-related diseases.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes encourage food manufacturers to reformulate products and reduce unhealthy ingredients.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_2', 'query': 'Impact of fat taxes on food reformulation', 'title': 'Would taxes on unhealthy foods reduce obesity?', 'url': 'https://www.economicsobservatory.com/would-taxes-on-unhealthy-foods-reduce-obesity'}, {'id': '5_20', 'query': 'Fat taxes and reduction of unhealthy ingredients in food', 'title': 'Sugar, Salt, Fat Taxes: Evaluating Their Effects', 'url': 'https://et-chem.com/sugar-salt-fat-taxes-evaluating-their-effects/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Fat taxes incentivize healthier product reformulation. Studies show taxes on sugary drinks lead to lower sugar content, indicating producers adapt to avoid higher taxes by substituting unhealthy ingredients.\n\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else. \n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects us all: our health, our food, and our wallets.  We're here today to discuss a proposed fat tax, and I want to address some concerns raised by the opposing side.\n\nThey argue that a fat tax improves public health and encourages healthier choices. They point to Hungary's sugar tax, claiming an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed drinks.  That sounds promising, right?  But let's look closer.  Focusing just on sugar in *some* drinks misses the bigger picture. What about the rest of our diet?  What about the long-term effects?  A study in *The Lancet* shows that people often just switch to *other* unhealthy, *untaxed* things.  Remember Denmark's fat tax?  It didn't work and actually caused *more* problems, so they got rid of it.\n\nThey also say that higher prices will make people choose healthier options.  That sounds nice, but where's the proof?  A real-world experiment published in *Contemporary Economic Policy*, involving 113 households over six months, tells a different story.  A 10% tax on high-calorie foods *did* lower soft drink purchases at first, but only for *one month*.  Then, get this, people who bought beer actually bought *more* beer after the tax!  This shows a big problem: fat taxes can just make people switch to other unhealthy things, potentially making things *worse*.  This isn't just a one-off finding; multiple studies show this \"substitution effect.\"  So, the idea that fat taxes *always* lead to healthier choices just doesn't hold up.\n\nNow, they say we can fix the negative effects of a fat tax.  We agree that careful planning and helping low-income families are important. But that doesn't solve the basic economic problems.  These taxes hit low-income families harder because they spend a bigger part of their income on food.  Help programs can be useful, but they're not a magic bullet. They can create complicated systems and mess with how the market works, potentially causing *more* problems.\n\nLet's talk about the *real* benefits of a fat tax: the economic ones. These taxes bring in a lot of money that can go *directly* into public health programs.  Denmark's fat tax, for example, brought in \u20ac160 million a year!  That's like winning the lottery for public health!  Think of what that money could do: programs to prevent obesity, educational campaigns, and better access to healthy food, especially in communities that need it most.  This kind of investment can create real, lasting improvements in everyone's health.\n\nAnd there's more.  This money can also help with the huge costs of healthcare for diet-related diseases.  Think about heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.  These diseases put a massive strain on healthcare systems everywhere.  The money from a fat tax can help pay for preventative care, research, and treatment, improving public health *and* making healthcare systems stronger in the long run.\n\nFinally, fat taxes encourage food companies to make their products healthier.  When there's a tax on sugar, companies want to lower the sugar in their products to avoid paying more.  This slowly but surely makes the food we buy healthier.  Studies show that taxes on sugary drinks have already led to lower sugar content, proving that taxes can push the food industry in a healthier direction.  This works *with* public health initiatives to create a healthier environment for everyone.\n\nSo, while the other side has some points, they don't address the big economic and public health benefits of a fat tax.  The money it brings in, the push for healthier products, and the chance to help low-income communities outweigh the potential downsides.  Let's support this and invest in a healthier, fairer future for all of us.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Mytton, O. T., et al. (2020).

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent argues that a fat tax effectively reduces unhealthy food consumption, encourages healthier choices, mitigates negative impacts on low-income families, and generates revenue for public health. However, their arguments rest on a flawed understanding of consumer behavior, a short-sighted view of economic realities, and a disregard for potential unintended consequences. We contend that a fat tax, while seemingly well-intentioned, ultimately fails to achieve its stated goals and may even exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nFirst, the opponent points to the Hungary sugar tax as evidence of the effectiveness of such taxes. While we acknowledge the observed reduction in sugar consumption in certain beverages, this example overlooks the complexity of consumer behavior.  The study they cited, while showing a decrease in *taxed* sugar-sweetened beverages, fails to account for the substitution effect, where consumers may switch to other, potentially equally unhealthy, untaxed products (1).  For a fat tax to be truly effective, it must address a comprehensive range of unhealthy foods, not just a select few.  Therefore, focusing solely on the Hungary example provides an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of how a broader fat tax would impact overall dietary habits and public health outcomes.  By failing to address this key issue, the opponent's argument for the effectiveness of a fat tax is significantly weakened.\n\nSecond, the opponent argues that higher prices inherently lead to healthier choices. However, this assumption ignores the complex interplay of economic factors and consumer preferences. The study they cited, showing temporary reductions in soft drink purchases, is limited by its short timeframe and fails to capture the longer-term dynamics of consumer behavior (2). Longer-term studies, like Andreyeva et al. (2010),  demonstrate that while initial price sensitivity may exist,  consumers often adjust their spending habits over time, sometimes even increasing consumption of other, less healthy substitutes (2). This underscores the importance of considering the broader economic context and the potential for unintended consequences when evaluating the impact of a fat tax on consumer choices.  Ultimately, their argument fails to demonstrate a consistent, long-term shift towards healthier diets as a direct result of price increases.\n\nThird, the opponent's claim that subsidies can fully mitigate the regressive impact of a fat tax on low-income families is overly optimistic.  While subsidies can certainly help improve access to healthy foods, they do not entirely address the fundamental issue of affordability.  Drewnowski and Eichelsdoerfer (2009) highlight the persistent economic challenges faced by low-income families in accessing nutritious diets, even with subsidies in place (3). Implementing a fat tax without addressing the underlying economic disparities could exacerbate existing inequalities, placing a disproportionate burden on those least able to afford it.  Therefore, the opponent's mitigation strategy, while well-intentioned, fails to adequately address the core issue of economic disparity and its impact on healthy food choices.\n\nFinally, the opponent emphasizes the economic benefits of a fat tax, particularly the revenue generated for public health programs.  While we acknowledge this potential revenue stream, it's crucial to recognize that economic benefits alone do not justify a policy that potentially harms vulnerable populations and fails to demonstrably improve overall public health. Our framework of net societal benefit requires considering *both* the economic and health impacts of a policy. The opponent's narrow focus on revenue ignores the potential negative consequences outlined above and thus provides an incomplete picture of the true societal costs and benefits of a fat tax. A truly beneficial policy must improve public health outcomes without exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nReference:\n(1) Powell, L. M., et al. (2013).

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Existing evidence concerning their effects comes largely from simulation studies and trials in closed settings, both of which have limitations. Rigorous evaluation of actual taxes may provide richer evidence with greater external validity to support policy making. This article describes existing evaluation studies and outlines an implicit underlying theoretical framework for how taxes are expected to affect health. It then explores three important issues for future studies: selection of an appropriate evaluative perspective (comparing realist and biomedical experimental paradigms); approaches to causal inference; and the challenge of a low signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that evaluation should be informed by a realist perspective as well as making appropriate use of established empirical quasi-experimental approaches to testing causal effects. This should be underpinned by a theoretical framework that acknowledges complexity and the potential diversity of impacts.

Among the various policy options, unhealthy food and beverage taxes have gained attention as a potentially effective intervention to reduce non-nutritive caloric intake, while raising government funds for health promotion programs at the community level. Yet in many countries, including in Israel, such proposals have not gained broad support. Cities in both United States and Mexico have found that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumption. Yet the food industry has successfully fought many such policies. Looking forward, those supporting taxation policies will need to provide clear evidence, a compelling use of funds raised, a convincing answer to industry claims, and attention to equity in implementation. With no easy fixes in sight to obesity, it is likely that taxes will remain viable - if contested - options for the foreseeable future.

Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0  15 January 2018 Abstract The global burden of obesity leads to significant morbidity and has major economic implications. In April 2018, Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle this using fiscal measures when the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy is introduced. We review recent evidence from natural experiments of the impact of health-related food and drink taxes on consumer behaviour, and discuss the possible consequences of these approaches on purchases and health. We highlight some of the potential indirect consequences and the importance of robust prospective evaluation. Keywords  In recent decades, the global burden of obesity and related conditions has surged. In 2014, 13\u00a0% of the world's population were obese(1), with an estimated cost to the global economy of $2 trillion(2). Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle the consequences of obesity using fiscal measures when the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) is introduced in April, 2018(3). Recent data on the impact of health-related food and drink taxes from natural experimental evaluations are allowing us to better understand how fiscal measures affect behaviour. In this review, we draw on this new evidence and discuss how health-related food and drink taxes might change purchasing habits and improve health.  Why implement food and drink taxes?  Unhealthy diets are the second leading behavioural risk factor behind tobacco for all-cause morbidity and mortality in the UK(4). A poor diet can cause disease both directly and via mediating factors such as weight gain and high blood pressure. As well as the energetic contributions of energy-dense food and drinks, saturated fat leads to CVD(Reference ",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Would taxes change buying behavior in meaningful and impactful ways? Would they lead to improved public health? And is it viable (and fair) to implement such policies on a national level?

Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

Abstract Cost-effective, sustainable strategies are urgently required to curb the global obesity epidemic. To date, fiscal policies such as taxes and subsidies have been driven largely by imperatives to raise revenue or increase supply, rather than to change population behaviours. This paper reviews the economic evaluation literature around the use of fiscal policies to prevent obesity. The cost-effectiveness literature is limited, and more robust economic evaluation studies are required. However, uncertainty and gaps in the effectiveness evidence base need to be addressed first: more studies are needed that collect \u2018real-world\u2019 empirical data, and larger studies with more robust designs and longer follow-up timeframes are required. Reliability of cross-price elasticity data needs to be investigated, and greater consideration given to moderators of intervention effects and the sustainability of outcomes. Economic evaluations should adopt a societal perspective, incorporate a broader spectrum of economic costs and consider other factors likely to affect the implementation of fiscal measures. The paucity of recent cost-effectiveness studies means that definitive conclusions about the value for mo",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being).  What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity. What did we do?

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Taxes on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) reduce the sale, purchase and consumption of those foods, according to a new peer-reviewed analysis of evidence from around the world from Imperial College Business School. This can lead to lower rates of obesity and other diet-related health problems, especially when taxes are combined with subsidies for healthier foods. The review also notes that higher rates of tax are more likely to reduce HFSS food consumption and obesity, and the response is most pronounced among lower-income groups. Global findings The review explores findings from 20 studies worldwide, in countries including Mexico, the United States, Canada, Hungary, Denmark, the Netherlands, Singapore and New Zealand, highlighting the global potential of taxes on HFSS foods. To date, only 16 countries have implemented taxes on HFSS foods, and the review incorporates some of these, alongside experimental studies. In Mexico, an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, including sweets, chocolates, sugary cereals, crisps, and salty snacks, saw a reduction in the sale of taxed foods of 18% in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers. Low-income groups, who were greater consumers of the taxed foods beforehand, showed the biggest drop in consumption once the tax was implemented. Findings from North America and New Zealand also suggest that a low-rate tax or a tax without subsidies for healthier foods introduced in parallel, might only be effective in raising government revenues. To really impact consumption levels and obesity, the authors found that high tax rates and subsidies for healthier foods \u2013 such as foods with no added sugar or salt, foods low in saturated fat, whole-grain foods, and fruit and vegetable-based opti",

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

Existing evidence concerning their effects comes largely from simulation studies and trials in closed settings, both of which have limitations. Rigorous evaluation of actual taxes may provide richer evidence with greater external validity to support policy making. This article describes existing evaluation studies and outlines an implicit underlying theoretical framework for how taxes are expected to affect health. It then explores three important issues for future studies: selection of an appropriate evaluative perspective (comparing realist and biomedical experimental paradigms); approaches to causal inference; and the challenge of a low signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that evaluation should be informed by a realist perspective as well as making appropriate use of established empirical quasi-experimental approaches to testing causal effects. This should be underpinned by a theoretical framework that acknowledges complexity and the potential diversity of impacts.

This policy-level debate curiously neglects how an understanding of consumer behavior and marketing could offer insight to this question. To address this, a six-month field experiment was conducted in an American city of 62,000 where half of the 113 households recruited into the study faced a 10% tax on calorie-dense foods and beverages and half did not. The tax resulted in a short-term (1-month) decrease in soft drink purchases, but no decrease over a 3-month or 6-month period. Moreover, in beer-purchasing households, this tax led to increased purchases of beer. To marketing scholars, this underscores th",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes.

Powell, Institute for Health Research and Policy and Department of Economics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 West Roosevelt, Room 558, Chicago, IL 60608 (email: powelll@uic.edu). Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0  15 January 2018 Abstract The global burden of obesity leads to significant morbidity and has major economic implications. In April 2018, Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle this using fiscal measures when the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy is introduced. We review recent evidence from natural experiments of the impact of health-related food and drink taxes on consumer behaviour, and discuss the possible consequences of these approaches on purchases and health. We highlight some of the potential indirect consequences and the importance of robust prospective evaluation. Keywords  In recent decades, the global burden of obesity and related conditions has surged. In 2014, 13\u00a0% of the world's population were obese(1), with an estimated cost to the global economy of $2 trillion(2). Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle the consequences of obesity using fiscal measures when the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) is introduced in April, 2018(3). Recent data on the impact of health-related food and drink taxes from natural experimental evaluations are allowing us to better understand how fiscal measures affect behaviour. In this review, we draw on this new evidence and discuss how health-related food and drink taxes might change purchasing habits and improve health.  Why implement food and drink taxes?

This paper aimed to summarise recent evidence of the impact of taxes on unhealthy foods and beverages on food purchases, and discuss opportunities to advance knowledge and policy impact. Recent Findings Evaluations of taxes on unhealthy foods and beverages have shown reductions in purchases of targeted unhealthy products and nutrients. Similarly, data from multiple sources demonstrate that as prices of unhealthy foods and beverages increase, purchase volume decreases. However, studies indicate potential for substitution to non-taxed unhealthy foods, which needs to be factored into taxation design. Summary Taxes on unhealthy foods and beverages are a promising strategy to improve population diets. Further research is required to understand food industry responses to tax implementation, as well as the impact of taxes on population and planetary health outcomes.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a tax on the fat content of foods. We were interested in how a tax affected the: Search date: We included evidence published up to September 2019. What we found We found two studies from Denmark, conducted during 2011 to 2012.

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

However, there is very limited evidence of the effect of food taxation in a real-life setting, as most evidence is based on simulation studies. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Danish tax on saturated fat in terms of changes in nutritional quality of the diet, that is, changes in saturated fat consumption, as well as other non-targeted dietary measures, and to model the associated changes in mortality for different age groups and genders. Subjects/Methods: On the basis of household scanner data, we estimate the impact of the tax on consumption of saturated fat, unsaturated fat, salt, fruit, vegetables and fibre. The resultant changes in dietary quality are then used as inputs into a comparative risk assessment model (PRIME (Preventable Risk Integrated ModEl)) to estimate the effect of these changes on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and mortality. Results: The tax resulted in a 4.0% reduction in saturated fat intake. Vegetable consumption increased, and salt consumption increased for most individuals, except younger females. We find a modelled reduction in mortality with 123 lives saved annually, 76 of them below 75 years equal to 0.4% of all",

Powell, Institute for Health Research and Policy and Department of Economics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 West Roosevelt, Room 558, Chicago, IL 60608 (email: powelll@uic.edu). Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

This policy-level debate curiously neglects how an understanding of consumer behavior and marketing could offer insight to this question. To address this, a six-month field experiment was conducted in an American city of 62,000 where half of the 113 households recruited into the study faced a 10% tax on calorie-dense foods and beverages and half did not. The tax resulted in a short-term (1-month) decrease in soft drink purchases, but no decrease over a 3-month or 6-month period. Moreover, in beer-purchasing households, this tax led to increased purchases of beer. To marketing scholars, this underscores th",

While much remains unresolved, the available evidence does not favor subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables or taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) as obesity policy. Taxes on specific nutrients are generally found to be more effective in reducing calorie consumption and body weight as well as economically more efficient. However, any food tax will be regressive and could have other undesirable unintended consequences, and it is not clear that it would be politically feasible to set any such tax at a high enough rate to have a worthwhile effect on reducing obesity.

Indeed, the established theory and evidence on the economics of the \u201cfixed charge\u201d (Alchian and Allen 1964; Barzel 1976) suggests that the opposite effect is likely: imposition of a fixed per unit cost (as with a per unit tax) reduces the relative price of higher quality and tends to induce quality upgrading. SSBs are disfavored in a number of countries, meaning that they are taxed at a higher rate than general foods and beverages. Countries that have implemented such a policy include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom (Jou and Techakehakij 2012). For these countries, the VAT on SSBs ranges between 19% and 30%. Thow et al. (2011) s",

PEER REVIEWED  Abstract Introduction Food pricing policies to promote healthy diets, such as taxes, price manipulations, and food subsidies, have been tested in different settings. However, little consensus exists about the effect of these policies on the availability of healthy and unhealthy foods, on what foods consumers buy, or on the impact of food purchases on consumer health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of studies of the effect of food-pricing interventions on retail sales and on consumer purchasing and consumption of healthy foods and beverages. Methods We used MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library to conduct a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles related to studies of food pricing policies. We selected articles that were published in English from January 2000 through December 2016 on the following types of studies: 1) real-world experimental studies (randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments); 2) population studies of people or retail stores in middle-income and high-income countries; 3) pricing interventions alone or in combination with other strategies (price promotions, coupons, taxes, or cash-back rebates), excluding studies of vending-machine or online sales; and 4) out",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

The 2017\u20132018 packaged food purchase data among U.S. households were used to derive household income- and composition-specific demand elasticities across 22 food and beverage categories. Policy simulations, conducted in 2022\u20132023, assessed the impact of national taxes on unhealthy ultraprocessed food and beverage purchases, both separately and alongside subsidies for minimally processed foods and beverages targeted to low-income households. Resultant nutritional implications are reported on the basis of changes in purchased calories and nutrients of concern. In addition, financial implications for both households and the federal government are projected. A sugar-based tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would lower both volume and calories purchased with the largest impact on low-income households without children. Meanwhile, targeted subsidies would increase fruit, vegetable, and healthier drink purchases without substantially increasing calories. Under tax simulations, low-income households would make larger reductions in their absolute volume and calorie purchases of taxed foods and beverages than their higher-income counterparts, suggesting that these policies, if implemented, could help narrow nutritional disparities. Levying national taxes on unhealthy ultraprocessed foods/beverages and offering targeted subsidies for minimally processed foods/beverages could promote healthier food choices among low-income households.

Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

Abstract Objective To assess the effect of food taxes and subsidies on diet, body weight and health through a systematic review of the literature. Methods We searched the English-language published and grey literature for empirical and modelling studies on the effects of monetary subsidies or taxes levied on specific food products on consumption habits, body weight and chronic conditions. Empirical studies were dealing with an actual tax, while modelling studies predicted outcomes based on a hypothetical tax or subsidy. Findings Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria: 13 were from the peer-reviewed literature and 11 were published on line. There were 8\u00a0empirical and 16 modelling studies. Nine studies assessed the impact of taxes on food consumption only, 5\u00a0on consumption and body weight, 4\u00a0on consumption and disease and 6\u00a0on body weight only. In general, taxes and subsidies influenced consumption in the desired direction, with larger taxes being associated w",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

Existing evidence concerning their effects comes largely from simulation studies and trials in closed settings, both of which have limitations. Rigorous evaluation of actual taxes may provide richer evidence with greater external validity to support policy making. This article describes existing evaluation studies and outlines an implicit underlying theoretical framework for how taxes are expected to affect health. It then explores three important issues for future studies: selection of an appropriate evaluative perspective (comparing realist and biomedical experimental paradigms); approaches to causal inference; and the challenge of a low signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that evaluation should be informed by a realist perspective as well as making appropriate use of established empirical quasi-experimental approaches to testing causal effects. This should be underpinned by a theoretical framework that acknowledges complexity and the potential diversity of impacts.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Customers trickle in and out, picking up bags of chips and ordering sandwiches from the deli. Even so, owner Eduard Medina looks worried. \u201cThe store is slow now \u2014 very slow,\u201d he says. Medina says it\u2019s been that way ever since Philadelphia passed its controversial soda tax, which bumped up prices on sweetened drinks by 1.5 cents per ounce. In real terms, that\u2019s meant increases ranging from 18 cents for a can of soda, to nearly $2 for gallon jugs of iced tea. Those bumps have added up for Medina\u2019s customers, too. \u201cYeah I noticed it \u2014 that\u2019s why I don\u2019t buy it that often,\u201d says customer Erica Burgess, as she pays for a bottle of Sprite, and another of Coke.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

Taxes on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) reduce the sale, purchase and consumption of those foods, according to a new analysis of evidence from around the world from Imperial College Business School. The paper is published in the journal Food Policy. This can lead to lower rates of obesity and other diet-related health problems, especially when taxes are combined with subsidies for healthier foods. The review also notes that higher rates of tax are more likely to reduce HFSS food consumption and obesity, and the response is most pronounced among lower-income groups. Global findings The review explores findings from 20 studies worldwide, in countries including Mexico, the United States, Canada, Hungary, Denmark, the Netherlands, Singapore and New Zealand, highlighting the global potential of taxes on HFSS foods. To date, only 16 countries have implemented taxes on HFSS foods, and the review incorporates some of these, alongside experimental studies. In Mexico, an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, including sweets, chocolates, sugary cereals, crisps, and salty snacks, saw a reduction in the sale of taxed foods of 18% in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers. Low-income groups, who were greater consumers of the taxed foods beforehand, showed the biggest drop in consumption once the tax was implemented.

But what should happen with the money raised by these taxes? A new study published in the American Journal of Preventative Medicine explores the effects of combining a sugar-based tax on beverages with targeted subsidies for minimally processed foods and drinks. Researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill developed a model to simulate what would happen if national-level taxes on less healthy, ultra-processed foods and beverages were used to fund subsidies for members of low-income households participating in food assistance programs to spend specifically on fruits, vegetables, healthy proteins and unsweetened drinks. They found that this combined policy scenario would likely lead low-income households to improve the nutritional quality of their grocery purchases without increasing their overall costs or negatively impacting consumer satisfaction. Targeted taxes already have been proven to reduce the purchase and consumption of sugary drinks, which could potentially save millions of years of life globally by reducing chronic diseases caused by excess sugar and calories. However, while more than 60 countries and smaller jurisdictions worldwide have implemented health-focused sugary drink taxes, relatively few have earmarked the revenue raised to subsidize healthy food purchases. In the United States, studies evaluating programs that provide additional cash benefits for food assistance participants to spend on fruits and vegetables consistently find that they increase consumers\u2019 purchase and intake of targeted products. The new study\u2019s findings support a novel policy approach, combining both policy types to expand low-income households\u2019 access to additional healthier alternatives.

Among the various policy options, unhealthy food and beverage taxes have gained attention as a potentially effective intervention to reduce non-nutritive caloric intake, while raising government funds for health promotion programs at the community level. Yet in many countries, including in Israel, such proposals have not gained broad support. Cities in both United States and Mexico have found that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumption. Yet the food industry has successfully fought many such policies. Looking forward, those supporting taxation policies will need to provide clear evidence, a compelling use of funds raised, a convincing answer to industry claims, and attention to equity in implementation. With no easy fixes in sight to obesity, it is likely that taxes will remain viable \u2013 if contested \u2013 options for the foreseeable future.

Login Alert Article contents Socio-economic factors associated with a healthy diet: results from the E3N study   Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0  13 March 2017 Abstract To identify individual and contextual socio-economic factors associated with a healthy diet. Dietary data from a large cohort study were used to derive two mutually exclusive dietary patterns through a latent class analysis. Associations between dietary patterns and socio-economic factors were studied with logistic regression. E3N, a French prospective cohort study composed of women recruited from a national health insurance plan covering people working in the national education system. E3N participants (n 73 031) with dietary and socio-economic data available. The \u2018Healthy\u2019 pattern was characterized by a large consumption of fruits and vegetables and the \u2018Less Healthy\u2019 pattern by a large consumption of pizza and processed meat. When all socio-economic factors were analysed together, all of the individual factors considered were associated with a healthy diet (e.g. women with three or more children were less likely to follow a healthy diet v. women with no children, OR (95 % CI): 0\u00b770 (0\u00b766, 0\u00b775)) while the contextual factors associated with a healthy diet included the size of the agglomeration of residence and the area of birth and residence (e.g. women living in the West of France were less likely to follow a healthy diet v. those living in the South of France: 0\u00b778 (0\u00b772, 0\u00b783)). We demonstrated that individual and contextual factors are both associated with diet. Rather than focusing only on individual factors, we recommend future studies or public health and nutritional strategies on diet to consider both types of factors.

Abstract Objective: We aimed to explore the relationship between socio-economic characteristics and sustainable dietary patterns. Design: Dietary data were derived from a web-based FFQ. Diet sustainability was evaluated using a modified Sustainable Diet Index, comprising nutritional, environmental and cultural components (higher scores expressing higher sustainability). The socio-economic position markers were education, household income and occupation status. Multi-adjusted linear and Poisson regression models were used to assess the cross-sectional association of the markers of socio-economic status with a sustainable diet and sustainability subcomponents, respectively. Setting: France. Participants: 29 119 NutriNet-Sant\u00e9 participants.

Abstract Socio-economic status (SES) has been associated with measures of diet quality; however, such measures have not directly captured overall eating practices in individuals. Based on the factor analysis of fifty-six food groups from FFQ, associations between patterns of food consumption and SES were examined in a nationwide sample of 17 062 black (34\u00b76 %) and white participants (age >45 years) from the REasons for Geographic And Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. Logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, racial group and geographic region were used to examine adherence to five emergent dietary patterns (convenience, plant-based, sweets/fats, southern and alcohol/salads) according to four levels each of individual education, household income and community-level SES. Further models assessed adherence to these dietary patterns by racial group, and an overall model including both racial groups examined whether the relationships between SES and adherence to these dietary patterns differed among black and white participants. For all the three measures of SES, higher SES had been associated with greater adherence to plant-based and alcohol/salads patterns, but lower adherence to sweets/fats and southern patterns. Statistically significant differences between black and white participants were observed in the associations betwee",

Abstract Investigations of the contribution of food costs to socioeconomic inequalities in diet quality may have been limited by the use of estimated (vs. actual) food expenditures, not accounting for where individuals shop, and possible reverse mediation between food expenditures and healthiness of food choices. This study aimed to explore the extent to which food expenditure mediates socioeconomic inequalities in the healthiness of household food choices. Observational panel data on take-home food and beverage purchases, including expenditure, throughout 2010 were obtained for 24,879 UK households stratified by occupational social class. Purchases of (1) fruit and vegetables and (2) less-healthy foods/beverages indicated healthiness of choices. Supermarket choice was determined by whether households ever visited market-defined high-price and/or low-price supermarkets. Results showed that higher occupational social class was significantly associated with greater food expenditure, which was in turn associated with healthier purchasing. In mediation analyses, 63% of the socioeconomic differences in choices of less-healthy foods/beverages were mediated by expenditure, and 36% for fruit and vegetables, but these figures were reduced to 53% and 31% respectively ",

Download Free PDF A&nbsp;systematic review of the effectiveness of taxes on nonalcoholic beverages and high-in-fat foods as a means to prevent obesity trends 2013, ClinicoEconomics and Outcomes Research Background: As part of the efforts to curb obesity, a new focus seems to be put on taxing foods that are perceived as being associated with obesity (eg, sugar-sweetened beverages and foods high in fat, sugar, and salt content) as a policy instrument to promote healthier diets. Objective: To assess the possible effects of such taxation policies by identifying and analyzing all studies which investigate the impact of price increases on consumption, caloric intake, or weight outcomes. Methods: Electronic data bases were searched with appropriate terms and their combinations. Thereafter, abstracts were reviewed and studies were selected based on predefined criteria. The characteristics of the selected studies and the results were extracted in a special form and consequently were reviewed and synthesized. Results: Price increase may lead to a reduction in consumption of the targeted products, but the subsequent effect on caloric intake may be much smaller. Only a limited number of the identified studies reported weight outcomes, most of which are either insignificant or very small in magnitude to make any improvement in public health. Conclusion: The effectiveness of a taxation policy to curb obesity is doubtful and available evidence in most studies is not very straightforward due to the multiple complexities in consumer behavior and the underling substitution effects. There is need to investigate in-depth the potential underlying mechanisms and the relationship between price-increase policies, obesity, and public health outcomes.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue. See also: How to Stay Sane When the World is Crumbling Around You The Benefits of a Fat Tax Despite the controversies surrounding fat taxes, proponents argue they offer several potential benefits.

Abstract Objective To assess the effect of food taxes and subsidies on diet, body weight and health through a systematic review of the literature. Methods We searched the English-language published and grey literature for empirical and modelling studies on the effects of monetary subsidies or taxes levied on specific food products on consumption habits, body weight and chronic conditions. Empirical studies were dealing with an actual tax, while modelling studies predicted outcomes based on a hypothetical tax or subsidy. Findings Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria: 13 were from the peer-reviewed literature and 11 were published on line. There were 8\u00a0empirical and 16 modelling studies. Nine studies assessed the impact of taxes on food consumption only, 5\u00a0on consumption and body weight, 4\u00a0on consumption and disease and 6\u00a0on body weight only. In general, taxes and subsidies influenced consumption in the desired direction, with larger taxes being associated w",

Among the various policy options, unhealthy food and beverage taxes have gained attention as a potentially effective intervention to reduce non-nutritive caloric intake, while raising government funds for health promotion programs at the community level. Yet in many countries, including in Israel, such proposals have not gained broad support. Cities in both United States and Mexico have found that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumption. Yet the food industry has successfully fought many such policies. Looking forward, those supporting taxation policies will need to provide clear evidence, a compelling use of funds raised, a convincing answer to industry claims, and attention to equity in implementation. With no easy fixes in sight to obesity, it is likely that taxes will remain viable \u2013 if contested \u2013 options for the foreseeable future. With more than a quarter of global mortality now attributed to diseases related to obesity, including cardiovascular disease and stroke [1], it is no surprise that policymakers are considering a range of potential respo",

The Laspeyres index calculates the change in prices paid relative to the initial pattern of consumption; the Paasche index is similar except that it weights prices paid using the new pattern of consumption. \u00a0A greater difference between the two indices reveals greater substitution and responsiveness to the policy. The figure above shows that 25-30% of \u00a0the low income consumers paid more for food after the price policy (they had an index greater than 100), and given the similarity of the two red lines, were less responsive (perhaps because of being more habit prone) than the richer consumers. \u00a0Moreover, at the individual level, the Paasche index was higher than the Laspeyres index for 35.9% of low income individuals. \u00a0These individuals did not shift their diet in the intended direction.

Abstract This study examines the association between financial worries and psychological distress among US adults and tests its moderating effects by gender, marital status, employment status, education, and income levels. Data were derived from the cross-sectional 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) of the adult population. The hierarchical regression analysis revealed that higher financial worries were significantly associated with higher psychological distress. Additionally, the association between financial worries and psychological distress was more pronounced among the unmarried, the unemployed, lower-income households, and renters than their counterparts. The findings suggest that accessible financial counseling programs and public health intervention programs are needed to mitigate financial worries and its negative influences on overall psychological health, with greater attention devoted to vulnerable populations.

However, research evaluating the complex behavioral and psychological impact of the pandemic on both obese and underweight students is currently limited. We used data from a survey conducted from March to April 2020 across 2534 students enrolled in seven US universities. We examined whether the associations between taking various behaviors and being obese and underweight students are unidimensional, or varies based on various negative emotions, and their sociodemographic characteristics. Also, we checked whether emotions of obese and underweight groups are impaired, which consequently might impact taking various cautionary behaviors. The results highlight complex relationships between being obese and underweight students and other considered variables. For instance, despite the associated risk, it was found that obese students are associated with less fear, guilt and irritability due to the pandemic. However, those associations vary based on factors such as level of educations. In addition, while obese students are less likely to avoid a large group of people, the impact changes based on gender. Lack of precautions and emotions is despite the increased risk of hospitalization and death associated with obese and underweight groups. Finally, it was found that there are negative and stable",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Especially in terms of communicable disease, the risk is more concentrated in urban poor areas where basic amenities are inadequate. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the effective community-based interventions (CBIs) aimed at preventing and controlling infectious diseases among the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods This systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) guidelines. A comprehensive search across five major databases was conducted to capture literature on CBIs published between 2011 and 2021. Scientific articles of any design that reported any type of CBIs effective in preventing and controlling infectious diseases (tuberculosis, diarrhea, typhoid, dengue, hepatitis B and C, influenza, and COVID-19) were included. Screening and selection of studies were done by two pairs of independent researchers using the predefined eligibility criteria. The risk of bias in included studies was assessed using the modified checklist outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP). Analysis of effective CBIs was guided by the conceptual framework for integrated CBIs for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), and narrative synthesis was carried out. Geographical restrictions were limited to LMICs and papers published in English. Results Out of 18,260 identified papers, 20 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review.

The Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Across the U.S. (REACH U.S.) is a CDC-funded national program whose goal is to eliminate racial and ethnic health disparities in the United States. In 2007, just 40 communities were funded through the REACH program. These kinds of programs can be cost-effective. A study by Trust for America\u2019s Health, entitled Prevention for a Healthier America, found that investing $10 per person per year in proven community-based programs to increase physical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking and other tobacco use, could save the country more than $16 billion annually within five years.

Abstract The vast majority of patients with chronic respiratory disease live in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Paradoxically, relevant interventions often fail to be effective particularly in these settings, as LMICs lack solid evidence on how to implement interventions successfully. Therefore, we aimed to identify factors critical to the implementation of lung health interventions in LMICs, and weigh their level of evidence. This systematic review followed Cochrane methodology and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) reporting standards. We searched eight databases without date or language restrictions in July 2019, and included all relevant original, peer-reviewed articles.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

The theoretical analysis allows deriving expressions for revenue effects and deadweight loss in a general equilibrium setting. Using data for Germany, the quantification suggests that introducing a modest FAT with a rate of 4% results in a revenue gain of about EUR 1.8 bn.

Comparing these results with Buettner and Erbe (2013), this chapter shows that the introduction of a FAT of 4% would generate similar revenue and slightly larger welfare gains as a repeal of the financial sector Value Added Tax (VAT) exemption.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

These taxes have not yet been implemented in the Czech Republic, in contrast to some other, mainly European countries. However, the introduction of a\u00a0fat tax has been discussed frequently in the Czech Republic during the last few years; here, we provide empirical evidence in order for this public debate to be better informed. We use detailed microeconomic data to estimate the impact of potential fat taxes on household expenditure and government revenues in the Czech Republic. We evaluate the impact of three types of fat taxes: ad valorem, specific per kilogram of product and specific per kilogram of fat. We simulate these in such a\u00a0way that they all raise the same budget revenues as a\u00a010% ad valorem tax on fat-rich products. Accounting for higher food expenditures in the aggregate national accounts than in the detailed microeconomic data results into higher budget revenues, 7.3 and 6.1 billion Czech korunas, respectively. Overall we find, and thus confirm the overwhelming evidence from other countries, that fat taxes are regressive in income.

But there's one potential tool you may not have heard of, though it's been discussed for more than a decade. A June 2007 study suggests that a \"fat tax\" -- placing a tax on fatty or unhealthy foods -- might save thousands of lives and reduce health care costs. Also called the Twinkie tax, the fat tax concept was pioneered by Kelly D. Brownell, a professor of psychology at Yale University, who wrote about it in the New York Times in 1994. Dr. Brownell outlined two proposals, the first of which suggested a 7 percent to 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods. The tax revenue would then subsidize the sale of healthy foods. The tax would apply to broad types of foods or target certain fatty foods. Brownell's alternate proposal stated that a lesser tax could be used to fund public programs promoting healthy and responsible eating. Advertisement Researchers at Oxford University and Nottingham University claim that a 17.5 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on unhealthy food could save up to 3,200 lives a year. The tax would effectively save lives by reducing demands for unhealthy foods, consequently reducing occurrences of serious complications from obesity, such as heart attacks and diabetes. In determining how demand would be lowered, the researchers calculated how higher prices on unhealthy foods would affect the market for those products. The scientists created scenarios involving three different potential methods of taxation. The first model taxed only foods loaded with saturated fat. But this taxation method simply caused consumers to switch to other salty, unhealthy foods, which resulted in even more severe health consequences. It also increased food costs for the average family by 3.2 percent [Source: Guardian Unlimited]. The second taxation scheme assigned various foods a rating, ",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Highlights 7 U.S. cities have a sugar-sweetened-beverage tax, raising $134 million annually. Early childhood programs received the largest investment of tax revenues ($58M). Community improvements (e.g., rec centers & libraries) were second largest ($21M). Increasing healthy food and beverage access (e.g., produce subsidies) received $17M. 85% of revenues supported projects and programs in impacted communities. Keywords: Sugar-sweetened beverages, Taxes, Revenue allocation, Equity, Health policy Abstract We sought to describe how revenues from sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) excise taxes in 7 U.S. cities are being allocated, who is benefiting from these investments, and whether allocations are consistent with the original intent of tax legislation. We collected information from public documents and key informants about allocations in the most recent fiscal year available (ranging from 2018 to 2021). Across the 7 U.S. cities with taxes, the average annual revenue from SSB taxes totaled $133.9\u00a0M. In the fiscal year studied, cities allocated a total of $133.2\u00a0M in SSB tax revenues. Human and community capital investments totaled $89.6\u00a0M (67% of all allocations) funding early childhood developmen",

Among the various policy options, unhealthy food and beverage taxes have gained attention as a potentially effective intervention to reduce non-nutritive caloric intake, while raising government funds for health promotion programs at the community level. Yet in many countries, including in Israel, such proposals have not gained broad support. Cities in both United States and Mexico have found that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumption. Yet the food industry has successfully fought many such policies. Looking forward, those supporting taxation policies will need to provide clear evidence, a compelling use of funds raised, a convincing answer to industry claims, and attention to equity in implementation. With no easy fixes in sight to obesity, it is likely that taxes will remain viable \u2013 if contested \u2013 options for the foreseeable future. With more than a quarter of global mortality now attributed to diseases related to obesity, including cardiovascular disease and stroke [1], it is no surprise that policymakers are considering a range of potential respo",

Advertisement The public health impacts of a fat tax  European Journal of Clinical Nutrition volume\u00a065,\u00a0pages 427\u2013433 (2011)Cite this article  9308 Accesses 57 Citations 14 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Abstract Background/Objectives: Previous studies have analysed impacts on average intakes. Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample. Results: The subsidy brings mean levels of fruit and vegetable consumption in line with dietary recommendations, but the tax is insufficient to achieve this goal for fat intakes. Once the changes in diet are converted into changes in the risks of disease, the impacts of the policy are negligible. A substantial part of the population continues to consume an unhealthy diet. Conclusion: Fiscally based interventions should be considered amongst a suite of policy interventions, which also include policies aimed at improving the po",

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

Among the various policy options, unhealthy food and beverage taxes have gained attention as a potentially effective intervention to reduce non-nutritive caloric intake, while raising government funds for health promotion programs at the community level. Yet in many countries, including in Israel, such proposals have not gained broad support. Cities in both United States and Mexico have found that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumption. Yet the food industry has successfully fought many such policies. Looking forward, those supporting taxation policies will need to provide clear evidence, a compelling use of funds raised, a convincing answer to industry claims, and attention to equity in implementation. With no easy fixes in sight to obesity, it is likely that taxes will remain viable \u2013 if contested \u2013 options for the foreseeable future.

While much remains unresolved, the available evidence does not favor subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables or taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) as obesity policy. Taxes on specific nutrients are generally found to be more effective in reducing calorie consumption and body weight as well as economically more efficient. However, any food tax will be regressive and could have other undesirable unintended consequences, and it is not clear that it would be politically feasible to set any such tax at a high enough rate to have a worthwhile effect on reducing obesity.

Indeed, the established theory and evidence on the economics of the \u201cfixed charge\u201d (Alchian and Allen 1964; Barzel 1976) suggests that the opposite effect is likely: imposition of a fixed per unit cost (as with a per unit tax) reduces the relative price of higher quality and tends to induce quality upgrading. SSBs are disfavored in a number of countries, meaning that they are taxed at a higher rate than general foods and beverages. Countries that have implemented such a policy include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom (Jou and Techakehakij 2012). For these countries, the VAT on SSBs ranges between 19% and 30%. Thow et al. (2011) s",

The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Contact  Is the fat tax really effective? Recently, some European countries, including Spain, have considered introducing new taxes to reduce their budget deficits. Among the set of measures, they have proposed a fat tax, which has the aims of not only increasing revenues, but also reducing junk food consumption, and thereby obesity rates and the concomitant health costs. Although this is what we expect from the theory, empirical evidence is revelatory of a different picture. Firstly, the tax is not fully reflected in the prices of the products that have been targeted. In fact, in the countries where the tax has been imposed, supermarkets and other food stores have played with prices and margins of other products in an attempt to avoid raising the prices of the products that are subject to taxation. For example, some firms have increased the prices of substitutes (e.g. sodas with low calories) while spreading the higher cost of taxed food onto other foods or own-branded products that typically have higher profit margins. Another interesting reaction from the supply side has been that producers have been substituting those taxed products with un-taxed products that are just as unhealthy. Additionally, they have also reduced the amount of some inputs below the legal threshold to avoid the fat tax. Ostensibly, these tricks have clearly diminished the effectiveness of the tax. On the demand side, we have also seen interesting reactions. Firstly, it is important to notice that people who consume more junk food are less responsive to a price increase than moderate consumers. Hence, the fat tax is not actually benefiting its most important target audience. Furthermore, there is an important substitution effect as all products have, on the whole, become more expensive, consumers have swi",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat.

More than a personal health issue, obesity contributes to rising healthcare costs, decreased productivity, and broader societal challenges. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), global obesity rates have nearly tripled since 1975, with over 650 million adults classified as obese\u00a0as of 2016. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\u00a0reports that 42.4% of adults were obese in 2017-2018, reflecting an upward trend that poses challenges to public health and economic stability. The Economic and Healthcare Burden of Obesity The financial impact of obesity is staggering. The World Obesity Federation\u00a0projects that by 2025, obesity could cost the global economy $1.2 trillion annually. In the U.S. alone, obesity-related healthcare costs range between $147 billion and $210 billion per year, driven by conditions like type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Indirect costs, including lost productivity and premature mortality, add an estimated $3.38 billion annually\u00a0to the economic burden. These figures underscore the urgent need for effective solutions to curb the obesity epidemic. The Role of Ultra-Processed Foods A major contributor to obesity is the widespread consumption of ultra-processed foods, which are often high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and additives. Studies link these foods to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. The affordability and convenience of ultra-processed foods make them a staple in many diets, particularly in lower-income communities, exacerbating the health disparities linked to obesity. Today\u2019s society, characterized by fast-paced living, economic inequality, and a heavily marketed food industry, creates an environment where ultra-processed foods are the easy and often preferred choice. Addressing this issue requ",

Abstract Objective To assess the effect of food taxes and subsidies on diet, body weight and health through a systematic review of the literature. Methods We searched the English-language published and grey literature for empirical and modelling studies on the effects of monetary subsidies or taxes levied on specific food products on consumption habits, body weight and chronic conditions. Empirical studies were dealing with an actual tax, while modelling studies predicted outcomes based on a hypothetical tax or subsidy. Findings Twenty-four studies met the inclusion criteria: 13 were from the peer-reviewed literature and 11 were published on line. There were 8\u00a0empirical and 16 modelling studies. Nine studies assessed the impact of taxes on food consumption only, 5\u00a0on consumption and body weight, 4\u00a0on consumption and disease and 6\u00a0on body weight only. In general, taxes and subsidies influenced consumption in the desired direction, with larger taxes being associated w",

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Study:\u00a0National taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and its association with overweight, obesity, and diabetes. Image Credit: Brent Hofacker / Shutterstock.com Efforts to reduce SSB consumption The consumption of SSBs or soft drinks has significantly increased throughout the world over the past several decades. This has been associated with rising rates of weight gain, a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, as well as a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality if consumed over the long term. Previously, the Global Burden of Disease study showed that deaths linked to soft drink intake rose between 1990 to 2019. This was accompanied by a rising number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the number of years lived with disability, the latter of which doubled during this period. In 2009, the American Heart Association (AHA) suggested that added sugars should not exceed 100 and 150 calories each day for females and males, respectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) also limits daily free sugar intake to less than 10% of daily energy intake. Many countries have imposed a tax on SSBs to raise revenue and limit their consumption. Some research shows that when the price of SSBs increases by 20%, their consumption may decline to similar levels. However, this prediction has not been supported by any study on global SSB consumption in relation to national tax policies and population health impact. The current study aimed to summarize national taxation policies on SSBs throughout the world and estimate the impact of tax laws made after 1990 on population-level metabolic parameters like obesity and type 2 diabetes.

What is obesity?  Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being).  What are fats?  Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: - saturated (mostly from animal products, such as meat, cow's milk, cheese, cream, and butter); and - unsaturated (mostly found in oils from plants and fish). Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: - reduce the overall amount of fat they eat; - limit the amount of saturated fats they eat; and - eat unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats.  Why we did this Cochrane Review   Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity.  What did we do?  We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a tax on the fat content of foods. We were interested in how a tax affected the: - total amount of fat, and saturated fats eaten; - total calories eaten; - calories eaten from all fats and saturated fats; and - rates of overweight and obesity.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity.  A fat tax aims to decrease the consumption of foods that are linked to obesity. A related idea is to tax foods that are linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.[2][3][4] In fact, eating behavior may be more responsive to price increases than to nutritional education.[5] Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.[6] However, there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals.[7]  To implement a fat tax, it is necessary to specify which food and beverage products will be targeted. This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.[8] For instance, consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake, thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.[8] Current proposals frequently single out sugar-sweetened drinks as a target for taxation.[9][10] Cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental studies have found an association between obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks.[11][12] However, experimental studies have not always found an association, and the size of the effect can be very modest.[13]  Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be regressive. Taxing foods that provide primarily calories, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem, since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations. To make a fat tax less burdensome for the poor, proponents recommen",

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Diseases Heart disease and stroke Nothing kills more Americans than heart disease and stroke. More than 944,800 Americans die of heart disease or stroke every year\u2014that's more than 1 in 3 deaths.3 These diseases take an economic toll, as well, costing our health care system $254 billion per year and causing $168 billion in lost productivity on the job.4 Costs from cardiovascular diseases are projected to hit roughly $2 trillion by 2050.5 See the health and economic benefits of high blood pressure interventions. Cancer Each year in the United States, 1.7 million people are diagnosed with cancer, and more than 600,000 die from it, making it the second leading cause of death.6 The cost of cancer care continues to rise and is expected to reach more than $240 billion by 2030.7 See the health and economic benefits of interventions for breast cancer, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, and skin cancer.

Research to date has consistently demonstrated a correlation between obesity and higher medical costs for a variety of U.S. subpopulations and specific categories of care. However, by examining associations rather than causal effects, previous studies likely underestimated the effect of obesity on medical expenditures. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the causal effect of obesity on direct medical care costs at the national and state levels. METHODS: This study is a pooled cross-sectional analysis of retrospective data from the 2001-2016 Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. Adults aged 20-65 years with a biological child living in the household were included in the study sample. Primary outcomes were individual-level medical expenditures due to obesity, overall, as well as separately by type of payer and category of medical care. Results were reported at the national level and separately for the 20 most populous states. The expenditure estimates were obtained from 2-part models o",

Abstract Over the past several decades, obesity has grown into a major global epidemic. In the United States (US), more than two-thirds of adults are now overweight and one-third is obese. In this article, we provide an overview of the state of research on the likely economic impact of the US obesity epidemic at the national level. Research to date has identified at least four major categories of economic impact linked with the obesity epidemic: direct medical costs, productivity costs, transportation costs, and human capital costs. We review current evidence on each set of costs in turn, and identify important gaps for future research and potential trends in future economic impacts of obesity. Although more comprehensive analysis of costs is needed, substantial economic impacts of obesity are identified in all four categories by existing research. The magnitude of potential economic impact underscores the importance of the obesity epidemic as a focus for policy and a topic for future research.

Using 1998 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey data, we employed 2-stage modeling to estimate annual health care expenditures associated with high body mass index (BMI) and examine interactions between demographic factors and BMI. Results. Overall, the mean per capita annual health care expenditure (converted to December 2003 dollars) was $3338 before adjustment. While the adjusted expenditure was $2127 (90% confidence interval [CI]=$1927, $2362) for a typical normal-weight White woman aged 35 to 44 years, expenditures were $2358 (90% CI=$2128, $2604) for women with BMIs of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2, $2873 (90% CI=$2530, $3236) for women with BMIs of 30 to 34.9 kg/m2, $3058 (90% CI=$2529, $3630) for women with BMIs of 35 to 39.9 kg/m2, and $3506 (90% CI=$2912, $4228) for women with BMIs of 40 kg/m2 or higher.

The objective of this study was to provide current estimates of the effect of obesity and overweight on healthcare spending overall, by service line and by payer using the National Institutes of Health classifications for BMI. Methods We used a quasi-experimental design and analyzed the data using generalized linear models and two-part models to estimate obesity- and overweight-attributable spending. Data was drawn from the 2006 and 2016 Medical Expenditures Panel Survey. We identified individuals in the different BMI classes based on self-reported height and weight. Results Total medical costs attributable to obesity rose to $126 billion per year by 2016, although the marginal cost of obesity declined for all obesity classes. The overall spending increase was due to an increase in obesity prevalence and a population shift to higher obesity classes. Obesity related spending between 2006 and 2016 was relatively constant due to decreases in inpatient spending, which were only partially offset by increases in outpatient spending. Conclusions While total obesity related spending between 2006 and 2016 was relatively constant, by examining the effect of different obesity classes and overweight, it provides insight into spend for each level of obesity and overweight across service line and payer mix. Obesity class 2 and 3 were the main factors driving spending increases, suggesting that persons over BMI of 35 should be the focus for policies focused on controlling spending, such as prevention.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the magnitude of the impact of weight on health care use patterns among Medicare Supplement insureds. Method: We estimated the impact of weight as a function of body mass index (BMI) on health care utilization and expenditures using propensity weighted multivariate regression models. The outcomes were controlled initially for demographics and socioeconomics and then additionally for chronic conditions and health status. Results: Among the 9,484 survey res",

Abstract Background Estimates of health care costs associated with excess weight are needed to inform the development of cost-effective obesity prevention efforts. However, commonly used cost estimates are not sensitive to changes in weight across the entire body mass index (BMI) distribution as they are often based on discrete BMI categories. Methods We estimated continuous BMI-related health care expenditures using data from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) 2011\u20132016 for 175,726 respondents. We adjusted BMI for self-report bias using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011\u20132016, and controlled for potential confounding between BMI and medical expenditures using a two-part model. Costs are reported in $US 2019. Results We found a J-shaped curve of medical expenditures by BMI, with higher costs for females and the lowest expenditures occurring at a BMI of 20.5 for adult females and 23.5 for adult males.

Such taxes could save Australia AUD$3.4 billion (USD$2.3 billion) \"over the remaining lifetimes of all Australians alive in 2010,\" said the study, led by Linda Cobiac of the University of Melbourne. A number of other Western countries have already implemented or proposed taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks in a bid to curb the obesity epidemic. The study modeled the effect of taxing saturated fat, salt, sugar, and sugar-sweetened beverages in Australia, as well as the impact from subsidizing fruits and vegetables. The most significant gains could be achieved by taxing sugar, which the study said could avert 270,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs)\u2014or years of healthy lifespan lost due to disease. \"That is a gain of 1.2 years of healthy life for every 100 Australians alive in 2010,\" said the study. \"Few other public health interventions could deliver such health gains on average across the whole population.\" The second-greatest impact was seen in a salt tax, followed by a saturated-fat tax and a sugar-sweetened beverage tax. Adding subsidies for fruits and vegetables \"reduced health sector spending, but on their own were not estimated to lead to a clear health benefit,\" said the study. 2/3 The taxes and subsidies were limited to allow for less than a one percent change in total food spending for the average household.

Contact  Is the fat tax really effective? Recently, some European countries, including Spain, have considered introducing new taxes to reduce their budget deficits. Among the set of measures, they have proposed a fat tax, which has the aims of not only increasing revenues, but also reducing junk food consumption, and thereby obesity rates and the concomitant health costs. Although this is what we expect from the theory, empirical evidence is revelatory of a different picture. Firstly, the tax is not fully reflected in the prices of the products that have been targeted. In fact, in the countries where the tax has been imposed, supermarkets and other food stores have played with prices and margins of other products in an attempt to avoid raising the prices of the products that are subject to taxation. For example, some firms have increased the prices of substitutes (e.g. sodas with low calories) while spreading the higher cost of taxed food onto other foods or own-branded products that typically have higher profit margins. Another interesting reaction from the supply side has been that producers have been substituting those taxed products with un-taxed products that are just as unhealthy. Additionally, they have also reduced the amount of some inputs below the legal threshold to avoid the fat tax. Ostensibly, these tricks have clearly diminished the effectiveness of the tax. On the demand side, we have also seen interesting reactions. Firstly, it is important to notice that people who consume more junk food are less responsive to a price increase than moderate consumers. Hence, the fat tax is not actually benefiting its most important target audience. Furthermore, there is an important substitution effect as all products have, on the whole, become more expensive, consumers have swi",

An increasing number of Western countries have implemented or proposed taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks in an attempt to curb rates of dietary-related diseases, however the cost-effectiveness of combining various taxes and subsidies is not well-understood. In the new study, researchers modeled the effect of taxes on saturated fat, salt, sugar, and sugar-sweetened beverages and a subsidy on fruits and vegetables on the Australian population of 22 million alive in 2010. They simulated how different combinations of these taxes and subsidies -- designed so there would be less than a one percent change in total food expenditure for the average household -- impacted the death and morbidity rates of Australians as well as healthcare spending over the remainder of their lives. The greatest impact, the researchers concluded, came from a sugar tax, which could avert 270,000 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs, or years of healthy lifespan across the population lost due to disease). \"That is a gain of 1.2 years of healthy life for every 100 Australians alive in 2010,\" the authors say. \"Few other public health interventions could deliver such health gains on average across the whole population.\" A salt tax was estimated to save 130,000 DALYS over the remainder of the lives of Australians alive in 2010, a saturated fat tax 97,000 DALYs, and a sugar-sweetened beverage tax 12,000 DALYs.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

The objective of this review was to study the behavioural and health outcomes of implemented food and beverage FIs in the form of taxes and subsidies in countries of different income classifications. Methods The present systematic review was conducted in accordance with Cochrane protocols. The search was carried out on academic and grey literature in English, for studies conducted in different countries on implemented FIs on food and non-alcoholic beverages and health outcomes, with a special focus on the income of those countries. Results Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria and 14 were from peer- reviewed journals. Thirteen studies came from high-income (HI) countries, four from upper middle-income (UMI) countries and only one came from a lower middle-income (LMI) country. There were no studies from lower-income (LI) countries. Of these 18 studies; nine focused on taxes, all of which were from HI countries. Evidence suggests that FIs on foods can influence consumption of taxed and subsidized foods and consequently have the potential to improve health. Conclusion Although this review supports previous findings that FIs can have an impact on healthy food consumption, it also highlights the lack of evidence available from UMI, LMI and LI countries on such interventions. Therefore, evidence from HI countries may not be directly applicable to middle-income and LI countries. Similar research conducted in middle and low income countries will be beneficial in advocating policy makers on the effectiveness of FIs in countering the growing iss",

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

While much remains unresolved, the available evidence does not favor subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables or taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) as obesity policy. Taxes on specific nutrients are generally found to be more effective in reducing calorie consumption and body weight as well as economically more efficient. However, any food tax will be regressive and could have other undesirable unintended consequences, and it is not clear that it would be politically feasible to set any such tax at a high enough rate to have a worthwhile effect on reducing obesity.

Indeed, the established theory and evidence on the economics of the \u201cfixed charge\u201d (Alchian and Allen 1964; Barzel 1976) suggests that the opposite effect is likely: imposition of a fixed per unit cost (as with a per unit tax) reduces the relative price of higher quality and tends to induce quality upgrading. SSBs are disfavored in a number of countries, meaning that they are taxed at a higher rate than general foods and beverages. Countries that have implemented such a policy include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom (Jou and Techakehakij 2012). For these countries, the VAT on SSBs ranges between 19% and 30%. Thow et al. (2011) s",

Some changes are positive [if] we eat more fruits and vegetables. Some are negative, such as higher consumption of salt,\" says co-author Sinne Smed, from the department of Environment and Natural Resources, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Smed and her colleagues studied the effects of a controversial fat tax introduced in Denmark between 2011 and 2013. Contrary to their initial concerns, the tax actually encouraged people to change their shopping habits so that they bought four per cent less saturated fat, and more vegetables and salty foods. The researchers used these data to estimate the potential health benefits of these changes. These shifts in food choices--whether they were based on the type of fat, salt or fibre content, or choosing to eat more fruit and vegetable--correlated with the number of incidences of people dying from a range of diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. \"The results show a relatively small but significant decrease in the number of deaths due to non-infectious diseases,\" says Smith. The new results are published in the Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study shows that the \u2018fat tax\u2019 regulated consumer behaviour exactly as it was meant to do. But this new consumer behaviour does not automatically mean that we are healthier, says Professor Arne Astrup from the Department of Sport and Nutrition, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, who was not involved in the research. Astrup is sceptical about the \u2018fat tax\u2019, which he thinks will only encourage people to choose other unhealthy foods. Nonetheless, these studies are important if politicians are to base policy on scientific knowledge, he says. \"The study shows that the \u2018fat tax\u2019 achieved the desired effect an",

While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Methods and Findings Using a population model of dietary-related diseases and health care costs and food price elasticities, we simulated the effect of taxes on saturated fat, salt, sugar, and sugar-sweetened beverages and a subsidy on fruits and vegetables, over the lifetime of the Australian population. The sizes of the taxes and subsidy were set such that, when combined as a package, there would be a negligible effect on average weekly expenditure on food (<1% change).

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

However, most literature focuses on their impact on consumer behaviours. This review summarizes the impact of various nutrition policies on food (re)formulation. Recent Findings Food (re)formulation targets (particularly mandatory policies) have been associated with positive reformulation of targeted products. Limited evidence (mostly from Health Star Ratings and the Tick) demonstrates that some labelling policies effectively incentivize food reformulation. No peer-reviewed evidence has examined warning labels and taxes on sugar in drinks, but limited grey literature evaluation suggests that those policies have stimulated reformulation to some extent. Conclusions The effect of nutrition policies on food (re)formulation is insufficiently studied. The impact of such policies on (re)formulation is likely greater when they are mandatory, aligned with other regulations, and thoroughly monitored and evaluated. Policies targeting (re)formulation have important limitations and broader food system policies will additionally be needed to significantly improve diets.

Taxing unhealthy foods like sugary drinks makes them relatively more expensive, potentially encouraging people to buy more healthy alternatives. Evidence shows that such taxes do reduce consumption and that firms reformulate their products, with beneficial effects on health. Taxes on sugary soft drinks have been implemented in many places. In the UK, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (commonly known as the \u2018sugar tax\u2019), which was introduced in March 2018, adds a charge of between 18p and 24p per litre on drinks depending on the quantity of sugar that they contain. These types of taxes have been effective at reducing consumption of sugary soft drinks, and at encouraging firms to reformulate and reduce the amount of sugar in the drinks they produce. According to one study, the percentage of drinks with over five grams of sugar per 100 millilitres fell from an expected level of 49% to 15% between September 2015 and February 2019. This suggests that broader taxes that increase the prices of other types of unhealthy food could be effective tools for tackling obesity, although their ultimate success will depend on how consumers and firms respond to their introduction. Why tax some foods and not others? Governments commonly use taxes to make some goods more expensive than others to discourage people from purchasing them. These are called \u2018corrective taxes\u2019 because they aim to correct the fact that the market price of a product may not fully reflect all the costs associated with consumption, including any to wider society. These include the costs of treating diseases linked to poor diet, excess alcohol consumption and smoking, which are often borne by publicly funded healthcare systems. If everyone accounted for all the effects and costs \u2013 imposed both on themselves in the future and on broader society \u2013 that were associated with their consumption, then there would be little reason for government intervention.

What is obesity?  Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being).  What are fats?  Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: - saturated (mostly from animal products, such as meat, cow's milk, cheese, cream, and butter); and - unsaturated (mostly found in oils from plants and fish). Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: - reduce the overall amount of fat they eat; - limit the amount of saturated fats they eat; and - eat unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats.  Why we did this Cochrane Review   Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity.  What did we do?  We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a tax on the fat content of foods. We were interested in how a tax affected the: - total amount of fat, and saturated fats eaten; - total calories eaten; - calories eaten from all fats and saturated fats; and - rates of overweight and obesity.

What is obesity?  Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being).  What are fats?  Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: - saturated (mostly from animal products, such as meat, cow's milk, cheese, cream, and butter); and - unsaturated (mostly found in oils from plants and fish). Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: - reduce the overall amount of fat they eat; - limit the amount of saturated fats they eat; and - eat unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats.  Why we did this Cochrane Review   Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity.  What did we do?  We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a tax on the fat content of foods. We were interested in how a tax affected the: - total amount of fat, and saturated fats eaten; - total calories eaten; - calories eaten from all fats and saturated fats; and - rates of overweight and obesity.  Search date: we included evidence published up to September 2019.  What we found  We found two studies",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

Oliver Mytton Alastair Gray Mike Rayner Harry Rutter Correspondence to: Dr O Mytton, Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham NG7 2UH, UK; olivermytton@doctors.org.uk Accepted 2006 Nov 11. Abstract Objective To examine the effects on nutrition, health and expenditure of extending value added tax (VAT) to a wider range of foods in the UK. Method A model based on consumption data and elasticity values was constructed to predict the effects of extending VAT to certain categories of food. The resulting changes in demand, expenditure, nutrition and health were estimated. Three different tax regimens were examined: (1) taxing the principal sources of dietary saturated fat; (2) taxing foods defined as unhealthy by the SSCg3d nutrient scoring system; and (3) taxing foods in order to obtain the best health outcome. Data Consumption patterns and elasticity data were taken from the National Food Survey of Great Britain. The health effects of changing salt and fat intake were from previous meta\u2010analyses. Results (1) Taxing only the principal sources of dietary saturated fat is unlikely to reduce the incidence of cardiovascular disease because the reduction in saturated fat is offset by a rise in salt consumption. (2) Taxing unhealthy foods, defined by SSCg3d score, might avert around 2300 deaths per annum, primarily by reducing salt intake. (3) Taxing a wider range of foods could avert up to 3200 cardiovascular deaths in the UK per annum (a 1.7% reduction).

However, most literature focuses on their impact on consumer behaviours. This review summarizes the impact of various nutrition policies on food (re)formulation. Recent Findings Food (re)formulation targets (particularly mandatory policies) have been associated with positive reformulation of targeted products. Limited evidence (mostly from Health Star Ratings and the Tick) demonstrates that some labelling policies effectively incentivize food reformulation. No peer-reviewed evidence has examined warning labels and taxes on sugar in drinks, but limited grey literature evaluation suggests that those policies have stimulated reformulation to some extent. Conclusions The effect of nutrition policies on food (re)formulation is insufficiently studied. The impact of such policies on (re)formulation is likely greater when they are mandatory, aligned with other regulations, and thoroughly monitored and evaluated. Policies targeting (re)formulation have important limitations and broader food system policies will additionally be needed to significantly improve diets.

What does the process really entail? And can it be done successfully during a global pandemic? As consumer demands for health, nutrition and immunity unite with sustainability goals and better-for-the-planet supply chain efforts, brands reformulate to reflect consumer priorities and the changing food and drink landscape. In February 2021\u2014ahead of the latest National Food Strategy\u2014 the UK government unveiled its research briefing, entitled Food and drink reformulation to reduce fat, sugar and salt. \u201cThere is overall consensus on the health benefits of reducing saturated fats, free sugar and salt,\u201d the research revealed. \u201cHowever, this can present some challenges for the industry, given the functional role of these ingredients,\u201d it noted. Product quality, industry engagement and consumer preferences are all considerations food and drink brands must make when entering the reformulation process. Reformulation can be a closely guarded secret, and food and drink brands can enter into the process for a number of reasons. From product launch to rethink or recall, to market research and design thinking, to reformulation and roll-out\u2014it is not a quick process to undertake and there is not a \u2018one size fits all\u2019 approach when it comes to reformulation. In fact, there are several reasons why a food and drink brand may need to go back to the drawing board to update its product. Why do brands reformulate? Why do brands reformulate?

The primary aim of this tax is to discourage the consumption of unhealthy foods, thereby promoting healthier dietary choices among consumers. Typically levied as an additional cost at the point of sale, this tax seeks to make unhealthy options less appealing economically. For instance, Denmark\u2019s fat tax, introduced in 2011, charged approximately $0.25 per kilogram of saturated fat, although it was short-lived due to public backlash and economic challenges.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve personal productivity. In the United States, obesity has a $70 billion annual cost to businesses. This comes through lost productivity and other factors that are directly attri",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0  15 January 2018 Abstract The global burden of obesity leads to significant morbidity and has major economic implications. In April 2018, Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle this using fiscal measures when the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy is introduced. We review recent evidence from natural experiments of the impact of health-related food and drink taxes on consumer behaviour, and discuss the possible consequences of these approaches on purchases and health. We highlight some of the potential indirect consequences and the importance of robust prospective evaluation. Keywords  In recent decades, the global burden of obesity and related conditions has surged. In 2014, 13\u00a0% of the world's population were obese(1), with an estimated cost to the global economy of $2 trillion(2). Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle the consequences of obesity using fiscal measures when the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) is introduced in April, 2018(3). Recent data on the impact of health-related food and drink taxes from natural experimental evaluations are allowing us to better understand how fiscal measures affect behaviour. In this review, we draw on this new evidence and discuss how health-related food and drink taxes might change purchasing habits and improve health.  Why implement food and drink taxes?

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

However, most literature focuses on their impact on consumer behaviours. This review summarizes the impact of various nutrition policies on food (re)formulation. Recent Findings Food (re)formulation targets (particularly mandatory policies) have been associated with positive reformulation of targeted products. Limited evidence (mostly from Health Star Ratings and the Tick) demonstrates that some labelling policies effectively incentivize food reformulation. No peer-reviewed evidence has examined warning labels and taxes on sugar in drinks, but limited grey literature evaluation suggests that those policies have stimulated reformulation to some extent. Conclusions The effect of nutrition policies on food (re)formulation is insufficiently studied. The impact of such policies on (re)formulation is likely greater when they are mandatory, aligned with other regulations, and thoroughly monitored and evaluated. Policies targeting (re)formulation have important limitations and broader food system policies will additionally be needed to significantly improve diets.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

He talks about the replacement of whole ingredients by extracts, such as cocoa that becomes cocoa extract, so that a cereal bar no longer contains chocolate. Skimpflation is the little brother of shrinkflation, which consists in reducing the quantity of a product in the packaging, and which constitutes a price increase. The problem with both is that manufacturers don't have to declare it. \u201cUltimately, the consumer gets less for their money \u2014 that\u2019s a given,\u201d Th\u00e9riault told the Star. We spend an average of 30 minutes in the grocery store, where there are 50,000 products, which means we see 25 per second. \"We certainly don't have time to look at or remember the ingredients.\" As a result, Th\u00e9riault advises shoppers to stick with products with a smaller list of ingredients \u2014 companies are less likely to change these recipes as alterations will be more noticeable by consumers, he said. On the flip side, less processed foods like meat, vegetables, dairy and more are usually safe from skimpflation \u2014 \u201cthe closer you get to the agricultural commodities, the less likely you are to have a product that has gone through skimpflation.\u201d Read more from The Toronto Star.

Sometimes it\u2019s your tastebuds maturing, and sometimes it\u2019s because things just seemed to taste better when you were a kid.  Hershey\u2019s Chocolate Back in the 2000s, Hershey\u2019s made a huge change to their recipe. While they tried to be subtle about it, there was one huge difference. To make production cheaper, Hershey\u2019s replaced cocoa butter with vegetable oil. As you can probably guess, cocoa butter is a key ingredient in milk chocolate.  In fact, everyone was so angry that the FDA had to assure the public, saying that cacao fat would still be a primary ingredient. Nutella The core ingredients \u2013 hazelnuts, cocoa, sugar, and palm oil \u2013 are still the same. However, a \u201cfine tuning\u201d back in 2017 left hardcore Nutella fans outraged.\u00a0 This change was made to improve the consistency and milk content. While Nutella can still go on just about anything, its lighter color still has people suspicious. The Hamburg Consumer Protection Center noted that the color change was indicative of a more extreme recipe change. Many people found the recipe change to be unforgivable. Doritos Doritos have made multiple tweaks to their formula over the years, though you probably won\u2019t catch Frito Lay, Doritos\u2019 parent company, making any statements.  Doritos are now made of larger and thinner chips with much more seasoning. People enjoy this variation nevertheless \u2013 after all, Doritos are a classic! This is because of a phenomenon called \u201cshrinkflation,\u201d which allows companies to make less of their product while maintaining the regular price.  Rice Krispies In 2018, the biggest change to the Rice Krispie treats recipe was made in South Africa. To save money, Kelloggs switched to a new multi-grain formula.

When companies try to improve on an already beloved product, consumer reaction doesn't always go as planned. Check out these surprising recipe changes that left the world wondering, \"Why?\" Now Trending New Coke Coca-Cola aficionados love the fizzy beverage because of its very familiar taste. Chances are, if you ask a brand loyal consumer to taste the difference between Coke and Pepsi, they can do it in a heartbeat. So why Coca-Cola decided to change its formula in 1985 is still a head-scratcher. According to Time, the company\u2019s new recipe was described as a sweeter version of the already sugary drink and despite winning out in blind taste tests, the product was met with great backlash. Three months later Coke \u201cClassic\u201d was back on shelves.

Iconic dishes may suddenly be reinvented to suit evolving tastes and food quality standards. Classic recipes at popular fast food restaurants are often tweaked or completely overhauled for one of two reasons. Firstly, some chain restaurants revamp their menu offerings in response to changing taste preferences, introducing flavors more in line with customer demands. Secondly, many fast food restaurants update their recipes to align with new health and wellness trends, offering items with fewer calories and reduced sodium. Whether welcomed or criticized by customers, menu shifts are inevitable, reflecting the continual effort made by chain restaurants to remain competitive. For some, these changes offer culinary novelty, for others they represent a disappointing shift away from the comfort and nostalgia of yesteryear. No matter your perspective, one thing is clear \u2014 even when it comes to fast food, progress is inevitable. Curious to find out more about the most memorable and controversial recipe changes in the world of fast food? Keep reading. French fries at McDonald's  Many fast food enthusiasts expressed their disapproval when McDonald's switched from using vegetable oil to beef tallow in its French Fry recipe. Prior to 1990, the McDonald's menu item was fried in 93% beef tallow and 7% canola oil, a blend that gave it a distinctively rich umami flavor. Derived from rendered cow suet, beef tallow is packed with nutrients and has a high smoke point, which makes it ideal for frying. Given its numerous benefits, one might wonder why the fast food giant transitioned from cooking its iconic French fries in beef tallow to using vegetable oil. The answer lies in the growing concerns about health during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Perhaps the most damaging blow for McDonald's came when Phil Sokolof, a millionaire who blamed his heart attack on the fat and cholesterol in fast food, used full-page ne",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed.

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Among the various policy options, unhealthy food and beverage taxes have gained attention as a potentially effective intervention to reduce non-nutritive caloric intake, while raising government funds for health promotion programs at the community level. Yet in many countries, including in Israel, such proposals have not gained broad support. Cities in both United States and Mexico have found that taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages reduce consumption. Yet the food industry has successfully fought many such policies. Looking forward, those supporting taxation policies will need to provide clear evidence, a compelling use of funds raised, a convincing answer to industry claims, and attention to equity in implementation. With no easy fixes in sight to obesity, it is likely that taxes will remain viable \u2013 if contested \u2013 options for the foreseeable future. With more than a quarter of global mortality now attributed to diseases related to obesity, including cardiovascular disease and stroke [1], it is no surprise that policymakers are considering a range of potential respo",

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Abstract Background Taxes on alcohol and tobacco have long been an important means of raising revenues for public spending in many countries but there is increasing interest in using taxes on these, and other unhealthy products, to achieve public health goals. We present a systematic review of the research on health taxes, and aim to generate insights into how such taxes can: (i) reduce consumption of targeted products and related harms; (ii) generate revenues for health objectives and distribute the tax burden across income groups in an efficient and equitable manner; and (iii) be made politically sustainable.

Existing evidence concerning their effects comes largely from simulation studies and trials in closed settings, both of which have limitations. Rigorous evaluation of actual taxes may provide richer evidence with greater external validity to support policy making. This article describes existing evaluation studies and outlines an implicit underlying theoretical framework for how taxes are expected to affect health. It then explores three important issues for future studies: selection of an appropriate evaluative perspective (comparing realist and biomedical experimental paradigms); approaches to causal inference; and the challenge of a low signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that evaluation should be informed by a realist perspective as well as making appropriate use of established empirical quasi-experimental approaches to testing causal effects. This should be underpinned by a theoretical framework that acknowledges complexity and the potential diversity of impacts.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Sajjad Choudhury Follow Curated Newsletters -- 4 Share In 1990, the obesity rate across much of the US was less than 15%. However, just twenty years later, 69% of all Americans were overweight, with 36% categorised as obese. How did such a drastic change happen so quickly? Broadly speaking, this was down to one reason; a lifestyle change. Poor eating habits, a lack of exercise and the increase in food tampering (like adding more sugar and calories) all contributed to rising obesity levels. Almost every country has faced this epidemic, and few have managed to truly solve it\u2014all except for one. Somewhat controversially, this country introduced a \u2018fat tax\u2019 that essentially forced every business to take a mandatory waist measurement of its employees every year. If the employee didn\u2019t make any improvements, then the business would be fined. The target was to reduce the obesity rate by 25%, but as of 2021, this country\u2019s nationwide obesity rate stands at a mere 4.3%, making the policy a resounding success. But how exactly does this \u2018fat tax\u2019 work, and could it be used successfully in countries like the US? -- -- 4 Published in Curated Newsletters Outstanding stories objectively and diligently selected by 40+ senior editors on ILLUMINATION.

Contact  Is the fat tax really effective? Recently, some European countries, including Spain, have considered introducing new taxes to reduce their budget deficits. Among the set of measures, they have proposed a fat tax, which has the aims of not only increasing revenues, but also reducing junk food consumption, and thereby obesity rates and the concomitant health costs. Although this is what we expect from the theory, empirical evidence is revelatory of a different picture. Firstly, the tax is not fully reflected in the prices of the products that have been targeted. In fact, in the countries where the tax has been imposed, supermarkets and other food stores have played with prices and margins of other products in an attempt to avoid raising the prices of the products that are subject to taxation. For example, some firms have increased the prices of substitutes (e.g. sodas with low calories) while spreading the higher cost of taxed food onto other foods or own-branded products that typically have higher profit margins. Another interesting reaction from the supply side has been that producers have been substituting those taxed products with un-taxed products that are just as unhealthy. Additionally, they have also reduced the amount of some inputs below the legal threshold to avoid the fat tax. Ostensibly, these tricks have clearly diminished the effectiveness of the tax. On the demand side, we have also seen interesting reactions. Firstly, it is important to notice that people who consume more junk food are less responsive to a price increase than moderate consumers. Hence, the fat tax is not actually benefiting its most important target audience. Furthermore, there is an important substitution effect as all products have, on the whole, become more expensive, consumers have swi",

The poll was undertaken in May 2024 and those surveyed were also asked to confirm their voting intention between Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat. 59% of those surveyed supported the view that a tax should be levied on companies producing food high in sugar and salt, with some of the resulting tax revenues to be used to fund fresh fruit and vegetables for low-income families. That percentage rose to 70% of the Labour voters surveyed compared to 54% of Conservative voters and 63% of Liberal Democrat voters. In a similar question, 53% of those surveyed supported the introduction of a tax on ultra-high processed food, again on the basis a proportion of the tax receipts were used to fund fresh fruit and vegetables for low-income families.

A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity. A fat tax aims to decrease the consumption of foods that are linked to obesity. A related idea is to tax foods that are linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.[2][3][4] In fact, eating behavior may be more responsive to price increases than to nutritional education.[5] Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.[6] However, there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals.[7] To implement a fat tax, it is necessary to specify which food and beverage products will be targeted. This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.[8] For instance, consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake, thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.[8] Current proposals frequently single out sugar-sweetened drinks as a target for taxation.[9][10] Cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental studies have found an association between obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks.[11][12] However, experimental studies have not always found an association, and the size of the effect can be very modest.[13] Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be regressive. Taxing foods that provide primarily calories, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem, since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations.

But there's one potential tool you may not have heard of, though it's been discussed for more than a decade. A June 2007 study suggests that a \"fat tax\" -- placing a tax on fatty or unhealthy foods -- might save thousands of lives and reduce health care costs. Also called the Twinkie tax, the fat tax concept was pioneered by Kelly D. Brownell, a professor of psychology at Yale University, who wrote about it in the New York Times in 1994. Dr. Brownell outlined two proposals, the first of which suggested a 7 percent to 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods. The tax revenue would then subsidize the sale of healthy foods. The tax would apply to broad types of foods or target certain fatty foods. Brownell's alternate proposal stated that a lesser tax could be used to fund public programs promoting healthy and responsible eating. Advertisement Researchers at Oxford University and Nottingham University claim that a 17.5 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on unhealthy food could save up to 3,200 lives a year. The tax would effectively save lives by reducing demands for unhealthy foods, consequently reducing occurrences of serious complications from obesity, such as heart attacks and diabetes. In determining how demand would be lowered, the researchers calculated how higher prices on unhealthy foods would affect the market for those products. The scientists created scenarios involving three different potential methods of taxation. The first model taxed only foods loaded with saturated fat. But this taxation method simply caused consumers to switch to other salty, unhealthy foods, which resulted in even more severe health consequences. It also increased food costs for the average family by 3.2 percent [Source: Guardian Unlimited]. The second taxation scheme assigned various foods a rating, ",

Its introduction into almost every mass-produced, low-cost food item in our grocery stores is one of the primary reasons for the rise in childhood and adult obesity. Eat healthier, you say?

These same corporations have made a secondary business catering to the well-to-do, who can afford to pay the premium for FDA-defined \"organic\" foods, meats and produce. You aren't making people healthier by imposing your fat tax...all you're doing is soothing your Politically Correct sensibilities by claiming it's a choice, while continuing to line the pockets of government and big business. If you truly cared about people's state of health and the cost to society, you'd lay the penalty where it belongs...with big business who make these products because they're cheaper, and with government who regulates food content and subsidizes the crops and practices that produce them.

If you look at the definition of opportunity cost, you will see that we choose something because it is more attractive than the next best choice. The next best choice to fatty foods is something close to fatty foods. Government can't legislate these kinds of decisi",

The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: A Policy Failure Liam Sigaud* Since 2014, eight U.S. cities have implemented sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes. Several other cities and states are contemplating similar measures. SSB taxes are intended to curb sugar consumption and improve public health, but policymakers too often ignore the unintended consequences these measures provoke. This ConsumerGram examines the effects of SSB taxes, including their disproportionate impact on poor households, their failure to meaningfully shift consumers behaviors, and their negative economic effects on local communities. Introduction The debate that Americans, as a whole, consume too much sugar has received much attention recently.1 Research shows that diets high in added sugar contribute to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other chronic conditions.2 To address these public health concerns, some policymakers have embraced targeted \u201csin\u201d taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). In 2014, Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction in the nation to pass an SSB tax.

Upon the examination of the available evidence as to the effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing obesity authors conclude that all types of fat taxes are not sufficiently specific in targeting obesity. In some cases imposition of fat tax may actually lead to reversal of the intended effect. Therefore, the use of taxes to reduce obesity and promote healthy outcomes is not recommended.

Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

Abstract In 2011, Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat, but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses, casting doubt on evidence, diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented, the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However, other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals, politicians and the public. In the end, the fat tax wa",

They are not approaches that on their own are likely to bring about change. Policy evidence from existing food tax implementation suggest that taxes need to be paralleled by subsidies and other interventions to encourage healthy eating. Such dual methods help not only contribute to nutrition outcomes but also ensure political support for food taxes. Politicians and policy makers are suspicious of taxes, using subsidies and revenue monies from taxes to support healthy eating is more likely to encourage both political and public support. Building support for policies is never just a matter of academic evidence. Public health advocates need to show more ambition by developing skills in implementing pricing policies to support healthy eating. Key opponents to taxes are the food industry who use a range of arguments to prevent taxation being implemented.

Supporters of these policies view them as imperative for achieving public health aims while some opponents view them as overly paternalistic, infringing on consumer choice and potentially inequitable. As a consequence, their ethical status and permissibility are both contested and of importance in decision-making for policy. Traditional ethical analysis of these interventions has examined the ethical implications of the policies according to a direct, linear view of the relationships between government and consumer and the impact of government policy on the consumer. However, this approach to ethical analysis fails to take into account the role of the food industry as the subjects of the policies and intermediaries between government and consumers in the implementation and effectiveness of the policies. The actions of the food industry in response to a policy substantially determine how the policy translates to changes in the food supply and thus, the effect of the policy on consumers. This has significant implications for the ethical status of the policy. As a result, this article calls for complicating the common ethical approach to restrictive food policies by adopting a framing that recognizes the role of the food industry in the implementation of these policies. We then discuss three implications this framing has for ethical analysis: first that ethical analysis must be more nuanced and recognize the potentially complex outcomes of a policy, second that it must be dynamic and ongoing and third that underlying assumptions about policies\u2019 effects on choice, ef",

The typical motivation for these fat taxes is the public health perspective, the idea that it is socially valuable to make health outcomes better regardless of how individuals might trade off risky dietary behaviors with those outcomes. This paper assesses possible alternative rationales for such a tax, examining arguments based on behavioral and cognitive failure as well as traditional economic arguments. \r The strongest role for a broad, health-based tax on foods would be as a health-insurance system component. Ideally, the tax amount would approximate the expected medical cost from consuming each unit of food, and the tax revenues would cover claims for the associated disease conditions as they arose. This tax/claim system would serve four major insurance-based purposes. First, it would reduce moral hazard by causing individuals to make ex ante payments covering the expected covered costs of risky eating behavior. Second, it would tend to alleviate adverse selection problems by providing implicit risk adjustment for the associated maladies. Third, it would address the incomplete markets problem that consumers are restricted to short-term coverage by introducing a long-term component into the system. Finally, it would aid in separating inherent risk over which individuals have no control from risk that is a function of behavior. Serving these purposes would be especially valuable in developed country systems where coverage is universal or a certain minimum treatment package is available regardless of ability to pay. \r Whether a fat tax served to further insurance system objectives, general public health goals or other purposes, there are substantial implementatio",

However, it is also increasingly linked with social and economic development and policies regarding agriculture, transportation, urban planning, the environment, food processing, distribution, marketing, and education. Obesity-related healthcare spending is estimated to cost up to $190 billion per year, or more than 20% of total US healthcare costs (Carroll, The price of America\u2019s obesity epidemic: obesity\u2019s financial toll threatens the future of American individuals and businesses. The Motley Fool. Available from: https://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/03/09/the-price-of-americas-obesity-epidemic.aspx, 9 March 2013). If nothing is done to stop the epidemic now, it will rise by an additional $50 billion or more by 2030 (Carroll, The price of America\u2019s obesity epidemic: obesity\u2019s financial toll threatens the future of American individuals and businesses.

Therefore, the inclusion of food policy interventions at the national and international level may be an effective approach to make healthy food affordable and accessible to all.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

However, the implementation of a fat tax raises significant ethical and social considerations that warrant careful examination.  <h2 style=\"font-weight: bold; margin: 12px 0;\">Ethical Implications of a Fat Tax</h2> A fat tax raises ethical concerns about government intervention in individual choices and the potential for disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. Critics argue that it infringes on individual liberty by dictating dietary choices and potentially exacerbating existing inequalities. The argument is that individuals should be free to make their own choices, even if those choices are deemed unhealthy. Moreover, a fat tax could disproportionately affect low-income households, who often rely on cheaper, less healthy food options. This could exacerbate existing health disparities and create a cycle of poverty and poor health.  <h2 style=\"font-weight: bold; margin: 12px 0;\">Social Impact of a Fat Tax</h2> The social impact of a fat tax is multifaceted and complex. While proponents argue that it could lead to a reduction in obesity rates and associated health problems, critics point to potential unintended consequences. For instance, a fat tax could lead to increased food prices, making healthy food options even less accessible to low-income households. Additionally, it could create a black market for unhealthy foods, undermining efforts to promote healthy eating habits. Furthermore, the implementation of a fat tax could lead to social stigma and discrimination against individuals who consume unhealthy foods, potentially exacerbating existing social inequalities.  <h2 style=\"font-we",

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options.

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets.      Subjects/methods:      Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.      Results:      The subsidy brings mean levels of fruit and vegetable consumption in line with dietary recommendations, but the tax is insufficient to achieve this goal for fat intakes.

Three specific types of taxes are studied in the literature: food group taxes; nutrient taxes; and nutrient index taxes. Anumber of studies use food expenditure data to assess the impact of various taxes on obesity and therefore only indirectly measure the impacts of taxes and subsidies on obesity. These studies generally conclude that food group taxes, nutrient taxes and nutrient index taxes have a small impact on the purchases of food and the nutrients purchased. Other studies use the body mass index as the explanatory variable and thus measure the impacts of taxes on body mass index directly. Nutrient taxes are found to be more effective than food group taxes, although even for nutrient taxes, the effects are small. In general, thin subsidies seem to offer more effective control of obesity than obesity taxes. However, due to the small effects of both fat taxes and thin subsidies, they are not recommended as instruments of food and nutrition policy.    PubMed Disclaimer",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat.

In the absence of safe, effective and widely accessible high-risk approaches (e.g. drugs and surgery) attention has focussed on community-based approaches and social marketing campaigns as the most appropriate form of intervention. However there is limited evidence in support of substantial effectiveness of such interventions. Discussion To date there is little evidence that community-based interventions and social marketing campaigns specifically targeting obesity provide substantial or lasting benefit. Concerns have been raised about potential negative effects created by a focus of these interventions on body shape and size, and of the associated media targeting of obesity. Summary A more appropriate strategy would be to enact high-level policy and legislative changes to alter the obesogenic environments in which we live by providing incentives for healthy eating and increased levels of physical activity. Research is also needed to improve treatments available for individuals already obese.   Peer Review reports  Background The increasing prevalence of obesity is now the target of public health effort in most developed countries [1]. The cause of this increasing prevalence of obesity is attributed to societal changes leading to reduced physical activity and increased consumption of energy-dense foods [2, 3]. Obesity-reduction strategies in the form of community-based interventions and social marketing campaigns have been established often emphasising the desirability of an ideal body weight. The strategy for achieving this is by eating less, eating healthier foods, and exercising more [4\u20136] but the primary focus is the maintenance of healthy body weight and shape [7\u201312].

Abstract National Nutritional Monitoring Bureau survey (2017) has found that more than half of the adults in India were overweight and obese. To halt this rising epidemic, development of various policy measures has been suggested in National action plan for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. One such measure is the introduction of fat tax which is a surcharge or tax placed on food and beverages containing high amounts of fat. Government of India has made various direct budgetary initiatives for boosting the sectors related to the production of items rich in fat, sugars and salt without realizing the potential public health consequences. Hence, increasing the taxes for unhealthy junk foods should encourage the people to take healthier food options which in turn lead to positive impact on health. However, fat taxationfaced several challenges during implementation in countries like Denmark, Hungary, France and United States. Major challenges were the taxation debate, setting tax limi",

Lusk and Christiane Schroeter Abstract: Previous analyses of fat taxes have generally worked within an empirical framework in which it is difficult to determine whether consumer welfare increases from the policy. This note outlines a simple means to determine whether consumers benefit from a fat tax by comparing the ratio of expenditures on the taxed good to the weight effect of the tax against the individual\u2019s willingness-to-pay to for a one-pound weight reduction. Our empirical calculations suggest that consumers would be have to be willing to pay $6,000 to $7,500 to reduce weight by one pound for a soda tax to be welfare enhancing. The results either suggest that a soda tax is very unlikely to increase consumer welfare or that the policy must be justified on some other grounds that abandon standard rationality assumptions. 2 Introduction Given the rapid rise in obesity, academics and policy makers have proposed a variety of options to improve public health. One of the most studied mechanisms is the fat tax, which uses the state\u2019s taxing power to alter relative prices in an attempt to encourage healthier eating. Economists have been at the forefront of determining the effects of fat taxes, in large part because of the need to estimate demand elasticities to project consumption and weight changes. Examples of studies that have used demand estimates to simulate weight or health effects of fat taxes include Allais, Bertail, and Nich\u00e8le (2009), Cutler, Glaeser, and Shapiro (2003), Cash, Sunding, and Zilberman (2005), Kuchler, Tegene, and Harris, (2005), and Chouinard et al. (2007), among others (see Cash and Lacanilao, 2007 or Etil\u00e9, 2011 for reviews). Although such studies have provided important insights into the potential effects of fat taxes, there is a fundamental inconsistency inherent in the studies. In particular, these studies typically estimate price elasticities, in which estimated demand curves are assumed to arise from constrained utility maximizat",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

The present paper reviews existing applications of fiscal instruments in nutrition policy and derives some perspectives and recommendations from the experiences gained with these instruments. Many countries in different parts of the world have experiences with the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, in some cases in combination with taxes on unhealthy food commodities such as confectionery or high-fat foods. These tax schemes have many similarities, but also differ in their definitions of tax objects and in the applied tax rates. Denmark has been the only country in the world to operate a tax on saturated fat content in foods, from 2011 to 2012. Most of the existing food tax schemes have been introduced from fiscal motivations, with health promotion as a secondary objective, but a few have been introduced with health promotion as the primary objective. The diversity in experiences from existing tax schemes can provide valuable insights for future use of fiscal instruments to promote healthy nutrition, in terms of designing effective and efficient tax or subsidy instruments, and in terms of smooth and politically viable implementation of the instruments. Keywords  Taxation of unhealthy commodities, such as tobacco, alcohol or sugar, is not new, but traditionally these taxes have been used for purely fiscal reasons, i.e. to generate tax revenues in order to finance public spending. Often, such taxes have been levied on non-essential \u2018luxury\u2019 goods, in order to minimise potentially harmful societal effects of the taxes. For example, the US President Woodrow Wilson ",

View all partners It\u2019s easy to assume that public health measures, such as taxing unhealthy foods, are most successful when they are based on the best available evidence. However, research suggests that evidence-based policy-making doesn\u2019t always dictate public response. Researchers have also noted tensions between different types of evidence when establishing the legitimacy of a policy. We study taxes placed on foods that are deemed unhealthy, and find scientific evidence has not dominated the debates over the legitimacy of these measures. Instead, a food tax\u2019s chances of survival are based on the ability of political interests to create a successful narrative surrounding the policy\u2019s purpose.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

In the absence of safe, effective and widely accessible high-risk approaches (e.g. drugs and surgery) attention has focussed on community-based approaches and social marketing campaigns as the most appropriate form of intervention. However there is limited evidence in support of substantial effectiveness of such interventions. Discussion To date there is little evidence that community-based interventions and social marketing campaigns specifically targeting obesity provide substantial or lasting benefit. Concerns have been raised about potential negative effects created by a focus of these interventions on body shape and size, and of the associated media targeting of obesity. Summary A more appropriate strategy would be to enact high-level policy and legislative changes to alter the obesogenic environments in which we live by providing incentives for healthy eating and increased levels of physical activity. Research is also needed to improve treatments available for individuals already obese. Peer Review reports Background The increasing prevalence of obesity is now the target of public health effort in most developed countries [1]. The cause of this increasing prevalence of obesity is attributed to societal changes leading to reduced physical activity and increased consumption of energy-dense foods [2, 3]. Obesity-reduction strategies in the form of community-based interventions and social marketing campaigns have been established often emphasising the desirability of an ideal body weight. The strategy for achieving this is by eating less, eating healthier foods, and exercising more [4\u20136] but the primary focus is the maintenance of healthy body weight and shape [7\u201312].

View all partners Anti-obesity messages are everywhere \u2013 in news, in entertainment, and in public health campaigns. We are constantly being told that fat is bad for us, and that in order to be healthy we need to lose weight. But these messages don\u2019t necessarily improve our health, and they certainly don\u2019t seem to result in weight loss. Instead, popular ideas about fatness and health often reinforce social inequalities across class, race, gender, and ability. Fat is understood as fundamentally unhealthy. Fat bodies are thought of as \u201cdiseased\u201d, and as the result of \u201cunhealthy\u201d habits. There\u2019s plenty of research that challenges these ideas. But the point of this article is not to engage in the frankly tiresome debates about whether fat people can be healthy (they can). Nor do I want to argue about whether being fat is correlated with an increased risk of certain health issues (it is, but as anyone with a high-school level understanding of statistics can tell you, correlation does not equal causation, and risk is no guarantee of outcome \u2013 otherwise we\u2019d all be at the casino getting rich). Instead, I am interested in what these anti-obesity public health messages do, and who they do it to. This is important since obesity is much more prevalent amongst disadvantaged, vulnerable, and stigmatised groups, especially those of low socioeconomic status, non-English speaking backgrounds, and Indigenous people. Public health is generally seen as a force for good. Ideally, public health messages are a way for the government to educate the general population about pote",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

Ideally, this should be combined with subsidies on healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables, they add. Their views come ahead of the 65th World Health Assembly taking place in Geneva on 21-26 May 2012 where prevention and control of non-communicable diseases will be a key issue for discussion. As an increasing number of countries introduce taxes on unhealthy food and drinks, Oliver Mytton and colleagues at the University of Oxford examine the evidence on the health effects of food taxes. Evidence suggests that taxing a wide range of unhealthy foods or nutrients is likely to result in greater health benefits than narrow taxes, they say, although the strongest evidence base is for tax on sugary drinks. For example, a US study found a 35% tax on sugar sweetened drinks ($0.45 (\u00a30.28; \u20ac0.34) per drink) in a canteen led to a 26% decline in sales.  Meanwhile modelling studies predict a 20% tax on sugary drinks in the US would reduce obesity levels by 3.5%, and suggest that extending VAT (at 17.5%) to unhealthy foods in the UK could cut up to 2700 heart disease deaths a year. Opinion polls from the US also put support for tax on sugary drinks at between 37% and 72%, particularly when the health benefits of the tax are emphasised. However, they point out that understanding the overall effect on health is complicated, and that policy makers need to be wary of negative effects, like changes in other important nutrients and compensatory behaviour that may increase energy intake or reduce energy expenditure. The food industry also argues that the taxes would be ineffective, unfair, and damage the industry leading to job losses. And from a legislative point of view, it is still unclear how ",

And not a moment too soon. Just a few days later the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced that in 2000 (the latest year for which final figures are available) the death rate in America, adjusted for the fact that the population is aging, reached an all-time low. Not only that, but life expectancy reached an all-time high, of about seventy-seven years. Obviously, those numbers can mean only one thing: America is in the grip of a gigantic public-health crisis. To wit\u2014an obesity epidemic! That America is marching fatward seems not to be in doubt. Obesity has risen substantially in recent years, to 31 percent of adults, according to the most recent data from the National Center for Health Statistics. Soft-drink cups are bigger, restaurant portions are larger, and health campaigns condemning fatty foods have persuaded people, wrongly, that they can eat twice as much bread as before, provided that they cut down on the butter. Also not in doubt is that other things being equal, being blubbery is not good. Still, one cannot help scratching one's head. If Americans are living longer, and if they are dying less (so to speak), and if, as the CDC reports, the proportion rating their own health as excellent or very good has remained at a solid 69 percent for the past five years, what exactly is the problem? Call me oversensitive, but I think I detect a hint of snobbery in the national anti-fat drive. More than occasionally I read things like a recent article from the online Bully Magazine, which was headlined \"AMERICA: LAND OF THE FAT, DRUNKEN SLOBS.\" The author, one Ken Wohlrob, writes, \"We're quickly becoming a society of sloths who spend their free hours driving around in SUVs and staring at televisions or computer monitors ...

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

Login Alert Article contents State-of-the-art for food taxes to promote public health   Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0  23 November 2017 Abstract The use of taxes to promote healthy nutritional behaviour has gained ground in the past decade. The present paper reviews existing applications of fiscal instruments in nutrition policy and derives some perspectives and recommendations from the experiences gained with these instruments. Many countries in different parts of the world have experiences with the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, in some cases in combination with taxes on unhealthy food commodities such as confectionery or high-fat foods. These tax schemes have many similarities, but also differ in their definitions of tax objects and in the applied tax rates. Denmark has been the only country in the world to operate a tax on saturated fat content in foods, from 2011 to 2012. Most of the existing food tax schemes have been introduced from fiscal motivations, with health promotion as a secondary objective, but a few have been introduced with health promotion as the primary objective. The diversity in experiences from existing tax schemes can provide valuable insights for future use of fiscal instruments to promote healthy nutrition, in terms of designing effective and efficient tax or subsidy instruments, and in terms of smooth and politically viable implementation of the instruments. Keywords  Taxation of unhealthy commodities, such as tobacco, alcohol or sugar, is not new, but traditionally these taxes have been used for purely fiscal reasons, i.e. to generate tax revenues in order to finance public spending. Often, such taxes have been levied on non-essential \u2018luxury\u2019 goods, in order to minimise potentially harmful societal effects of the taxes. For example, the US President Woodrow Wilson ",

While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5888/pcd14.170213. PEER REVIEWED  Abstract Introduction Food pricing policies to promote healthy diets, such as taxes, price manipulations, and food subsidies, have been tested in different settings. However, little consensus exists about the effect of these policies on the availability of healthy and unhealthy foods, on what foods consumers buy, or on the impact of food purchases on consumer health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of studies of the effect of food-pricing interventions on retail sales and on consumer purchasing and consumption of healthy foods and beverages. Methods We used MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library to conduct a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles related to studies of food pricing policies. We selected articles that were published in English from January 2000 through December 2016 on the following types of studies: 1) real-world experimental studies (randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments); 2) population studies of people or retail stores in middle-income and high-income countries; 3) pricing interventions alone or in combination with other strategies (price promotions, coupons, taxes, or cash-back rebates), excluding studies of vending-machine or online sales; and 4) out",

The present paper reviews existing applications of fiscal instruments in nutrition policy and derives some perspectives and recommendations from the experiences gained with these instruments. Many countries in different parts of the world have experiences with the taxation of sugar-sweetened beverages, in some cases in combination with taxes on unhealthy food commodities such as confectionery or high-fat foods. These tax schemes have many similarities, but also differ in their definitions of tax objects and in the applied tax rates. Denmark has been the only country in the world to operate a tax on saturated fat content in foods, from 2011 to 2012. Most of the existing food tax schemes have been introduced from fiscal motivations, with health promotion as a secondary objective, but a few have been introduced with health promotion as the primary objective. The diversity in experiences from existing tax schemes can provide valuable insights for future use of fiscal instruments to promote healthy nutrition, in terms of designing effective and efficient tax or subsidy instruments, and in terms of smooth and politically viable implementation of the instruments. Keywords  Taxation of unhealthy commodities, such as tobacco, alcohol or sugar, is not new, but traditionally these taxes have been used for purely fiscal reasons, i.e. to generate tax revenues in order to finance public spending. Often, such taxes have been levied on non-essential \u2018luxury\u2019 goods, in order to minimise potentially harmful societal effects of the taxes. For example, the US President Woodrow Wilson ",

This includes fiscal policies that discourage consuming foods that contribute to unhealthy diets and encourage consuming healthier foods through subsidies and other support.\u00a0 The current food environment in which many people live, work, and spend their daily lives consists of highly processed and readily available foods high in unhealthy fats, sugars, and sodium. Many of these foods are also heavily marketed and relatively cheap. As a result, consumers are often challenged to make healthy food-related decisions. Unhealthy diets are now a leading global public health risk, contributing to noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancers. This guideline reflects growing evidence which suggests that taxes on unhealthy foods like sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) can lead to lower demand and consumption. Inversely, subsidies for foods that contribute to a healthy diet, such as fruits and vegetables, make these foods more accessible and affordable. This in turn encourages their consumption, leading to increased sales and positive shifts in consumer behaviour. Implementing fiscal policies based on these insights is a promising approach to nudge consumers towards better food choices, making the healthier choice the easier choice. \u201cFiscal policies, including taxes and subsidies, have the potential to influence consumer and market behaviour through their impact on prices and affordability of products. Subsidies can encourage consumption of healthy products, while taxes can discourage consumption of health-harming products and encourage industry to reformulate its products\u201d, says Dr Ruediger Krech,\u00a0Director of the Department of Health Promotion, at the World Health Organization.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity. What did we do?

We were interested in how a tax affected the: Search date: We included evidence published up to September 2019. What we found We found two studies from Denmark, conducted during 2011 to 2012.

However, research suggests that evidence-based policy-making 1/6 doesn't always dictate public response. Researchers have also noted tensions between different types of evidence when establishing the legitimacy of a policy. We study taxes placed on foods that are deemed unhealthy, and find scientific evidence has not dominated the debates over the legitimacy of these measures. Instead, a food tax's chances of survival are based on the ability of political interests to create a successful narrative surrounding the policy's purpose. We compare Denmark, which implemented and quickly repealed a tax on saturated fats in 2011\u201312, and Ireland, which implemented a sugar-sweetened beverage tax in 2018 that has remained in place. A tale of two taxes Our findings demonstrate how certain public health measures are made acceptable to the public. They tell us about the importance of narratives in the successful implementation of similar food taxes in Canada. They also raise questions about when similar narratives may be relevant to other types of public health measures. What shaped public discussion and controversy over food taxes in Denmark and Ireland? In both these countries, the success or failure of the tax depends on two factors. First, how sympathetic were potential \"winners and losers\" under the tax? Second, did previous policies provide a template for the public to understand and potentially accept the tax? A short-lived fat tax in Denmark Denmark's \"fat tax\" has been described as a failure due to its quick 2/6 repeal. The 2.3 percent tax on foods high in saturated fats was adopted with the goal of addressing Denmark's obesity rates and lifestyle-related illnesses. However, it faced backlash after its introdu",

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

They are not approaches that on their own are likely to bring about change. Policy evidence from existing food tax implementation suggest that taxes need to be paralleled by subsidies and other interventions to encourage healthy eating. Such dual methods help not only contribute to nutrition outcomes but also ensure political support for food taxes. Politicians and policy makers are suspicious of taxes, using subsidies and revenue monies from taxes to support healthy eating is more likely to encourage both political and public support. Building support for policies is never just a matter of academic evidence. Public health advocates need to show more ambition by developing skills in implementing pricing policies to support healthy eating. Key opponents to taxes are the food industry who use a range of arguments to prevent taxation being implemented. Public health advocates are weak in tackling the issues of corporate power and providing evidence to maintain policy and poli",

Design: The study draws on examples of food taxes from the developed world imposed at national and local levels. Studies were identi\ufb01ed from a systemised search in six databases with criteria designed to identity articles of policy relevance. Results: The dominant approach identi\ufb01ed from the literature was the imposition of food taxes on food to raise general revenue, such as Value Added Tax in the European Union. Food taxes can be applied in various ways, ranging from attempts to directly in\ufb02uence behaviour to those which collect taxes for identi\ufb01ed campaigns on healthy eating through to those applied within closed settings such as schools. There is a case for combining taxes of unhealthy foods with subsidies of healthy foods. The evidence from the literature concerning the use and impact of food taxes on food behaviour is not clear and those cases identi\ufb01ed are mainly retrospective descriptions of the process. Many food taxes have been withdrawn after short periods of time due to industry lobbying. Conclusions for policy: Small taxes with the clear purpose of promoting the health of key groups, e.g. children, are more likely to receive public support. The focus of many tax initiatives is unclear; although they are generally aimed at consumers, another focus could be food manufacturers, using taxes and subsidies to encourage the production of healthier foods, which could have an effect at a population level. Further consideration needs to be given to this ",

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

All errors remain the responsibility of the au-thors. 1 1 Introduction Policymakers and nutrition researchers have expressed concern that individuals eat too much saturated fat.1 For example, a press release by the Food Standards Authority states that, \"The UK is currently eating 20% more saturated fat than UK Government recommendations.\" (FSA, 12 Feb 2009) Consumption of fat and in particular saturated fat is associated with heart disease and other negative health outcomes.2 Numerous policies aimed at reducing saturated fat consumption have been suggested or tried. These include tax policies that aim to change the relative price of saturated fats. The impact of these policies on diet, and thus on health outcomes, will depend crucially on how consumers adapt their food purchasing behaviour in response to the policy, and on how \u2026rms in turn respond in terms of the prices they set and the foods they o\u00a4er. In this paper we are interested in evaluating how a tax on saturated fat would a\u00a4ect consumption patterns and who would bear the burden of the tax. Our contribution is to provide empirical estimates of the impact of a fat tax that take account of consumer substitution patterns in di\u00a4erentiated product markets where there is observed and unobserved heterogeneity in consum",

We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

PEER REVIEWED  Abstract Introduction Food pricing policies to promote healthy diets, such as taxes, price manipulations, and food subsidies, have been tested in different settings. However, little consensus exists about the effect of these policies on the availability of healthy and unhealthy foods, on what foods consumers buy, or on the impact of food purchases on consumer health outcomes. We conducted a systematic review of studies of the effect of food-pricing interventions on retail sales and on consumer purchasing and consumption of healthy foods and beverages. Methods We used MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the Cochrane Library to conduct a systematic search for peer-reviewed articles related to studies of food pricing policies. We selected articles that were published in English from January 2000 through December 2016 on the following types of studies: 1) real-world experimental studies (randomized controlled trials, quasi-experimental studies, and natural experiments); 2) population studies of people or retail stores in middle-income and high-income countries; 3) pricing interventions alone or in combination with other strategies (price promotions, coupons, taxes, or cash-back rebates), excluding studies of vending-machine or online sales; and 4) out",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue. See also: How to Stay Sane When the World is Crumbling Around You The Benefits of a Fat Tax Despite the controversies surrounding fat taxes, proponents argue they offer several potential benefits.

The 2017\u20132018 packaged food purchase data among U.S. households were used to derive household income- and composition-specific demand elasticities across 22 food and beverage categories. Policy simulations, conducted in 2022\u20132023, assessed the impact of national taxes on unhealthy ultraprocessed food and beverage purchases, both separately and alongside subsidies for minimally processed foods and beverages targeted to low-income households. Resultant nutritional implications are reported on the basis of changes in purchased calories and nutrients of concern. In addition, financial implications for both households and the federal government are projected. A sugar-based tax on sugar-sweetened beverages would lower both volume and calories purchased with the largest impact on low-income households without children. Meanwhile, targeted subsidies would increase fruit, vegetable, and healthier drink purchases without substantially increasing calories. Under tax simulations, low-income households would make larger reductions in their absolute volume and calorie purchases of taxed foods and beverages than their higher-income counterparts, suggesting that these policies, if implemented, could help narrow nutritional disparities. Levying national taxes on unhealthy ultraprocessed foods/beverages and offering targeted subsidies for minimally processed foods/beverages could promote healthier food choices among low-income households.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

Taxes on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) reduce the sale, purchase and consumption of those foods, according to a new peer-reviewed analysis of evidence from around the world from Imperial College Business School. This can lead to lower rates of obesity and other diet-related health problems, especially when taxes are combined with subsidies for healthier foods. The review also notes that higher rates of tax are more likely to reduce HFSS food consumption and obesity, and the response is most pronounced among lower-income groups. Global findings The review explores findings from 20 studies worldwide, in countries including Mexico, the United States, Canada, Hungary, Denmark, the Netherlands, Singapore and New Zealand, highlighting the global potential of taxes on HFSS foods. To date, only 16 countries have implemented taxes on HFSS foods, and the review incorporates some of these, alongside experimental studies. In Mexico, an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, including sweets, chocolates, sugary cereals, crisps, and salty snacks, saw a reduction in the sale of taxed foods of 18% in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers. Low-income groups, who were greater consumers of the taxed foods beforehand, showed the biggest drop in consumption once the tax was implemented. Findings from North America and New Zealand also suggest that a low-rate tax or a tax without subsidies for healthier foods introduced in parallel, might only be effective in raising government revenues.

They found that this combined policy scenario would likely lead low-income households to improve the nutritional quality of their grocery purchases without increasing their overall costs or negatively impacting consumer satisfaction. Targeted taxes are a proven, cost-effective means to reduce purchase and intake of sugary drinks, which could potentially save millions of years of life globally by reducing chronic diseases caused by excess sugar and calories. While over 60 countries and smaller jurisdictions worldwide have implemented health-focused sugary drink taxes, relatively few have earmarked the revenue raised to subsidize healthy food purchases. In the United States, studies evaluating programs that provide additional cash benefits for food assistance participants to spend on fruits and vegetables consistently find that they increase consumers\u2019 purchase and intake of targeted products.

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

While much remains unresolved, the available evidence does not favor subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables or taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) as obesity policy. Taxes on specific nutrients are generally found to be more effective in reducing calorie consumption and body weight as well as economically more efficient. However, any food tax will be regressive and could have other undesirable unintended consequences, and it is not clear that it would be politically feasible to set any such tax at a high enough rate to have a worthwhile effect on reducing obesity.

Indeed, the established theory and evidence on the economics of the \u201cfixed charge\u201d (Alchian and Allen 1964; Barzel 1976) suggests that the opposite effect is likely: imposition of a fixed per unit cost (as with a per unit tax) reduces the relative price of higher quality and tends to induce quality upgrading. SSBs are disfavored in a number of countries, meaning that they are taxed at a higher rate than general foods and beverages. Countries that have implemented such a policy include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom (Jou and Techakehakij 2012). For these countries, the VAT on SSBs ranges between 19% and 30%. Thow et al. (2011) s",

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics. The Rationale Behind Sugar, Salt, and Fat Taxes The primary goal of taxing sugar, salt, and fat is to improve public health by discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. The logic is straightforward: by increasing the cost of these items, consumers will be less likely to purchase them, leading to a decrease in intake and, consequently, a reduction in the incidence of diet-related diseases. Case Studies: The Global Landscape of Food Taxes Different countries have adopted various approaches to taxing unhealthy food components, with mixed results. Here are a few notable examples: Impact on Consumer Behavior One of the critical questions surrounding these taxes is whether they effectively change consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to reduced consumption of unhealthy products. However, the extent of this change varies depending on several factors: Health Outcomes: Do Food Taxes Lead to Better Health? While changing consumer behavior is one thing, the ultimate goal of these taxes is to improve public health. Research indicates that taxes on sugar, salt, and fat can lead to modest reductions in the incidence of obesity and related diseases. However, the impact on public hea",

Agueably however intakes that are of real concern are those which are some distance away from the recommendations. Fiscal measures might have a limited impact on such diets, and as a result, on health. We measure the impact of a fiscal intervention on the the risks of diet-related disease, accounting for the full range of diets. Subjects/Methods: Demand equations are estimated with data collected from 6760 households in the UK Expenditure and Food Survey. The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk. In contrast with other studies, we simulate the impacts of the fiscal regime at the level of the individual households in the sample.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

A levy on fatty foods can change peoples\u2019 eating habits in a short space of time, shows new research. \u201cMany foods are replaced when politicians regulate our consumption. Some changes are positive [if] we eat more fruits and vegetables. Some are negative, such as higher consumption of salt,\" says co-author Sinne Smed, from the department of Environment and Natural Resources, University of Copenhagen, Denmark. Smed and her colleagues studied the effects of a controversial fat tax introduced in Denmark between 2011 and 2013. Contrary to their initial concerns, the tax actually encouraged people to change their shopping habits so that they bought four per cent less saturated fat, and more vegetables and salty foods. The researchers used these data to estimate the potential health benefits of these changes. These shifts in food choices--whether they were based on the type of fat, salt or fibre content, or choosing to eat more fruit and vegetable--correlated with the number of incidences of people dying from a range of diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. \"The results show a relatively small but significant decrease in the number of deaths due to non-infectious diseases,\" says Smith. The new results are published in the Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study shows that the \u2018fat tax\u2019 regulated consumer behaviour exactly as it was meant to do. But this new consumer behaviour does not automatically mean that we are healthier, says Professor Arne Astrup from the Department of Sport and Nutrition, University of Copenhagen, Denmark, who was not involved in the research. Astrup is sceptical about the \u2018fat tax\u2019, which he thinks will only encourage people to choose other unhealthy foods. Nonetheless, these studies are important if politicians are to base policy on scientific knowledge, he says. \"The study shows that the \u2018fat tax\u2019 achieved the desired effect an",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity. What did we do?

We were interested in how a tax affected the: Search date: We included evidence published up to September 2019. What we found We found two studies from Denmark, conducted during 2011 to 2012.

Taxes on foods that are high in fat, salt or sugar (HFSS) reduce the sale, purchase and consumption of those foods, according to a new peer-reviewed analysis of evidence from around the world from Imperial College Business School. This can lead to lower rates of obesity and other diet-related health problems, especially when taxes are combined with subsidies for healthier foods. The review also notes that higher rates of tax are more likely to reduce HFSS food consumption and obesity, and the response is most pronounced among lower-income groups. Global findings The review explores findings from 20 studies worldwide, in countries including Mexico, the United States, Canada, Hungary, Denmark, the Netherlands, Singapore and New Zealand, highlighting the global potential of taxes on HFSS foods. To date, only 16 countries have implemented taxes on HFSS foods, and the review incorporates some of these, alongside experimental studies. In Mexico, an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, including sweets, chocolates, sugary cereals, crisps, and salty snacks, saw a reduction in the sale of taxed foods of 18% in supermarkets and up to 40% in other retailers. Low-income groups, who were greater consumers of the taxed foods beforehand, showed the biggest drop in consumption once the tax was implemented. Findings from North America and New Zealand also suggest that a low-rate tax or a tax without subsidies for healthier foods introduced in parallel, might only be effective in raising government revenues. To really impact consumption levels and obesity, the authors found that high tax rates and s",

We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

View all partners It\u2019s easy to assume that public health measures, such as taxing unhealthy foods, are most successful when they are based on the best available evidence. However, research suggests that evidence-based policy-making doesn\u2019t always dictate public response. Researchers have also noted tensions between different types of evidence when establishing the legitimacy of a policy. We study taxes placed on foods that are deemed unhealthy, and find scientific evidence has not dominated the debates over the legitimacy of these measures. Instead, a food tax\u2019s chances of survival are based on the ability of political interests to create a successful narrative surrounding the policy\u2019s purpose. We compare Denmark, which implemented and quickly repealed a tax on saturated fats in 2011-12, and Ireland, which implemented a sugar-sweetened beverage tax in 2018 that has remained in place. A tale of two taxes Our findings demonstrate how certain public health measures are made acceptable to the public. They tell us about the importance of narratives in the successful implementation of similar food taxes in Canada. They also raise questions about when similar narratives may be relevant to other types of public health measures. What shaped public discussion and controv",

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improv",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Keyword and reference searches were conducted in five electronic databases: Cochrane Library, EconLit, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (i) intervention: field experiments; (ii) population: adolescents 12\u201317 years old or adults 18 years and older; (iii) design: randomized controlled trials, cohort studies or pre\u2013post studies; (iv) subsidy: price discounts or vouchers for healthier foods; (v) outcome: food purchases or consumption; (vi) period: 1990\u20132012; and (vii) language: English. Twenty-four articles on twenty distinct experiments were included with study quality assessed using predefined methodological criteria. Interventions were conducted in seven countries: the USA (n 14), Canada (n 1), France (n 1), Germany (n 1), Netherlands (n 1), South Africa (n 1) and the UK (n 1). Subsidies applied to different types of foods such as fruits, vegetables and low-fat snacks sold in supermarkets, cafeterias, vending machines, farmers\u2019 markets or restaurants. Interventions enrolled various population subgroups such as school/university students, metropolitan transit workers and low-income women. All but one study found subsidies on healthier foods to significantly increase the purchase and consumption of promoted products. Study limitations include small and convenience samples, short intervention and follow-up duration, and lack of cost-effectiveness and overall diet assessment. Subsidizing healthier f",

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

What sweetens most \"unhealthy\" foods? Corn syrup -- the most over-subsidized crop in the US, the cheapest form of sweetener, and one of the sweetest and most addictive. Its introduction into almost every mass-produced, low-cost food item in our grocery stores is one of the primary reasons for the rise in childhood and adult obesity. Eat healthier, you say? Have you priced the cost of food in the supposedly-more-healthy \"whole food\" stores these days? These same corporations have made a secondary business catering to the well-to-do, who can afford to pay the premium for FDA-defined \"organic\" foods, meats and produce. You aren't making people healthier by imposing your fat tax...all you're doing is soothing your Politically Correct sensibilities by claiming it's a choice, while continuing to line the pockets of government and big business. If you truly cared about people's state of health and the cost to society, you'd lay the penalty where it belongs...with big business who make these products because they're cheaper, and with government who regulates food content and subsidizes the crops and practices that produce them.   Do you think that because you tax fatty foods, that obese people will suddenly or even eventually eat healthy? Taxing cigarettes doesn't stop people from smoking. If they no longer eat fatty foods because of the tax, what will be their \"next best\" choice? Tofu?

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

AuthorsRekha Nath*. 8.1. Introduction Should society adopt health care policies aimed at holding obese individuals responsible for obesity-related health problems?1 I will argue that it should not. More specifically, holding obese individuals responsible for obesity-related health problems would neither treat people as they deserve to be treated, nor make the distribution of health care resources fairer, nor produce better overall outcomes in the promotion of public health. The arguments to the contrary are based on dubious empirical assumptions, faulty philosophical reasoning, or both. 8.2. The Case for Holding Obese Individuals Responsible in Health Care Domains Obesity is widely regarded a major public health crisis. Being obese increases a person\u2019s risk of heart disease, diabetes, and over a dozen types of cancer, and it is associated with a lower life expectancy. In the United States, over 40 percent of the adult population is obese, and nearly one in five children\u2014some 14 million\u2014are obese (Hales et al. 2020; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2021). Since the 1960s, the obesity rate among American adults has near",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing p",

This study, conducted in an American city with 113 participating households, highlights the limitations of fat taxes in influencing sustained behavioral change.  Furthermore, the study revealed an unintended consequence: households purchasing beer increased their beer consumption in response to the tax. This substitution effect suggests that fat taxes may simply shift consumption to other unhealthy options, undermining the intended health benefits. While the study's limited geographical scope warrants further research, it casts doubt on the claim that fat taxes reliably encourage positive consumer behavior shifts."

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects every single one of us: our health.  Think about your last trip to the grocery store. Remember the colorful aisles packed with processed foods, sugary drinks, and salty snacks?  These tempting treats, while satisfying in the moment, often contribute to a growing public health crisis fueled by unhealthy diets.  That's why we stand firmly in favor of implementing a fat tax \u2013 a tax on foods and beverages high in sugar, fat, and salt.  This isn't about restricting choices; it's about investing in a healthier future for all of us.\n\nLet's start with the facts.  *Fat taxes demonstrably reduce the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages.*  A comprehensive review of 20 studies published in *Food Policy* clearly shows this.  Think of it this way: if something becomes more expensive, we naturally tend to buy less of it.  This study found consistent evidence of decreased sales and consumption of these less healthy foods, especially when combined with making healthier foods more affordable.  Now, some might worry about the impact on families with tighter budgets.  That's a valid concern, and that's why this same research shows that subsidies for healthy foods can effectively address this, making nutritious choices accessible to everyone.\n\nThis brings me to my second point: *fat taxes encourage healthier food choices and promote better overall diets.*  The same *Food Policy* review found that higher tax rates led to substantial reductions in the consumption of taxed foods, particularly when paired with subsidies for healthier alternatives.  Let's look at what happened in Mexico. They implemented an 8% tax on non-essential, energy-dense foods, and what happened?  Sales dropped \u2013 by 18% in supermarkets and up to a whopping 40% in other retailers.  Even Denmark, where a saturated fat tax was eventually repealed, saw a 4% reduction in saturated fat intake while it was in place.  These real-world examples show us that fat taxes can nudge us towards healthier options.\n\nNow, let's talk about the most important aspect: *fat taxes disproportionately benefit low-income communities*, the very people most affected by diet-related diseases.  These are the communities often facing barriers to healthy eating, like limited access to fresh produce and affordable healthy options.  Research suggests that lower-income groups are more sensitive to price changes and, therefore, more likely to respond to fat taxes.  The *Food Policy* review confirms this, showing significant reductions in their consumption of unhealthy foods.\n\nBut it doesn't stop there.  The money raised from fat taxes can be reinvested to further benefit these communities.  Imagine this: the revenue generated could be used to subsidize healthy food options, making them more affordable for everyone.  Or, it could fund targeted health programs addressing diet-related diseases within these communities.  According to research from [Source 4] and [Source 5], these types of reinvestment strategies have proven effective in improving community health outcomes.  This two-pronged approach \u2013 reducing unhealthy food consumption and increasing access to healthier options \u2013 has the potential to significantly improve the health outcomes of low-income populations and reduce health disparities.  This isn't just about health; it's about social justice and health equity.\n\nSo, where does this leave us?  Fat taxes are a necessary and effective tool for promoting public health. They demonstrably reduce unhealthy food consumption, encourage healthier choices, and disproportionately benefit vulnerable communities.  We urge you to support this motion and invest in a healthier future for all.  Thank you.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. Nnoaham, K. E., et al. (2024).

        "Friends, colleagues, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects us all: our health, our food, and our wallets.  We're here today to discuss a proposed fat tax, and I want to address some concerns raised by the opposing side.\n\nThey argue that a fat tax improves public health and encourages healthier choices. They point to Hungary's sugar tax, claiming an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed drinks.  That sounds promising, right?  But let's look closer.  Focusing just on sugar in *some* drinks misses the bigger picture. What about the rest of our diet?  What about the long-term effects?  A study in *The Lancet* shows that people often just switch to *other* unhealthy, *untaxed* things.  Remember Denmark's fat tax?  It didn't work and actually caused *more* problems, so they got rid of it.\n\nThey also say that higher prices will make people choose healthier options.  That sounds nice, but where's the proof?  A real-world experiment published in *Contemporary Economic Policy*, involving 113 households over six months, tells a different story.  A 10% tax on high-calorie foods *did* lower soft drink purchases at first, but only for *one month*.  Then, get this, people who bought beer actually bought *more* beer after the tax!  This shows a big problem: fat taxes can just make people switch to other unhealthy things, potentially making things *worse*.  This isn't just a one-off finding; multiple studies show this \"substitution effect.\"  So, the idea that fat taxes *always* lead to healthier choices just doesn't hold up.\n\nNow, they say we can fix the negative effects of a fat tax.  We agree that careful planning and helping low-income families are important. But that doesn't solve the basic economic problems.  These taxes hit low-income families harder because they spend a bigger part of their income on food.  Help programs can be useful, but they're not a magic bullet. They can create complicated systems and mess with how the market works, potentially causing *more* problems.\n\nLet's talk about the *real* benefits of a fat tax: the economic ones. These taxes bring in a lot of money that can go *directly* into public health programs.  Denmark's fat tax, for example, brought in \u20ac160 million a year!  That's like winning the lottery for public health!  Think of what that money could do: programs to prevent obesity, educational campaigns, and better access to healthy food, especially in communities that need it most.  This kind of investment can create real, lasting improvements in everyone's health.\n\nAnd there's more.  This money can also help with the huge costs of healthcare for diet-related diseases.  Think about heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers.  These diseases put a massive strain on healthcare systems everywhere.  The money from a fat tax can help pay for preventative care, research, and treatment, improving public health *and* making healthcare systems stronger in the long run.\n\nFinally, fat taxes encourage food companies to make their products healthier.  When there's a tax on sugar, companies want to lower the sugar in their products to avoid paying more.  This slowly but surely makes the food we buy healthier.  Studies show that taxes on sugary drinks have already led to lower sugar content, proving that taxes can push the food industry in a healthier direction.  This works *with* public health initiatives to create a healthier environment for everyone.\n\nSo, while the other side has some points, they don't address the big economic and public health benefits of a fat tax.  The money it brings in, the push for healthier products, and the chance to help low-income communities outweigh the potential downsides.  Let's support this and invest in a healthier, fairer future for all of us.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. Mytton, O. T., et al. (2020).

        "Friends, colleagues, let\u2019s talk about something that affects every single one of us: our health.  And more specifically, how we can build a healthier society *together*.  The question before us today is simple: Can a fat tax help us get there? We believe it absolutely can.\n\nNow, we\u2019ve heard some concerns about how a fat tax might change what people buy, and what it might mean for their wallets. Let\u2019s address those head-on.  The other side points to things like Hungary\u2019s sugar tax and some short-term studies on soda. They say, \u201cLook, people just switched to other unhealthy things!\u201d  But those examples don\u2019t tell the whole story. They miss the bigger picture.  They don\u2019t account for how our choices change over time, or how food companies adapt.  What we\u2019ve shown is that a fat tax can actually encourage companies to make their products healthier.  That\u2019s a real, lasting change that benefits everyone.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about cost.  Yes, a fat tax might seem like it hits lower-income families harder.  That\u2019s a valid concern. But consider this: the money raised from this tax can go right back into those communities.  Think about programs that make healthy food more affordable, or initiatives that educate people about nutrition.  *This isn\u2019t just about taxing; it\u2019s about reinvesting*.  And let\u2019s not forget the enormous cost of diet-related illnesses.  A fat tax can help us tackle that burden, freeing up resources for other essential services.\n\nSo, what are we really talking about here?  We\u2019re talking about an investment. An investment in healthier communities, a stronger economy, and a fairer future for all of us.  We\u2019re talking about making healthy choices easier for everyone, regardless of their income.  We\u2019re talking about a long-term vision, not just quick fixes.  We urge you to join us in supporting this motion. Let\u2019s invest in a healthier future, together. Thank you.\n"

        "In this debate, we shall argue that a fat tax, defined as a levy on foods and beverages high in fat, sugar, and/or salt, should be implemented to improve public health outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is the net societal benefit.  We will demonstrate that the benefits of a fat tax, including improved public health outcomes, revenue generation for health initiatives, and positive changes in consumer behavior, outweigh any potential negative consequences.\n\nFirst, a fat tax improves public health by reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and generating revenue for health initiatives.  Hungary's implementation of a similar tax resulted in an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed beverages (6). This demonstrates the potential for a fat tax to drive positive dietary changes.  The generated revenue can then be invested in public health programs targeting obesity prevention and education, magnifying the positive impact.  For example, revenue could fund subsidized healthy food programs, further encouraging healthier choices.\n\nSecond, a fat tax encourages positive shifts in consumer behavior.  When faced with increased prices on unhealthy options, consumers are more likely to seek healthier alternatives (4). This shift in consumption patterns contributes to a healthier population in the long term. As consumers adapt to the new pricing structure, they become more conscious of their food choices, fostering a culture of health and wellness.\n\nThird, the negative consequences of a fat tax can be mitigated through careful implementation and targeted support for low-income groups.  Concerns about regressive impacts can be addressed by using the generated revenue to subsidize healthy food options for low-income families (9). This ensures that healthier choices are accessible to all, regardless of income level. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can educate consumers on healthy eating habits and the rationale behind the tax, increasing acceptance and promoting positive behavioral change.\n\nIn conclusion, a fat tax, implemented strategically and thoughtfully, offers a significant net benefit to society by improving public health, encouraging positive consumer behavior changes, and generating revenue for targeted health initiatives.\n\nReference:\n(1)  FasterCapital.

        "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent argues that a fat tax effectively reduces unhealthy food consumption, encourages healthier choices, mitigates negative impacts on low-income families, and generates revenue for public health. However, their arguments rest on a flawed understanding of consumer behavior, a short-sighted view of economic realities, and a disregard for potential unintended consequences. We contend that a fat tax, while seemingly well-intentioned, ultimately fails to achieve its stated goals and may even exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nFirst, the opponent points to the Hungary sugar tax as evidence of the effectiveness of such taxes. While we acknowledge the observed reduction in sugar consumption in certain beverages, this example overlooks the complexity of consumer behavior.  The study they cited, while showing a decrease in *taxed* sugar-sweetened beverages, fails to account for the substitution effect, where consumers may switch to other, potentially equally unhealthy, untaxed products (1).  For a fat tax to be truly effective, it must address a comprehensive range of unhealthy foods, not just a select few.  Therefore, focusing solely on the Hungary example provides an incomplete and potentially misleading picture of how a broader fat tax would impact overall dietary habits and public health outcomes.  By failing to address this key issue, the opponent's argument for the effectiveness of a fat tax is significantly weakened.\n\nSecond, the opponent argues that higher prices inherently lead to healthier choices. However, this assumption ignores the complex interplay of economic factors and consumer preferences. The study they cited, showing temporary reductions in soft drink purchases, is limited by its short timeframe and fails to capture the longer-term dynamics of consumer behavior (2). Longer-term studies, like Andreyeva et al. (2010),  demonstrate that while initial price sensitivity may exist,  consumers often adjust their spending habits over time, sometimes even increasing consumption of other, less healthy substitutes (2). This underscores the importance of considering the broader economic context and the potential for unintended consequences when evaluating the impact of a fat tax on consumer choices.  Ultimately, their argument fails to demonstrate a consistent, long-term shift towards healthier diets as a direct result of price increases.\n\nThird, the opponent's claim that subsidies can fully mitigate the regressive impact of a fat tax on low-income families is overly optimistic.  While subsidies can certainly help improve access to healthy foods, they do not entirely address the fundamental issue of affordability.  Drewnowski and Eichelsdoerfer (2009) highlight the persistent economic challenges faced by low-income families in accessing nutritious diets, even with subsidies in place (3). Implementing a fat tax without addressing the underlying economic disparities could exacerbate existing inequalities, placing a disproportionate burden on those least able to afford it.  Therefore, the opponent's mitigation strategy, while well-intentioned, fails to adequately address the core issue of economic disparity and its impact on healthy food choices.\n\nFinally, the opponent emphasizes the economic benefits of a fat tax, particularly the revenue generated for public health programs.  While we acknowledge this potential revenue stream, it's crucial to recognize that economic benefits alone do not justify a policy that potentially harms vulnerable populations and fails to demonstrably improve overall public health. Our framework of net societal benefit requires considering *both* the economic and health impacts of a policy. The opponent's narrow focus on revenue ignores the potential negative consequences outlined above and thus provides an incomplete picture of the true societal costs and benefits of a fat tax. A truly beneficial policy must improve public health outcomes without exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nReference:\n(1) Powell, L. M., et al. (2013).

        "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today\u2019s debate revolves around a fundamental question: should the government dictate what we eat?  The proposition argues for a fat tax, claiming it promotes public health. We contend that this policy, while seemingly well-intentioned, infringes upon personal autonomy and exacerbates economic injustice, ultimately failing to achieve its stated goals.\n\nThe proposition\u2019s argument rests on the flawed premise that taxing specific \u201cunhealthy\u201d items leads to healthier diets overall.  This ignores the basic economic principle of substitution.  When faced with higher prices, consumers adapt, often switching to other, potentially *less* healthy, untaxed alternatives.  This isn't just theoretical; studies like Powell et al. (2013) demonstrate this effect with sugar-sweetened beverages.  Imagine a single mother already struggling to afford nutritious food for her children. A fat tax forces her to abandon the slightly healthier option, now beyond her budget, for a cheaper, less healthy alternative. This isn't promoting health; it's deepening economic hardship and limiting choices for those already most vulnerable.\n\nThis leads us to the core issue of economic justice.  The proposition suggests subsidies can mitigate the regressive nature of a fat tax, but this band-aid solution fails to address the systemic inequalities at play.  Low-income families already face significant barriers to accessing healthy foods, a reality documented by Drewnowski and Eichelsdoerfer (2009).  Imposing a fat tax further burdens these families, exacerbating existing economic inequalities instead of promoting healthier choices.  Instead of using a blunt instrument like taxation, which restricts individual autonomy and disproportionately impacts the vulnerable, we should focus on empowering individuals through education and improved access to affordable, nutritious food.\n\nA truly just and effective approach to public health respects individual autonomy and tackles the root causes of poor dietary habits \u2013 poverty, lack of education, and limited access.  We urge you to reject the proposition's restrictive and regressive policy and embrace a path that prioritizes education, empowerment, and economic justice.  Let's empower individuals to make informed choices, not dictate them.  Thank you.\n\nReferences:\n(1) Powell, L. M., et al. (2013).
