      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, let's talk about something really important today: the future of young people. We firmly believe that escaping from big cities, not returning to them, is the way forward for today\u2019s youth.  We're here to examine the realities facing young people and how this shift can truly empower them.\n\nNow, what do we mean by \"escaping big cities\"? We're talking about young people choosing to build their lives and careers in smaller towns, rural areas, or suburban communities. Places where life is more affordable, community ties are stronger, and opportunities are perhaps a little less conventional but no less valuable.\n\nOur argument rests on three key pillars: affordability, civic engagement, and stronger communities. Let's explore each of these.\n\nFirst, let's talk about affordability.  Think about trying to buy your first home.  It's a dream for many, but in big cities, it feels more like a fantasy.  The numbers tell a stark story: 81% of millennials in rural areas own homes, compared to just 58% in urban areas. That's a huge difference! Why? Because housing costs significantly less in smaller towns. Plus, there are programs like USDA loans specifically designed to help first-time homebuyers in rural areas. Escaping the city breaks the cycle of sky-high rents and lets young people invest in their future through *affordable homeownership*. This builds equity, provides financial security, and sets the stage for long-term stability.  It's about building a solid foundation, not just chasing an expensive dream.\n\nSecond, consider this: how much influence do you really have in a big city?  Smaller communities offer young people a chance to truly engage and make a difference. Tufts University\u2019s CIRCLE, a leading research center on civic engagement, highlights how crucial youth involvement is for both individual and community well-being. They emphasize the need for supportive environments that empower young people to take action.  Smaller communities naturally provide this support.  It's easier to connect with local government and community organizations.  Your voice is heard, and your contributions matter.  In smaller populations, diverse perspectives are needed and valued. This translates to real opportunities for leadership and direct involvement in shaping your community.  While big cities have resources, their sheer size can make individual efforts feel like a drop in the ocean. Smaller communities offer a tangible sense of impact, empowering youth to shape their environment and see the direct results of their engagement.\n\nFinally, let's talk about community.  Think about your closest friends.  Where did you meet them?  How did those relationships develop?  Studies show a link between urban living and decreased mental well-being due to social isolation. The constant hustle and competition in big cities can make it hard to build deep, meaningful connections.  Smaller towns offer a different experience. They're built on close-knit relationships and community involvement.  This fosters a strong sense of belonging and helps create lasting bonds.  While big cities offer diverse social scenes, their size and anonymity can make it tough to establish roots.  The close-knit fabric of smaller communities provides fertile ground for nurturing stronger, more meaningful relationships, ultimately leading to a higher quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities offers young people a path to a more fulfilling and prosperous future.  By embracing the affordability, civic engagement, and stronger communities found outside major metropolitan areas, young people can build lives grounded in financial security, meaningful contributions, and lasting relationships. We urge you to affirm the motion and support a future where young people can thrive, not just survive.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that escaping big cities, defined as relocating from a major metropolitan area to a smaller town, suburb, or rural area, is the optimal \"way out,\" or path towards a better future encompassing improved well-being, financial stability, and personal fulfillment, for young people (individuals aged 18-35).\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing overall well-being for young people, encompassing mental and physical health, financial security, and community engagement. This framework is appropriate because the motion concerns the best \"way out\" for young people, implying a focus on their overall quality of life.\n\nFirst, escaping big cities allows young people to achieve greater financial stability.  The high cost of living, particularly housing, in major metropolitan areas presents a significant barrier to financial security for young people.  For example, a 2022 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that in no state, including rural areas, could a full-time minimum wage worker afford a modest two-bedroom rental unit. (1)  Escaping to smaller towns and rural areas, where the cost of living is generally lower, enables young people to allocate their income more effectively, save for the future, and pursue opportunities for homeownership, all contributing to enhanced financial well-being.  The median home price in Q4 2023 in Manhattan, NY was \\$1 million, while the median home price in Bend, OR (a popular smaller city destination) was $535,000. (2)  This substantial difference in housing costs demonstrates the financial advantages of escaping big cities, freeing up resources for other important life goals.\n\nSecond, escaping big cities improves mental and physical well-being.  The fast-paced, competitive, and often isolating environment of large urban centers can negatively impact mental health, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.  A 2023 study published in the journal \"Cities & Health\" found a positive correlation between urban density and mental health issues among young adults. (3) Conversely, smaller communities often offer stronger social connections, increased access to nature, and a slower pace of life, all factors that contribute to improved mental and physical well-being.  Access to green spaces and outdoor recreational activities, often more readily available in smaller communities, promotes physical activity and reduces stress, as highlighted in a 2021 report by the World Health Organization. (4)\n\nThird, escaping big cities opens up diverse career and entrepreneurial opportunities. While certain industries may be concentrated in major metropolitan areas, the rise of remote work, the growth of the gig economy, and the increasing availability of high-speed internet in smaller towns and rural areas are creating a more geographically diverse job market.  A 2024 survey by Upwork found that 26.7% of the American workforce worked remotely. (5)  This allows young people to pursue careers in fields of their choice, regardless of location, while enjoying the benefits of a smaller community.  Furthermore, escaping big cities can foster entrepreneurship, as lower startup costs and a supportive local environment can encourage young people to launch their own businesses, contributing to both personal fulfillment and local economic development. A 2023 report by the Small Business Administration found that small businesses created 1.9 million net new jobs in 2022. (6)  This entrepreneurial spirit can revitalize smaller communities while offering young people a path towards self-sufficiency and career satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities provides a path towards a better future for young people, offering enhanced financial stability, improved mental and physical well-being, and diverse career and entrepreneurial opportunities. By embracing a life outside the confines of major metropolitan areas, young people can maximize their overall well-being and build a more fulfilling future.\n\nReference:\n(1) National Low Income Housing Coalition.

      "content": "Friends, neighbors, fellow citizens, have you ever felt that squeeze, that pressure of city life?  The crowded commutes, the sky-high rent, the constant hustle?  Many of us have.  And it's tempting to dream of escaping to a quieter, seemingly more affordable life in a smaller town.  Our opponents today paint a rosy picture of this escape, but I'm here to tell you, they're overlooking some crucial details.\n\nThey talk about financial stability.  Sure, houses might *look* cheaper in smaller towns. But let's be real, how much is that house worth if you can't find a decent-paying job?  Census data consistently reveals lower median incomes and higher poverty rates in rural communities.  Think about it \u2013 a lower-priced home doesn't mean much when you're earning less.  It's like seeing a great deal on a fancy coffee maker when you can barely afford groceries.  Yes, remote work is growing, but it doesn't magically create high-paying jobs everywhere.  Competition for these remote positions is fierce, and many still require you to be close to a big city for meetings and networking.  So, while the initial price tag on a house might be lower, the long-term financial picture is often much bleaker.  We believe that big cities, with their diverse job markets and higher earning potential, offer a much stronger path to financial security.\n\nNow, let's talk about well-being.  Our opponents praise the slower pace of life and the access to green spaces.  And yes, those things are nice.  But they conveniently ignore the challenges of accessing quality healthcare, especially mental healthcare, in smaller communities.  Imagine needing specialized care and having to drive hours to the nearest specialist.  A 2023 study in *Cities & Health* actually shows a correlation between urban density and mental health issues, but it *also* highlights the greater availability of mental health resources in urban areas.  Big cities offer a wider range of therapists, support groups, and specialized treatment options.  Plus, that \"slower pace of life\" can quickly become isolating, especially for young people looking for opportunities and connections.  Big cities offer a vibrant cultural scene, diverse social opportunities, and a constant flow of new ideas.  This can be incredibly enriching and stimulating, fostering creativity and a sense of belonging.\n\nFinally, let's address the claim about career opportunities.  Our opponents point to the rise of remote work, but they fail to mention the *quality* and *variety* of those opportunities.  A 2024 Upwork survey shows a rise in remote work, but it doesn't tell us what *kinds* of jobs are available or where they're located.  Many remote positions still require you to be near a big city for client meetings and networking events.  And what about starting your own business?  Smaller communities often have smaller markets, fewer investors, and less access to the resources entrepreneurs need.  Big cities, on the other hand, are hubs for startups and small businesses.  They offer access to talent, capital, and a supportive network of other entrepreneurs.  A 2023 Small Business Administration report shows that small businesses created millions of jobs, but it doesn't break down the geographic distribution of these jobs.  Many of these new businesses are concentrated in urban areas, where they can thrive.\n\nSo, while the idea of escaping the city might sound appealing, the reality is often more complicated.  Big cities offer greater financial opportunities, better access to resources, and a more stimulating environment for personal and professional growth.  These are crucial factors for young people building their futures.  We believe that big cities, while not without their challenges, offer a more robust and promising path to a successful and fulfilling life.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.

      "stage": "rebuttal",
      "side": "against",
      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are the alleged financial instability, lack of well-being, and limited career opportunities they associate with escaping large metropolitan areas.  Our side contends that escaping big cities offers young people a path to a more fulfilling life, encompassing financial security, enhanced well-being, and diverse career opportunities.  This holistic approach to a young person's future is what truly defines the best \"way out.\"\n\nFirst, the opponent argues that lower incomes in smaller towns negate the financial benefits of lower housing costs.  While it's true that incomes *can* be lower in some smaller towns, the opponent overlooks the significantly lower overall cost of living.  Accommodation costs, for example, are demonstrably lower in small towns. As resources like MoneyMow and Aditya Birla Capital point out, housing costs are generally much higher in cities.  This difference is not just about the sticker price of a house; it's about the overall cost of living, including groceries, transportation, and entertainment, which are all typically lower in smaller communities.  This allows for a higher disposable income and greater financial security, even with potentially lower salaries. Moreover, certain smaller cities are actively attracting young talent with financial incentives, further bolstering their financial prospects.  The BBC, for instance, has reported on US cities offering up to $15,000 to relocate.  Furthermore, the Richmond Fed reported in 2024 that wage growth in smaller cities and rural areas has been outpacing urban areas.  This, combined with lower overall living costs, contributes to greater financial stability for young people escaping big cities.\n\nSecond, they claim that smaller communities lack access to quality healthcare and lead to social isolation. This ignores the transformative growth and effectiveness of telehealth and remote healthcare services, which are bridging the gap in access to specialists. Resources like the NCBI highlight the growth of telehealth, particularly fueled by advancements in healthcare IT.  Furthermore, research by organizations like the NADO and ICMA points to the significant social capital and strong community support networks prevalent in smaller towns, directly countering the claim of social isolation. These tight-knit communities actively foster social connections and support, particularly beneficial for young families. While big cities offer a variety of amenities, studies have shown the negative impact of factors like long commutes and lack of access to nature, as highlighted by research from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Harvard University.  These factors contribute to increased stress and reduced well-being, drawbacks often overlooked by the opposition.  The slower pace of life and increased access to nature found in smaller towns actively promote both mental and physical health, crucial components of our overall well-being framework.\n\n\nThird, the opponent\u2019s assertion that big cities offer superior career opportunities is outdated in today's increasingly remote work environment. Forbes Advisor reports that 71% of remote workers find remote work improves their work-life balance, and 65% want to work remotely full-time.  This flexibility enables young people to live where they choose, decoupling location from career opportunities. The growth of remote work, as evidenced by companies like Aquent, PNC Bank, and Splunk embracing fully remote positions, allows individuals to pursue fulfilling careers regardless of location. Additionally, SCORE reports that rural small businesses show comparable revenue and profit to urban counterparts, demonstrating the viability of entrepreneurship in smaller communities.  The lower startup costs and supportive local environments in these areas, often coupled with initiatives like the creation of \"third spaces\" reported by Farmers Advance, can foster a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem.  Resources like Business Model Analyst offer numerous examples of successful startups in smaller communities, including grocery stores, auto repair shops, and carpentry businesses. These examples highlight the diverse opportunities available outside of major metropolitan areas, catering to a range of skills and interests.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) https://savingtoinvest.com/monthly-budget-comparison-big-city-10000-vs-small-town-4000/\n(2) https://www.moneymow.com/small-town-vs-big-city-what-are-the-pros-and-cons/\n(3) https://upgradedhome.com/small-town-living-vs-big-city/\n(4) https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/abc-of-money/cost-of-living-in-big-cities-vs-small-cities/\n(5) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57516592\n(6) https://www.richmondfed.org/region_communities/regional_data_analysis/regional_matters/2024/rm_08_15_24_labor_shortages_rural_urban\n(7) https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7577680/\n(8) https://www.nado.org/vibrant-rural-communities-case-study-series/\n(9) https://icma.org/small-towns-rural-communities-and-sustainability\n(10) https://search.library.wisc.edu/article/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_jebo_2021_10_028\n(11) https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/time-spent-in-nature-can-boost-physical-and-mental-well-being/\n(12) https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/\n(13) https://money.usnews.com/careers/articles/big-companies-that-hire-remote-workers/\n(14) https://www.score.org/resource/infographic/infographic-rural-entrepreneurship\n(15) https://businessmodelanalyst.com/small-town-business-ideas/\n(16) https://www.farmersadvance.com/story/life/2024/05/16/theres-hope-in-small-towns/73717279007\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Think about what really matters: a good life, strong relationships, and a real sense of belonging. Our opponents paint a rosy picture of big-city life, but let\u2019s be real, is that the whole story?\n\nThey talk about jobs, but haven't they heard of working from home?  Startups are booming everywhere, not just in skyscrapers.  They mention higher *potential* salaries, but forget about that tiny apartment eating up your paycheck.  When was the last time you looked at rent prices in a big city?  Forget owning a home \u2013 you\u2019re stuck renting forever.  They boast about city amenities, but what about real connections?  What about breathing fresh air and knowing your neighbors?\n\nEscaping the city isn't about *limiting* opportunities, it's about *creating* them.  Think about it: lower cost of living, wages rising in smaller towns \u2013 you're actually saving money, building a future.  Our opponents brought up Manhattan versus Bend, Oregon, but that\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle.  The Richmond Fed, MoneyMow, and Aditya Birla Capital all show how much cheaper it is to live in smaller communities across the board.  That\u2019s money in *your* pocket.\n\nAnd what about community?  According to the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) and the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), close-knit communities are key for happiness and well-being.  In a small town, you're not just a face in the crowd.  You can actually make a difference.  Tufts University\u2019s CIRCLE research shows how young people in smaller towns are shaping their communities.\n\nSo, let\u2019s choose a future where young people can thrive, not just survive.  A future built on financial security, strong relationships, and real community.  Let\u2019s choose a future where our kids can build their *own* success story.

We firmly believe it lies not in returning to the clamor of big cities, but in embracing the opportunities found in escaping them.\n\nThe opposition argues that big cities offer superior financial prospects.  Yet, they overlook a simple truth:  a larger paycheck doesn't equate to greater financial security when the cost of living consumes every gain. While Manhattan boasts higher average salaries, Bend, Oregon, a thriving hub for young professionals, offers a comparable quality of life at a fraction of the cost. This allows young people to build wealth, not just tread water.  Moreover, the rise of remote work is not just about flexibility; it's about democratizing opportunity, allowing young people to contribute to innovative industries from anywhere, unshackling their potential from expensive urban centers.\n\nThe opposition also raises concerns about healthcare access in smaller communities.  However, they fail to account for the transformative impact of telehealth, which is rapidly bridging geographical barriers and connecting individuals with specialists across the country.  Furthermore, we\u2019ve highlighted the rich social fabric of smaller communities.  This isn\u2019t just about friendly neighbors; it\u2019s about a deep sense of belonging and mutual support, an environment where young families thrive and individuals find genuine connection \u2013 a stark contrast to the often isolating experience of big city life.\n\nFinally, the opposition\u2019s argument regarding career opportunities rests on an outdated paradigm.  They claim that smaller communities lack the dynamic job markets of big cities.  Yet, they ignore the vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems flourishing in these very towns.  Lower startup costs, coupled with supportive local networks, empower young people to build their own businesses, contributing to both personal and community growth. This isn't just about finding a job; it's about forging your own path.\n\nEscaping big cities is not a rejection of ambition; it's a redefinition of success. It's about choosing a life grounded in genuine connection, balanced living, and the pursuit of self-actualization. It's about building a life of purpose, not just a career.  It's about choosing a life, not just a location. And that, esteemed judges, is the true way out, the path towards a richer, more fulfilling future for young people.\n\n\n"

Be sure to review the available federal and state programs designed specifically for first-time homebuyers, as well as the variety of low down-payment financing options offered by lenders, so you can enjoy the satisfaction of connecting first home to first loan. What a first-time homebuyer needs to qualify for a home loan The most common type of home loans available are conventional loans. These are loans that are financed by the private market, rather than a government program. Some conventional loans allow for a down-payment as low as 3%. These loans usually require a minimum credit score of 620 and they charge more as your credit score falls below 740 or if your debt-to-income (DTI) level rises. And they typically won\u2019t lend to a borrower with a DTI above 50%. First-time homebuyers should also consider several government-backed loan programs for their low or no down-payment options. FHA Loan Programs The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) operates under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The FHA single-family mortgage program provides access to safe, affordable mortgage financing for American families. FHA does not lend money to homeowners. Instead, FHA insures qualified loans made by private lending institutions. FHA will insure single-family loans with down-payments as low as 3.5% and also provides financing for condominiums and renovation loans. FHA does not require a minimum credit score and offers more flexibility when it comes to DTI ratios, but individual lenders might have their own requirements. Fees can be higher compared to conventional loans and FHA has a limit on the loan amount they will insure. VA Home Loan Guarantee Program The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan Guarantee Program is another government program that insures qualified loans made by private lending institutions.

While some argue that rural areas offer fewer job opportunities, the rise of remote work allows millennials to maintain urban employment while enjoying the lower cost of living in rural areas, further enhancing their ability to afford a home.

Youth Leadership Toward Community Development Source: https://pixabay.com/photos/people-leap-happiness-success-3509144/ is in the Public Domain at Pixabay.com. Retrieved 08.08.2022. According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, youth populations (aged 10-19) account for nearly 13% of the U.S. population, or 42 million individuals, as of 2019. The U.S. Census projects this number to increase significantly over the next 30-40 years. This represents a significant group that has largely been ignored until quite recently regarding leadership and participation in community projects and programs. This article will discuss ways in which we can distinguish between youth and adult leadership and provide strategies for how to empower and develop youth leaders in our communities. Youth Leadership v. Adult Leadership Youth and adult leaders are different. Multiple studies (e.g., McElravy & Hastings, 2014; Redmond & Dolan, 2016) have highlighted the differences between youth and adult leaders. Redmond and Dolan (2016) suggest that youth leadership \"focuses on the methods by which leadership can be explored, taught or experienced by young people.\" (p. 262). By contrast, adult leadership is described as being \"learned in the context of practicing leadership.\" (p. 262). McElravy and Hastings (2014) examined the links between personality, emotional intelligence, and self-leadership skills in youth, finding that personality is not a strong predictor of self-leadership skills, contrasting literature studying adults. Emotional intelligence was a strong predictor of self-leadership skills in youth, matching studies involving adults. The study's results suggest that only a few individual characteristics translate to self-leadership ability in both youth and adults, and we need to consider this in youth leadership development. \u00a0 Youth Leadership in the Community Eubanks Owens et al.

A study by Tufts University's CIRCLE highlighted the importance of youth participation in civic life for both individual and community well-being.  While access to information and opportunities is important, CIRCLE's research also emphasizes the crucial role of support in enabling young people to take civic action. Smaller communities, by their nature, often provide a more supportive environment where young people can readily access local government and community organizations. This ease of access, combined with a greater need for diverse voices in smaller populations, translates into more opportunities for leadership roles and direct involvement in local decision-making.  While some might argue that larger cities offer more resources, the sheer scale of these urban centers can make it difficult for young people to feel their contributions matter.  In contrast, smaller communities offer a tangible sense of impact, empowering youth to shape their local environment and experience the direct results of their civic engagement.",

The urban/rural divide is one of several inequities that affect youth civic engagement and often result in unequal outcomes, such as voting rates, that keep rural youth underrepresented in civic life. These inequities are often about access to information and opportunities, especially in communities that are more likely to be civic deserts. However, even when there is relatively equal civic access, the barriers faced by rural youth can run deeper, particularly as it relates to the quality and ultimate perception of such opportunities. A new analysis, based on CIRCLE\u2019s Pre-2024 Election Youth Survey of 18-to-34-year-olds, underscores these dynamics. We generally find similar levels of access and exposure to civic learning and engagement between rural and urban youth based on the limited measures we asked about, but significant gaps in support and civic culture. This new data supports the findings from the CIRCLE\u2019s 2023 learning community of rural leaders and practitioners, who shared that there are crises and barriers impacting rural youth\u2019s ability to participate long before they encounter any existing opportunities for learning and engagement. Our research brief\u00a0(linked below) based on insights from this community highlights those findings - many of which reflect dynamics that are difficult to capture in surveys - and offer a deeper",

Costs and benefits aside, this question affects our day-to-day lives in very tangible ways, beginning with the places we call home. The fact that cities are growing is undeniable. According to the United Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the urban global population has soared from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion today. This accounts for 55 percent of the world\u2019s population, which the UN projects will rise to 68 percent by 2050. In other words, more and more people are moving from small towns\u2014which are often the places that their family has called home for generations\u2014to large, urban cities. This phenomenon is not anything new; we saw a similar pattern of movement during the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the DotCom boom of the twentieth century. The continued shift to bigger cities is easy enough to understand: many are pursuing opportunities\u2014professional and social\u2014that they believe are uniquely available in urban areas. For some, moving to a city is an exciting chance to live in someplace new, a place different from their hometown. For others, it\u2019s a begrudging change they feel obligated or even forced to make because of professional or personal obligation. This latter group would most likely prefer to stay in the small community they call home if it were only feasible, which begs the question, what if it was?

At first glance, trading green fields for gray grids would seem to be a trade up. City slickers have, on average, more money, better food and greater access to health care than country folk. On the flip side, though, recent studies indicate that memory and attention can suffer in urban environments, and psychologists have long known that city life takes an emotional toll. Urbanites are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, and the risk of schizophrenia increases dramatically among people raised in a city. Some researchers have calculated that children born in cities face twice, if not three times, the risk of developing a serious emotional disorder as compared with their rural and suburban peers. These statistics may not surprise harried rush-hour commuters, but they are also not easily explained. Epidemiologists have ruled out the most obvious answers\u2014namely, that people at risk for developing emotional disorders are more drawn to urban areas.

Yet this urban migration represents one of the most dramatic environmental shifts human beings have ever undertaken. So one might be tempted to ask: How are we adapting to our new digs? At first glance, trading green fields for gray grids would seem to be a trade up. City slickers have, on average, more money, better food and greater access to health care than country folk. On the flip side, though, recent studies indicate that memory and attention can suffer in urban environments, and psychologists have long known that city life takes an emotional toll. Urbanites are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, and the risk of schizophrenia increases dramatically among people raised in a city. Some researchers have calculated that children born in cities face twice, if not three times, the risk of developing a serious emotional disorder as compared with their rural and suburban peers. These statistics may not surprise harried rush-hour commuters, but they are also not easily explained. Epidemiologists have ruled out the most obvious answers\u2014namely, that people at risk for developing emotional disorders are more drawn to urban areas. Instead certain aspects of metropolitan life appear to incline the brain toward menta",

We have seen a nationwide push from all sectors of industry toward this ambiguous \u201cbigger\u201d that is supposedly synonymous with \u201cbetter.\u201d But is bigger really better? Costs and benefits aside, this question affects our day-to-day lives in very tangible ways, beginning with the places we call home. The fact that cities are growing is undeniable. According to the United Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the urban global population has soared from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion today. This accounts for 55 percent of the world\u2019s population, which the UN projects will rise to 68 percent by 2050. In other words, more and more people are moving from small towns\u2014which are often the places that their family has called home for generations\u2014to large, urban cities. This phenomenon is not anything new; we saw a similar pattern of movement during the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the DotCom boom of the twentieth century. The continued shift to bigger cities is easy enough to understand: many are pursuing opportunities\u2014professional and social\u2014that they believe are uniquely available in urban areas. For some, moving to a city is an exciting chance to live in someplace new, a place different from their hometown. For others, it\u2019s a begrudging change they feel obligated or even forced to make because of professional or personal obligation. This latter group would most likely prefer to stay in the small community they call home if it were only feasible, which begs the question, what if it was? Small towns may not be the home of multinational corporations or the seemingly endless amenities that big cities offer. However, they do offer something that we all desire and ultimately need: community. \u201cWith fewer people often",

Increasing urbanization over the next three decades will be accompanied by a growing population of children and adolescents living in cities3. Shaping the aspects of urban life that influence youth mental health could have an enormous impact on adolescent well-being and adult trajectories4.

Data reveals a substantial difference in millennial homeownership rates: 81% in rural areas versus 58% in urban areas.  This disparity stems from significantly lower housing costs in smaller towns, coupled with financial incentives like USDA loans specifically designed for rural first-time homebuyers.  Escaping the city offers a viable path to affordable homeownership, enabling young people to build equity and financial security.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Young people in smaller communities benefit from greater civic engagement and local influence.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_1', 'query': 'Benefits of civic engagement for young people in small communities', 'title': 'Why Is Youth Civic Engagement Important? - CIRCLE', 'url': 'https://circle.tufts.edu/understanding-youth-civic-engagement/why-it-important'}, {'id': '5_2', 'query': 'Benefits of civic engagement for young people in small communities', 'title': 'Understanding Youth Civic Engagement | CIRCLE - Tufts University', 'url': 'https://circle.tufts.edu/understanding-youth-civic-engagement'}, {'id': '5_38', 'query': 'Comparison of youth civic engagement in small vs. large communities', 'title': 'Lack of Civic Support for Rural Youth May Lead to Lower Civic ...', 'url': 'https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/lack-civic-support-rural-youth-may-lead-lower-civic-engagement'}, {'id': '5_46', 'query': 'Role of schools in promoting civic engagement in small communities', 'title': 'Local Schools, Civic Engagement, and Community Spirit in Small Towns', 'url': 'https://www.brown.edu/academics/spatial-structures-in-social-sciences/local-schools-civic-engagement-and-community-spirit-small-towns'}]\n**Long Argument**: Young people escaping big cities for smaller communities often find themselves with significantly more opportunities for civic engagement and local influence.  A study by Tufts University's CIRCLE highlighted the importance of youth participation in civic life for both individual and community well-being.  While access to information and opportunities is important, CIRCLE's research also emphasizes the crucial role of support in enabling young people to take civic action. Smaller communities, by their nature, often provide a more supportive environment where young people can readily access local government and community organizations. This ease of access, combined with a greater need for diverse voices in smaller populations, translates into more opportunities for leadership roles and direct involvement in local decision-making.  While some might argue that larger cities offer more resources, the sheer scale of these urban centers can make it difficult for young people to feel their contributions matter.  In contrast, smaller communities offer a tangible sense of impact, empowering youth to shape their local environment and experience the direct results of their civic engagement.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Escaping big cities allows young people to develop stronger interpersonal relationships and community connections.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_5', 'query': 'Challenges of big city living for young people impacting relationships', 'title': 'How living in a city affects mental health - Medical News Today', 'url': 'https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mental-health-living-in-a-city'}, {'id': '6_8', 'query': 'Challenges of big city living for young people impacting relationships', 'title': 'Urban Living Raises the Risk of Emotional Disorders', 'url': 'https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/urban-living-raises-risk-of-emotional-disorders/'}, {'id': '6_10', 'query': 'Social connections and community involvement in small towns vs big cities', 'title': 'Small Towns, Big Communities | icma.org', 'url': 'https://icma.org/articles/pm-magazine/small-towns-big-communities'}, {'id': '6_47', 'query': 'Effect of urban environment on the quality of interpersonal relationships for young people', 'title': 'Making cities mental health friendly for adolescents and young adults', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10917657/'}]\n**Long Argument**: Studies show a strong correlation between urban living and decreased mental well-being due to social isolation (6_5).  The constant stimulation and competition in big cities can hinder the development of deep, meaningful relationships.  In contrast, small towns offer a close-knit environment where increased social interaction (6_10) and community involvement are the norm. This fosters a sense of belonging and facilitates the development of stronger interpersonal bonds. While some might argue that big cities offer more diverse social opportunities, the sheer size and anonymity can make it difficult for young people to establish roots and build lasting connections.  The close-knit nature of smaller communities provides a fertile ground for cultivating stronger, more meaningful relationships, ultimately contributing to a higher quality of life for young adults.  For example, \"Small Towns, Big Communities\" (6_10) highlights how smaller communities offer increased opportunities for engagement and a stronger sense of belonging, directly impacting the quality of interpersonal relationships.\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else.

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, let's talk about something really important today: the future of young people. We firmly believe that escaping from big cities, not returning to them, is the way forward for today\u2019s youth.  We're here to examine the realities facing young people and how this shift can truly empower them.\n\nNow, what do we mean by \"escaping big cities\"? We're talking about young people choosing to build their lives and careers in smaller towns, rural areas, or suburban communities. Places where life is more affordable, community ties are stronger, and opportunities are perhaps a little less conventional but no less valuable.\n\nOur argument rests on three key pillars: affordability, civic engagement, and stronger communities. Let's explore each of these.\n\nFirst, let's talk about affordability.  Think about trying to buy your first home.  It's a dream for many, but in big cities, it feels more like a fantasy.  The numbers tell a stark story: 81% of millennials in rural areas own homes, compared to just 58% in urban areas. That's a huge difference! Why? Because housing costs significantly less in smaller towns. Plus, there are programs like USDA loans specifically designed to help first-time homebuyers in rural areas. Escaping the city breaks the cycle of sky-high rents and lets young people invest in their future through *affordable homeownership*. This builds equity, provides financial security, and sets the stage for long-term stability.  It's about building a solid foundation, not just chasing an expensive dream.\n\nSecond, consider this: how much influence do you really have in a big city?  Smaller communities offer young people a chance to truly engage and make a difference. Tufts University\u2019s CIRCLE, a leading research center on civic engagement, highlights how crucial youth involvement is for both individual and community well-being. They emphasize the need for supportive environments that empower young people to take action.  Smaller communities naturally provide this support.  It's easier to connect with local government and community organizations.  Your voice is heard, and your contributions matter.  In smaller populations, diverse perspectives are needed and valued. This translates to real opportunities for leadership and direct involvement in shaping your community.  While big cities have resources, their sheer size can make individual efforts feel like a drop in the ocean. Smaller communities offer a tangible sense of impact, empowering youth to shape their environment and see the direct results of their engagement.\n\nFinally, let's talk about community.  Think about your closest friends.  Where did you meet them?  How did those relationships develop?  Studies show a link between urban living and decreased mental well-being due to social isolation. The constant hustle and competition in big cities can make it hard to build deep, meaningful connections.  Smaller towns offer a different experience. They're built on close-knit relationships and community involvement.  This fosters a strong sense of belonging and helps create lasting bonds.  While big cities offer diverse social scenes, their size and anonymity can make it tough to establish roots.  The close-knit fabric of smaller communities provides fertile ground for nurturing stronger, more meaningful relationships, ultimately leading to a higher quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities offers young people a path to a more fulfilling and prosperous future.  By embracing the affordability, civic engagement, and stronger communities found outside major metropolitan areas, young people can build lives grounded in financial security, meaningful contributions, and lasting relationships. We urge you to affirm the motion and support a future where young people can thrive, not just survive.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.

        "statements": "In this debate, we shall argue that escaping big cities, defined as relocating from a major metropolitan area to a smaller town, suburb, or rural area, is the optimal \"way out,\" or path towards a better future encompassing improved well-being, financial stability, and personal fulfillment, for young people (individuals aged 18-35).\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing overall well-being for young people, encompassing mental and physical health, financial security, and community engagement. This framework is appropriate because the motion concerns the best \"way out\" for young people, implying a focus on their overall quality of life.\n\nFirst, escaping big cities allows young people to achieve greater financial stability.  The high cost of living, particularly housing, in major metropolitan areas presents a significant barrier to financial security for young people.  For example, a 2022 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that in no state, including rural areas, could a full-time minimum wage worker afford a modest two-bedroom rental unit. (1)  Escaping to smaller towns and rural areas, where the cost of living is generally lower, enables young people to allocate their income more effectively, save for the future, and pursue opportunities for homeownership, all contributing to enhanced financial well-being.  The median home price in Q4 2023 in Manhattan, NY was \\$1 million, while the median home price in Bend, OR (a popular smaller city destination) was $535,000. (2)  This substantial difference in housing costs demonstrates the financial advantages of escaping big cities, freeing up resources for other important life goals.\n\nSecond, escaping big cities improves mental and physical well-being.  The fast-paced, competitive, and often isolating environment of large urban centers can negatively impact mental health, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.  A 2023 study published in the journal \"Cities & Health\" found a positive correlation between urban density and mental health issues among young adults. (3) Conversely, smaller communities often offer stronger social connections, increased access to nature, and a slower pace of life, all factors that contribute to improved mental and physical well-being.  Access to green spaces and outdoor recreational activities, often more readily available in smaller communities, promotes physical activity and reduces stress, as highlighted in a 2021 report by the World Health Organization. (4)\n\nThird, escaping big cities opens up diverse career and entrepreneurial opportunities. While certain industries may be concentrated in major metropolitan areas, the rise of remote work, the growth of the gig economy, and the increasing availability of high-speed internet in smaller towns and rural areas are creating a more geographically diverse job market.  A 2024 survey by Upwork found that 26.7% of the American workforce worked remotely. (5)  This allows young people to pursue careers in fields of their choice, regardless of location, while enjoying the benefits of a smaller community.  Furthermore, escaping big cities can foster entrepreneurship, as lower startup costs and a supportive local environment can encourage young people to launch their own businesses, contributing to both personal fulfillment and local economic development. A 2023 report by the Small Business Administration found that small businesses created 1.9 million net new jobs in 2022. (6)  This entrepreneurial spirit can revitalize smaller communities while offering young people a path towards self-sufficiency and career satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities provides a path towards a better future for young people, offering enhanced financial stability, improved mental and physical well-being, and diverse career and entrepreneurial opportunities. By embracing a life outside the confines of major metropolitan areas, young people can maximize their overall well-being and build a more fulfilling future.\n\nReference:\n(1) National Low Income Housing Coalition.

If you live and work in an urban setting, imagine for a minute what it might be like to live in a rural setting.

Many of ROI\u2019s staff have worked in both rural and urban settings. Here, we share some insights on the differences we\u2019ve observed working for nonprofit organizations in both types of communities. We\u2019ve found that they both creatively use resources to succeed and grow. In rural areas, connecting with a local school superintendent, sheriff, director of social services, or other key community leaders may be as simple as emailing and asking for a meeting. However, the same course of action in an urban setting will likely take months or even years of trying before successfully communicating with officials.\u00a0 This is because in rural areas, leaders serve a smaller population, often leaving more breathing room to help community organizations and build relationships with them. Urban officials often have large populations to tend to, making them less accessible to nonprofit organizations. Generally, compared to rural settings urban settings have access to many important resources. Urban organizations often receive more funding from investors and have larger populations to assist with their needs. In fact, only 3% of philanthropic dollars are allocated to rural communities in the US. However, when so much is at your fingertips, you might overlook opportunities to learn from others.

The lower cost of living in rural areas allows millennials to allocate more of their income towards saving for a down payment and comfortably afford mortgage payments.

It was 2020, and buying the same-sized unit in her neighborhood would have set her back at least $400,000. When her company went remote during the COVID-19 pandemic, she moved back to her hometown of Roanoke, VA. It was a temporary move, she thought. \u201cBut within a year, I realized that one of the biggest benefits of remote work is the ability to pick where I want to live without sacrificing a high-quality job,\u201d says the senior brand and content manager. In 2021, Austin bought a 1,700-square-foot home in Roanoke with three bedrooms and 1.5 bathrooms for $290,000, when interest rates were around 3%. \u201cI loved DC and never thought I\u2019d leave,\u201d says Austin, who\u2019s now 31. \u201cBut COVID changed a lot of things for a lot of people. When I realized we weren\u2019t going back into the office full time, I started to shift my perspective to realize that I could have a great quality of life in a smaller town.\u201d Still, she admits there are some trade-offs. \u201cDo I miss living in a bigger city? Absolutely,\u201d Austin says. \u201cBut the financial stability without having to sacrifice a great career is a win-win situation for so many individuals\u2014including me.\u201d (Cameron Austin) Small towns are gaining popularity It\u2019s the premise of millions of movies and songs: A young person flees their stifling small town for the bright lights of the big city. Well, now, the opposite is happening. Small towns and rural counties are attracting more millennials and Gen Zers, aged 25 to 44, according to a new study. \u201cRemote work and a tight labor market are continuing to allow many workers to have far more geographic flexibility in where they live,\u201d notes Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, in his analysis.

Living in a rural area isn\u2019t always as cheap as people assume. Let\u2019s start with some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis of urban vs rural living costs.

On average, households in urban areas earn $15,779 more than households in rural areas but they also spent $7,808 more than rural households. That leaves urban households have an extra $7,971 to save or invest. According to our Income Spending Simulator, over a period of 30 years, if that money were saved at rate of 5% it would add up to an additional $667,000 in net worth! However, the deeper you dive into the differences between urban and rural households, the blurrier the lines become in terms of which place is better for your budget and net worth.

When it comes to deciding between living in a small town or a big city, there are several factors to consider. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, and what may be better for one person may not be the ideal choice for another. Here are some key points to consider: 1. More access to everything In a big city, you will have better access to a wide range of amenities and services. Big cities offer a multitude of options for entertainment, dining, shopping, and cultural activities. You will find a diverse range of restaurants, museums, theaters, and shopping centers to explore. 2.

Violent crime rates in urban settings are notably higher, with 24.5 incidents per 1,000 people in 2021, compared to 11.1 per 1,000 in rural areas. This stark contrast extends to specific violent crimes like rape, robbery, and assault. Urban environments also see more firearm-related violent crimes. However, the property crime landscape tells a different story. Surprisingly, rural areas often experience higher rates of certain property crimes, particularly burglaries. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key crime rate differences: These statistics underscore the complex nature of criminal activity across different settings. Urban areas face greater challenges with violent crime, while rural communities grapple with specific property crime issues. Understanding these nuances is best for tailoring effective law enforcement strategies and public safety measures to each unique environment. Factors Influencing Crime in Rural Areas Rural areas face unique challenges that impact crime rates and patterns. I\u2019ve identified several key factors that contribute to criminal activity in these regions, based on my research and analysis. Socioeconomic Conditions Rural communities often grapple with economic hardships that can fuel criminal behavior. Limited job opportunities, lower income levels, and higher poverty rates create an environment where some individuals turn to illegal activities for financial gain. Substance abuse, particularly the opioid epidemic, exacerbates these issues. The lack of resources for mental health and addiction treatment in rural areas further compounds the problem, leaving many without the support they need to break cycles of criminal behavior. Community Cohesion While rural areas typically boast stronger social ties, this can have both positive and negative effects on crime rates. Tight-knit communities often lead to increased",

When it comes to deciding between living in a small town or a big city, there are several factors to consider. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, and what may be better for one person may not be the ideal choice for another. Here are some key points to consider: 1. More access to everything In a big city, you will have better access to a wide range of amenities and services. Big cities offer a multitude of options for entertainment, dining, shopping, and cultural activities. You will find a diverse range of restaurants, museums, theaters, and shopping centers to explore. 2. Better access to medical care Medical facilities in big cities have more advanced healthcare options and specialists compared to their small-town counterparts. If you prioritize access to top-notch medical care, living in a big city may be more beneficial for you. 3. Safer environment Statistically, small towns tend to have lower crime rates compared to big cities. The close-knit community in small towns often fosters a sense of safety and security. However, it is essential to be mindful that crime rates can vary and should not be the sole deciding factor. 4. Slower Pace Living in a small town provides an opportunity to slow things down. Life in big cities can be fast-paced and hectic, whereas small towns offer a more relaxed and laid-back lifestyle. If you prefer a slower pace of life and want to escape the hustle and bustle, a small town may be a better fit. 5. Job opportunities Big cities tend to have a wider range of job opportunities across various industries. Companies and businesses are often concentrated in urban areas, providing more options for employment. However, it\u2019s worth noting that competition for jobs in big cities can be fierce. 6. Cost of living Living expenses are typically higher in big cities due to the increased demand and cost of real estate, utilities, and other necessities. In contrast, small towns ge",

Several age groups \u2013 including young people and many millennials \u2013 are ditching city life for small towns. Suppose you are also considering moving from urban areas to rural areas. In that case, you might be asking yourself a straightforward question: Why are so many people\u00a0moving out of Denver\u00a0to smaller cities? Why Are People Moving to Small Towns? The reason why people are making a move from urban areas to rural settings is complex, and ultimately, there is not one simple explanation. For some people, the congested atmosphere of living in a big city isn\u2019t worth it, and they would rather spend their evenings with actual wildlife rather than in the urban jungle. Here are a few of the most common reasons why people are contacting Denver movers to relocate to small towns: Low Cost of Living From San Francisco and Portland to New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Atlanta \u2013 the cost of living in several metropolitan areas continues to rise. Living in a large city is often simply not feasible for several young people just starting out. Fewer people can afford to live in large cities when you consider the cost of everyday essentials \u2013 from your car and groceries to gas and utilities. Lower Cost Housing One of the biggest reasons people are leaving big cities is the cost of housing. To give you a better sense of just how cost-prohibitive living in a big city can be for most young adults and families, consider the average cost of renting a modest apartment in San Francisco, which is a whopping $3,340 a month! Usually, lower-cost housing is available in rural areas \u2013 but don\u2019t assume you have to move away from the hustle and bustle of a big city. If you want to enjoy greater economic health and more opportunities for high-paying jobs but still want to live in areas where houses are more affordable \u2013 the pros and Rocky Movers can provide you wit",

A few years back you could have sworn that you\u2019d never leave the big city and all the indisputable advantages that a big-city life can offer. But now, due to recent developments and drastic changes in the way you live and work, you may be seriously considering moving to a small town. In fact, you may have already started getting ready, little by little, to turn that previously unthinkable move into reality. Moving from a big city to a small town can easily prove to be one of the best decisions you\u2019ve made in a long time. Or you could end up regretting the choice to leave the large city, day in and day out. Therefore, before you make up your mind for real, it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re getting yourself into before it\u2019s too late. Here\u2019s what you have to know when moving to a small town from a large city.

But above all else, the move will be about your health and the health of your family, and nothing else can possibly top that. You\u2019ll discover that small-town life is healthier As a rule of thumb, the environment in a small town (population between 25,000 and 50,000 residents) is more laid back and relaxed than the hustle and bustle of city life, meaning that you\u2019ll get to experience first-hand the peace and quiet that smaller communities offer. Even time seems to be going a bit slower there and that\u2019s something that can have a hugely beneficial effect on your nervous system and your health in general.

If your career requires access to a wide range of job options or a specific professional network, moving to a smaller town might not be ideal.

Executive Summary The COVID-19 pandemic forced Americans across the country to reconsider their community preferences. Today, many Americans would prefer to live in small towns or rural areas rather than denser urban neighborhoods, and they are more likely to prioritize personal space over access to community amenities. When it comes to rating their communities, White Americans are more positive about their neighborhoods than are Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans. But White Americans are also less optimistic about the future of their communities than other groups are. Forty-three percent of Asian Americans, 42 percent of Black Americans, and 39 percent of Hispanic Americans say their communities will get better in the near future, compared to 30 percent of White Americans. Many Americans live close to at least some local amenities. Close proximity to amenities such as caf\u00e9s and parks increases neighborliness, feelings of safety, social trust, and positive feelings about the community. For Americans living in urban and suburban areas, greater amenity access is linked to higher levels of trust. More than three-quarters of high-amenity urbanites (76 percent) and sub",

Many of ROI\u2019s staff have worked in both rural and urban settings. Here, we share some insights on the differences we\u2019ve observed working for nonprofit organizations in both types of communities. We\u2019ve found that they both creatively use resources to succeed and grow. In rural areas, connecting with a local school superintendent, sheriff, director of social services, or other key community leaders may be as simple as emailing and asking for a meeting. However, the same course of action in an urban setting will likely take months or even years of trying before successfully communicating with officials.\u00a0 This is because in rural areas, leaders serve a smaller population, often leaving more breathing room to help community organizations and build relationships with them. Urban officials often have large populations to tend to, making them less accessible to nonprofit organizations. Generally, compared to rural settings urban settings have access to many important resources. Urban organizations often receive more funding from investors and have larger populations to assist with their needs. In fact, only 3% of philanthropic dollars are allocated to rural communities in the US. However, when so much is at your fingertips, you might overlook opportunities to learn from others.

The lower cost of living in rural areas allows millennials to allocate more of their income towards saving for a down payment and comfortably afford mortgage payments.

It was 2020, and buying the same-sized unit in her neighborhood would have set her back at least $400,000. When her company went remote during the COVID-19 pandemic, she moved back to her hometown of Roanoke, VA. It was a temporary move, she thought. \u201cBut within a year, I realized that one of the biggest benefits of remote work is the ability to pick where I want to live without sacrificing a high-quality job,\u201d says the senior brand and content manager. In 2021, Austin bought a 1,700-square-foot home in Roanoke with three bedrooms and 1.5 bathrooms for $290,000, when interest rates were around 3%. \u201cI loved DC and never thought I\u2019d leave,\u201d says Austin, who\u2019s now 31. \u201cBut COVID changed a lot of things for a lot of people. When I realized we weren\u2019t going back into the office full time, I started to shift my perspective to realize that I could have a great quality of life in a smaller town.\u201d Still, she admits there are some trade-offs. \u201cDo I miss living in a bigger city? Absolutely,\u201d Austin says. \u201cBut the financial stability without having to sacrifice a great career is a win-win situation for so many individuals\u2014including me.\u201d (Cameron Austin) Small towns are gaining popularity It\u2019s the premise of millions of movies and songs: A young person flees their stifling small town for the bright lights of the big city. Well, now, the opposite is happening. Small towns and rural counties are attracting more millennials and Gen Zers, aged 25 to 44, according to a new study. \u201cRemote work and a tight labor market are continuing to allow many workers to have far more geographic flexibility in where they live,\u201d notes Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, in his analysis.

Here are the differences between rural and urban living in terms of budget, housing, net worth and lifestyle. Whether you\u2019re thinking about moving to the city or away from a city, it is good to know what kind of budget items you\u2019ll be looking at and how they differ. Living in a rural area isn\u2019t always as cheap as people assume. Let\u2019s start with some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis of urban vs rural living costs. These statistics come from US Census data, which considers areas inside of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) \u201curban\u201d and those outside MSAs \u201crural.\u201d It\u2019s not a perfect measure, but it\u2019s usually not clear exactly where the city ends and the country begins, so you have to draw the line somewhere. On average, households in urban areas earn $15,779 more than households in rural areas but they also spent $7,808 more than rural households. That leaves urban households have an extra $7,971 to save or invest. According to our Income Spending Simulator, over a period of 30 years, if that money were saved at rate of 5% it would add up to an additional $667,000 in net worth! However, the deeper you dive into the differences between urban and rural households, the blurrier the lines become in terms of which place is better for your budget and net worth. Housing and Home Ownership There are large differences between rural and urban living in terms of the cost of housing, home ownership rates, and the percent of homes with a mortgage. Urban Rural Rural / Urban Housing Cost $17,226 $12,115 -29.67% Home Ownership 63% 83% +20% Home Paid Off In Full 37% 51% +14% In rural areas on average housing is about 30% cheaper, 20% more people own their homes, and 14% more own their home outright (with no mortgage). The differences between rural and urban living arrangements can explained by a few structural elements to rural life. Rural home ownership rates",

When it comes to deciding between living in a small town or a big city, there are several factors to consider. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, and what may be better for one person may not be the ideal choice for another. Here are some key points to consider: 1. More access to everything In a big city, you will have better access to a wide range of amenities and services. Big cities offer a multitude of options for entertainment, dining, shopping, and cultural activities. You will find a diverse range of restaurants, museums, theaters, and shopping centers to explore. 2. Better access to medical care Medical facilities in big cities have more advanced healthcare options and specialists compared to their small-town counterparts. If you prioritize access to top-notch medical care, living in a big city may be more beneficial for you. 3. Safer environment Statistically, small towns tend to have lower crime rates compared to big cities. The close-knit community in small towns often fosters a sense of safety and security. However, it is essential to be mindful that crime rates can vary and should not be the sole deciding factor. 4. Slower Pace Living in a small town provides an opportunity to slow things down. Life in big cities can be fast-paced and hectic, whereas small towns offer a more relaxed and laid-back lifestyle. If you prefer a slower pace of life and want to escape the hustle and bustle, a small town may be a better fit. 5. Job opportunities Big cities tend to have a wider range of job opportunities across various industries. Companies and businesses are often concentrated in urban areas, providing more options for employment. However, it\u2019s worth noting that competition for jobs in big cities can be fierce. 6.

While many people dream of bustling metropolises and the bright lights of big cities, others find solace in the charm and simplicity of smaller towns. In this blog post, we will explore the pros and cons of moving to a smaller town or city, helping you make an informed decision about your next move. Pros of Moving to a Smaller Town or City: Tight-knit Community: One of the most significant advantages of moving to a smaller town or city is the strong sense of community. In close-knit communities, people tend to know their neighbors, and a friendly atmosphere prevails. This can lead to a support network that feels like an extended family, with people ready to lend a helping hand when needed. Lower Cost of Living: Smaller towns often offer a more affordable cost of living compared to larger cities. Housing prices, utility bills, and everyday expenses are generally lower, allowing you to stretch your budget further. This can be particularly advantageous for young families, retirees, or those looking to save money. Reduced Traffic and Noise: One of the drawbacks of big cities is the constant hustle and bustle, along with the never-ending traffic congestion. In smaller towns, traffic is generally lighter, making commuting a breeze and reducing daily stress. Additionally, the noise levels are usually lower, providing a peaceful and serene environment for relaxation. Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City: Limited Job Opportunities: Smaller towns may have a limited number of job opportunities, especially in specialized industries.

Several age groups \u2013 including young people and many millennials \u2013 are ditching city life for small towns. Suppose you are also considering moving from urban areas to rural areas. In that case, you might be asking yourself a straightforward question: Why are so many people\u00a0moving out of Denver\u00a0to smaller cities? Why Are People Moving to Small Towns? The reason why people are making a move from urban areas to rural settings is complex, and ultimately, there is not one simple explanation. For some people, the congested atmosphere of living in a big city isn\u2019t worth it, and they would rather spend their evenings with actual wildlife rather than in the urban jungle. Here are a few of the most common reasons why people are contacting Denver movers to relocate to small towns: Low Cost of Living From San Francisco and Portland to New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Atlanta \u2013 the cost of living in several metropolitan areas continues to rise. Living in a large city is often simply not feasible for several young people just starting out. Fewer people can afford to live in large cities when you consider the cost of everyday essentials \u2013 from your car and groceries to gas and utilities. Lower Cost Housing One of the biggest reasons people are leaving big cities is the cost of housing. To give you a better sense of just how cost-prohibitive living in a big city can be for most young adults and families, consider the average cost of renting a modest apartment in San Francisco, which is a whopping $3,340 a month! Usually, lower-cost housing is available in rural areas \u2013 but don\u2019t assume you have to move away from the hustle and bustle of a big city.

A few years back you could have sworn that you\u2019d never leave the big city and all the indisputable advantages that a big-city life can offer. But now, due to recent developments and drastic changes in the way you live and work, you may be seriously considering moving to a small town. In fact, you may have already started getting ready, little by little, to turn that previously unthinkable move into reality. Moving from a big city to a small town can easily prove to be one of the best decisions you\u2019ve made in a long time. Or you could end up regretting the choice to leave the large city, day in and day out. Therefore, before you make up your mind for real, it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re getting yourself into before it\u2019s too late. Here\u2019s what you have to know when moving to a small town from a large city.

But above all else, the move will be about your health and the health of your family, and nothing else can possibly top that. You\u2019ll discover that small-town life is healthier As a rule of thumb, the environment in a small town (population between 25,000 and 50,000 residents) is more laid back and relaxed than the hustle and bustle of city life, meaning that you\u2019ll get to experience first-hand the peace and quiet that smaller communities offer. Even time seems to be going a bit slower there and that\u2019s something that can have a hugely beneficial effect on your nervous system and your health in general.

Red Lodge Area Community Foundation Newcomers Gathering Not actually a party, but for sure a Newcomers Gathering. In Bennettsville, SC they hold one once or twice a year. The realtors personally invite the folks they sold homes or rented homes to come. Of course there\u2019s some kind of food! Then the newcomers get to meet each other, ask questions of the locals who are there. Things like \u2018can I burn my garbage\u2019 or \u2018who should I talk to about starting a new business.\u2019 This is a perfect opportunity for your nonprofits to visit and share some ways these new folks get could more involved. Red Lodge, Montana holds newcomer gatherings too. They are an outdoor activity kind of town, and they share lots of information on participating in those kind of events. What are some reasons why you might NOT want to move from a big city to a smaller town? The great urban/rural divide has many misconceptions. These misconceptions keep city people in their cities. Two of the most common are: It\u2019s important for small towns to tell their stories. Tourists are looking to experie",

(561) 510-7191 Pros and Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City Pros and Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City Moving to a new town or city is an exciting prospect that offers a fresh start and an opportunity for growth. While many people dream of bustling metropolises and the bright lights of big cities, others find solace in the charm and simplicity of smaller towns. In this blog post, we will explore the pros and cons of moving to a smaller town or city, helping you make an informed decision about your next move. Pros of Moving to a Smaller Town or City: Tight-knit Community: One of the most significant advantages of moving to a smaller town or city is the strong sense of community. In close-knit communities, people tend to know their neighbors, and a friendly atmosphere prevails. This can lead to a support network that feels like an extended family, with people ready to lend a helping hand when needed. Lower Cost of Living: Smaller towns often offer a more affordable cost of living compared to larger cities. Housing prices, utility bills, and everyday expenses are generally lower, allowing you to stretch your budget further. This can be particularly advantageous for young families, retirees, or those looking to save money. Reduced Traffic and Noise: One of the drawbacks of big cities is the constant hustle and bustle, along with the never-ending traffic congestion. In smaller towns, traffic is generally lighter, making commuting a breeze and reducing daily stress. Additionally, the noise levels are usually lower, providing a peaceful and serene environment for relaxation. Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City: Limited Job Opportunities: Smaller towns may have a limited number of job opportunities, especially in specialized industries. If your career requires access to a wide range of job options or a specific professional network, moving to a smaller town might not be ideal. However, with the rise of remote work, many individuals have the freedom to work from anyw",

Executive Summary The COVID-19 pandemic forced Americans across the country to reconsider their community preferences. Today, many Americans would prefer to live in small towns or rural areas rather than denser urban neighborhoods, and they are more likely to prioritize personal space over access to community amenities. When it comes to rating their communities, White Americans are more positive about their neighborhoods than are Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans. But White Americans are also less optimistic about the future of their communities than other groups are. Forty-three percent of Asian Americans, 42 percent of Black Americans, and 39 percent of Hispanic Americans say their communities will get better in the near future, compared to 30 percent of White Americans. Many Americans live close to at least some local amenities. Close proximity to amenities such as caf\u00e9s and parks increases neighborliness, feelings of safety, social trust, and positive feelings about the community. For Americans living in urban and suburban areas, greater amenity access is linked to higher levels of trust. More than three-quarters of high-amenity urbanites (76 percent) and sub",

Census data reveals lower median incomes and higher poverty rates in rural communities.  While housing may be cheaper, limited job opportunities and lower wages hinder long-term financial growth, making it difficult to afford even lower-priced homes.  The rise of remote work doesn't guarantee high-paying jobs in these areas.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: Escaping big cities offers young people a more affordable path to homeownership.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_0', 'query': 'Millennial homeownership rates in rural areas compared to urban areas', 'title': 'Homes on the Range: Homeownership Rates Are Higher in Rural America', 'url': 'https://www.census.gov/newsroom/blogs/random-samplings/2016/12/homes_on_the_range.html'}, {'id': '0_1', 'query': 'Millennial homeownership rates in rural areas compared to urban areas', 'title': 'Homeownership Higher in Rural Areas - Census.gov', 'url': 'https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/09/rural-home-ownership.html'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Homeownership rates for millennials are significantly higher in rural areas (81%) compared to urban areas (59%), offering a more affordable path to owning a home.  Lower housing costs in rural areas make homeownership more attainable for young people.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Young people escaping big cities enjoy increased safety and security due to lower crime rates and stronger community ties.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_10', 'query': 'Social connections and community involvement in small towns vs big cities', 'title': 'Small Towns, Big Communities | icma.org', 'url': 'https://icma.org/articles/pm-magazine/small-towns-big-communities'}, {'id': '8_0', 'query': 'Safety and security differences between rural areas and large cities for young people', 'title': 'Rural vs Urban Crime Rates - Rural Crime and Security', 'url': 'https://ruralcrimeandsecurity.com/rural-vs-urban-crime-rates/'}, {'id': '8_5', 'query': 'Crime rates in rural areas compared to urban areas', 'title': 'Rural vs Urban Crime Rates - Rural Crime and Security', 'url': 'https://ruralcrimeandsecurity.com/rural-vs-urban-crime-rates/'}, {'id': '8_11', 'query': 'Sense of community and safety in small towns compared to big cities', 'title': 'Is it better to live in small town or big city?', 'url': 'https://www.ncesc.com/geographic-faq/is-it-better-to-live-in-small-town-or-big-city/'}]\n**Long Argument**: A 2021 analysis of crime data (8_5) reveals significantly lower violent crime rates in rural areas compared to urban areas (24.5 per 1,000 vs 11.1 per 1,000). While property crime rates can be higher in rural areas, the primary safety concern for young people is often violent crime.  Furthermore, research from ICMA (6_10) highlights the strong sense of community in smaller towns, where engagement with residents is easier and social connections are more prevalent. This close-knit environment fosters increased vigilance, mutual support, and a greater sense of security. While some might argue that isolation in rural areas can be a safety concern, the benefits of lower crime rates and stronger community ties generally outweigh this risk for young people, leading to an overall increase in safety and security.  The opponent's argument about increased career opportunities through remote work does not negate the safety benefits of smaller communities, as remote work can be performed from anywhere with internet access.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Escaping big cities fosters greater work-life balance for young people, enabling them to prioritize personal well-being and community engagement.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_0', 'query': 'Benefits of moving from a big city to a smaller town for young people', 'title': 'Small Towns or Big Cities? - Building Possibility', 'url': 'https://buildingpossibility.com/articles/small-towns-or-big-cities/'}, {'id': '4_2', 'query': 'Benefits of moving from a big city to a smaller town for young people', 'title': 'Pros and Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City', 'url': 'https://safeboundmoving.com/pros-and-cons-of-moving-to-a-smaller-town-or-city/'}, {'id': '6_13', 'query': 'Social connections and community involvement in small towns vs big cities', 'title': 'Public Places and Commercial Spaces: How Neighborhood Amenities Foster ...', 'url': 'https://www.americansurveycenter.org/research/public-places-and-commercial-spaces-how-neighborhood-amenities-foster-trust-and-connection-in-american-communities/'}]\n**Long Argument**: A 2021 American Survey Center report (6_13) highlights a shift in priorities, with many Americans now favoring smaller communities over dense urban areas. This preference is driven by a desire for stronger social connections and a greater emphasis on personal space.  Smaller towns, with their tight-knit communities (4_2) and reduced daily stress from factors like traffic (4_2), directly address these needs. While some might argue about limited job opportunities, the rise of remote work (4_0) mitigates this concern, further enabling young people to achieve work-life balance in smaller towns. The combination of reduced stress, increased community involvement, and remote work flexibility creates a powerful synergy that fosters work-life balance in a way that big cities struggle to replicate.\n\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else. \n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, neighbors, fellow citizens, have you ever felt that squeeze, that pressure of city life?  The crowded commutes, the sky-high rent, the constant hustle?  Many of us have.  And it's tempting to dream of escaping to a quieter, seemingly more affordable life in a smaller town.  Our opponents today paint a rosy picture of this escape, but I'm here to tell you, they're overlooking some crucial details.\n\nThey talk about financial stability.  Sure, houses might *look* cheaper in smaller towns. But let's be real, how much is that house worth if you can't find a decent-paying job?  Census data consistently reveals lower median incomes and higher poverty rates in rural communities.  Think about it \u2013 a lower-priced home doesn't mean much when you're earning less.  It's like seeing a great deal on a fancy coffee maker when you can barely afford groceries.  Yes, remote work is growing, but it doesn't magically create high-paying jobs everywhere.  Competition for these remote positions is fierce, and many still require you to be close to a big city for meetings and networking.  So, while the initial price tag on a house might be lower, the long-term financial picture is often much bleaker.  We believe that big cities, with their diverse job markets and higher earning potential, offer a much stronger path to financial security.\n\nNow, let's talk about well-being.  Our opponents praise the slower pace of life and the access to green spaces.  And yes, those things are nice.  But they conveniently ignore the challenges of accessing quality healthcare, especially mental healthcare, in smaller communities.  Imagine needing specialized care and having to drive hours to the nearest specialist.  A 2023 study in *Cities & Health* actually shows a correlation between urban density and mental health issues, but it *also* highlights the greater availability of mental health resources in urban areas.  Big cities offer a wider range of therapists, support groups, and specialized treatment options.  Plus, that \"slower pace of life\" can quickly become isolating, especially for young people looking for opportunities and connections.  Big cities offer a vibrant cultural scene, diverse social opportunities, and a constant flow of new ideas.  This can be incredibly enriching and stimulating, fostering creativity and a sense of belonging.\n\nFinally, let's address the claim about career opportunities.  Our opponents point to the rise of remote work, but they fail to mention the *quality* and *variety* of those opportunities.  A 2024 Upwork survey shows a rise in remote work, but it doesn't tell us what *kinds* of jobs are available or where they're located.  Many remote positions still require you to be near a big city for client meetings and networking events.  And what about starting your own business?  Smaller communities often have smaller markets, fewer investors, and less access to the resources entrepreneurs need.  Big cities, on the other hand, are hubs for startups and small businesses.  They offer access to talent, capital, and a supportive network of other entrepreneurs.  A 2023 Small Business Administration report shows that small businesses created millions of jobs, but it doesn't break down the geographic distribution of these jobs.  Many of these new businesses are concentrated in urban areas, where they can thrive.\n\nSo, while the idea of escaping the city might sound appealing, the reality is often more complicated.  Big cities offer greater financial opportunities, better access to resources, and a more stimulating environment for personal and professional growth.  These are crucial factors for young people building their futures.  We believe that big cities, while not without their challenges, offer a more robust and promising path to a successful and fulfilling life.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are the alleged financial instability, lack of well-being, and limited career opportunities they associate with escaping large metropolitan areas.  Our side contends that escaping big cities offers young people a path to a more fulfilling life, encompassing financial security, enhanced well-being, and diverse career opportunities.  This holistic approach to a young person's future is what truly defines the best \"way out.\"\n\nFirst, the opponent argues that lower incomes in smaller towns negate the financial benefits of lower housing costs.  While it's true that incomes *can* be lower in some smaller towns, the opponent overlooks the significantly lower overall cost of living.  Accommodation costs, for example, are demonstrably lower in small towns. As resources like MoneyMow and Aditya Birla Capital point out, housing costs are generally much higher in cities.  This difference is not just about the sticker price of a house; it's about the overall cost of living, including groceries, transportation, and entertainment, which are all typically lower in smaller communities.  This allows for a higher disposable income and greater financial security, even with potentially lower salaries. Moreover, certain smaller cities are actively attracting young talent with financial incentives, further bolstering their financial prospects.  The BBC, for instance, has reported on US cities offering up to $15,000 to relocate.  Furthermore, the Richmond Fed reported in 2024 that wage growth in smaller cities and rural areas has been outpacing urban areas.  This, combined with lower overall living costs, contributes to greater financial stability for young people escaping big cities.\n\nSecond, they claim that smaller communities lack access to quality healthcare and lead to social isolation. This ignores the transformative growth and effectiveness of telehealth and remote healthcare services, which are bridging the gap in access to specialists. Resources like the NCBI highlight the growth of telehealth, particularly fueled by advancements in healthcare IT.  Furthermore, research by organizations like the NADO and ICMA points to the significant social capital and strong community support networks prevalent in smaller towns, directly countering the claim of social isolation. These tight-knit communities actively foster social connections and support, particularly beneficial for young families. While big cities offer a variety of amenities, studies have shown the negative impact of factors like long commutes and lack of access to nature, as highlighted by research from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Harvard University.  These factors contribute to increased stress and reduced well-being, drawbacks often overlooked by the opposition.  The slower pace of life and increased access to nature found in smaller towns actively promote both mental and physical health, crucial components of our overall well-being framework.\n\n\nThird, the opponent\u2019s assertion that big cities offer superior career opportunities is outdated in today's increasingly remote work environment. Forbes Advisor reports that 71% of remote workers find remote work improves their work-life balance, and 65% want to work remotely full-time.  This flexibility enables young people to live where they choose, decoupling location from career opportunities. The growth of remote work, as evidenced by companies like Aquent, PNC Bank, and Splunk embracing fully remote positions, allows individuals to pursue fulfilling careers regardless of location. Additionally, SCORE reports that rural small businesses show comparable revenue and profit to urban counterparts, demonstrating the viability of entrepreneurship in smaller communities.  The lower startup costs and supportive local environments in these areas, often coupled with initiatives like the creation of \"third spaces\" reported by Farmers Advance, can foster a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem.  Resources like Business Model Analyst offer numerous examples of successful startups in smaller communities, including grocery stores, auto repair shops, and carpentry businesses. These examples highlight the diverse opportunities available outside of major metropolitan areas, catering to a range of skills and interests.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) https://savingtoinvest.com/monthly-budget-comparison-big-city-10000-vs-small-town-4000/\n(2) https://www.moneymow.com/small-town-vs-big-city-what-are-the-pros-and-cons/\n(3) https://upgradedhome.com/small-town-living-vs-big-city/\n(4) https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/abc-of-money/cost-of-living-in-big-cities-vs-small-cities/\n(5) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57516592\n(6) https://www.richmondfed.org/region_communities/regional_data_analysis/regional_matters/2024/rm_08_15_24_labor_shortages_rural_urban\n(7) https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7577680/\n(8) https://www.nado.org/vibrant-rural-communities-case-study-series/\n(9) https://icma.org/small-towns-rural-communities-and-sustainability\n(10) https://search.library.wisc.edu/article/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_jebo_2021_10_028\n(11) https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/time-spent-in-nature-can-boost-physical-and-mental-well-being/\n(12) https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/\n(13) https://money.usnews.com/careers/articles/big-companies-that-hire-remote-workers/\n(14) https://www.score.org/resource/infographic/infographic-rural-entrepreneurship\n(15) https://businessmodelanalyst.com/small-town-business-ideas/\n(16) https://www.farmersadvance.com/story/life/2024/05/16/theres-hope-in-small-towns/73717279007\n\n\n\n\n\n",

How Millennial Homeownership Is Reshaping the Market Reviewed Updated: Nov 2, 2023, 2:38pm 2022 marked the first time that more than 50% of Millennials were homeowners, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau Current Population Survey data. In 2020 and 2021, many Millennials took advantage of low interest rates and increased opportunities for remote work and entered the housing market. Things have looked less rosy since. With the ongoing housing shortage and a more than doubling of interest rates, home prices and monthly payments are now out of reach for many first-time home buyers. According to data from the National Association of Realtors (NAR), the qualifying income required for the average starter home rose to more than $96,000 in the second quarter of 2023. In 2020, it only took $49,000 in qualifying income to buy a starter home. How Millennials Are Buying in a Changing Housing Market To understand Millennial home buyers, you have to understand their experience of the housing market, which has taken some wild rides since the turn of the century. Older Millennials have been adults during its most trying periods: the early aughts housing bubble, no-doc zero-down loans, overbuilding, the foreclosure crisis and the Great Recession. In the 2010s, younger Millennials came of age thinking that 3% mortgage rates and housing shortages were normal; older Millennials recognized what might be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy or refinance with money that was practically free after accounting for inflation. Then the pandemic changed where people wanted to live and work, and monetary policies designed to forestall a recession stoked inflation. Excess demand, material and labor shortages and a major foreign war got us to where we are today. Many Millennials who aren\u2019t already homeowners wonder if they\u2019ll ever have the chan",

But the latest U.S. Census Bureau figures show the revival was short-lived. Americans have continued to flee large metro areas in massive numbers as the remote work shift sparked by the pandemic becomes entrenched and the allure of more affordable midsize cities and smaller towns grows. Big cities are still seeing modest population gains because of a surge in international immigrants but at a slower rate than before the health crisis, Goldman Sachs said in a recent research note. And they\u2019re losing the battle to keep and attract U.S. residents, a development that started before the pandemic but was magnified by the health crisis. \u201cMaybe there isn\u2019t going to be a rebound,\u201d says Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the University of Virginia. \u201cMaybe the rebound is over.\u201d For big cities, there is a small silver lining.

Stronger population growth in smaller towns has led to a faster rise in home prices compared to the pre-pandemic trend and a slower housing price pickup in large cities, the Goldman analysis shows. That has modestly narrowed the yawning gap in home values between large and small cities, at least in some areas, possibly drawing some residents to densely populated metro areas or prodding some renters in those cities to buy houses rather than bolt to smaller communities. Are people moving away from large cities? After a prolonged decline in the 1960s and 1970s, large cities were revitalized in the 1990s as young professionals were drawn to their cultural and social amenities.

It was 2020, and buying the same-sized unit in her neighborhood would have set her back at least $400,000. When her company went remote during the COVID-19 pandemic, she moved back to her hometown of Roanoke, VA. It was a temporary move, she thought. \u201cBut within a year, I realized that one of the biggest benefits of remote work is the ability to pick where I want to live without sacrificing a high-quality job,\u201d says the senior brand and content manager. In 2021, Austin bought a 1,700-square-foot home in Roanoke with three bedrooms and 1.5 bathrooms for $290,000, when interest rates were around 3%. \u201cI loved DC and never thought I\u2019d leave,\u201d says Austin, who\u2019s now 31. \u201cBut COVID changed a lot of things for a lot of people. When I realized we weren\u2019t going back into the office full time, I started to shift my perspective to realize that I could have a great quality of life in a smaller town.\u201d Still, she admits there are some trade-offs. \u201cDo I miss living in a bigger city? Absolutely,\u201d Austin says. \u201cBut the financial stability without having to sacrifice a great career is a win-win situation for so many individuals\u2014including me.\u201d (Cameron Austin) Small towns are gaining popularity It\u2019s the premise of millions of movies and songs: A young person flees their stifling small town for the bright lights of the big city. Well, now, the opposite is happening.

Millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers are leaving big cities for small-town life. Since 2014, around 30,000 city dwellers aged 24-40 have fled the city rat race yearly for small towns.\u00a0 The pandemic accelerated this trend of young people moving to small towns in their 20s and 30s. CNBC reports 32% of Gen Z and 26% of millennials relocated to smaller towns and rural areas during the pandemic. Key reasons include being closer to family/friends (31%), more affordable living (27%), or working remotely (17%). Let's dive deeper into why young people move to small towns: \u00a0 REASONS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO SMALL TOWNS Peasley Boise Movers cites several driving factors: Less Stressful Life The sheer volume of people, energy, and city hustle adds stress to everything. Add kids, and getting anywhere becomes far more difficult. Small towns avoid this. Lower Cost of LivingHousing, entertainment, groceries, parking - almost everything costs more in cities. Childcare alone \u00a0can be nearly as much as a mortgage payment. Paying $18 for a burger, $500 monthly for two parking spots, or $250 for a haircut/color leaves little savings room. Many millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers in their 20s and 30s aim to buy houses and start families. But this dream may be out of reach in the city, despite good incomes. The culprit? Crushing student debt. According to the Education Data Initiative, in 2021, federal student loan debt topped out at $1.57 trillion, with Gen X carrying an average of $45,095 per person and Millennials $38,877 on average. Gen Z's averages $17,388 so far. Burdened by debt, these young people can't afford the city home prices. But in small towns, they suddenly get more house and land tha",

Whereas qualitative aspects of the study were secondary data through extensive literature review, the study has found that indeed rural-urban migration has a negative impact on service delivery. The study argue that service delivery and rural-urban migration patterns need to be part of the government agenda holistically to improve service delivery and capacity of local authorities.

Demographic and economic trends in urban, suburban and rural communities Table of Contents Table of Contents Three key demographic forces have reshaped the overall U.S. population in recent years: growing racial and ethnic diversity, increasing immigration and rising numbers of older adults. But these trends are playing out differently in the nation\u2019s rural, urban and suburban communities, touching some more than others. Likewise, recent U.S. population growth also has been uneven. Urban counties have grown at roughly the overall national rate of 13% since 2000. Suburban and small metropolitan areas have grown more briskly. Rural counties have lagged, and half of them have fewer residents now than they did in 2000. According to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data, since 2000, U.S. urban and suburban populations have grown at least as much as they did over the prior decade. But the total rural population has grown less than it did in the 1990s, when rising numbers fed hope of a modest \u201crural rebound.\u201d As a result, a somewhat smaller share of Americans now live in rural counties (14% vs. 16% in 2000). More recently, the Census Bureau\u2019s population estimates for 2017 show a one-year uptick in the nation\u2019s rural population, though not enough to make up for previous declines. Analysis by demographer Kenneth M. Johnson attributed the increase to gains in rural communities on the edge of metropolitan areas, while more remote counties continued to lose population. This chapter compares three different types of communities among the nation\u2019s counties, based on a National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) classification system.

In this paper, we argue that one key to this question lies in understanding the heterogeneous effects of remote work on housing demand. Consistent with the emerging literature, we show that remote work in expensive and dense places causes less housing demand through out-migration, which helps to explain why big cities have seen declining population and relatively weaker rents and house prices. However, we show that is counterbalanced by remote work also causing a surge in household formation. Methodologically, this paper adds to the growing body of remote work literature by being the first to use actual, post-pandemic remote work rates at a granular level as an instrumental variable. At the individual level, we utilize occupation and industry fixed-effect IVs, and at local housing market level we utilize a shift-share approach. The causal effect of remote work on housing markets is consistent with OLS, suggesting modestly larger effects for both individual and housing market models. Keywords: Remote work, housing demand, household formation JEL codes: R10, R21 1 Introduction A growing body of research has documented a significant impact of remote work on where people want to live. This has generated an emerging consensus that demand for dense, high cost areas has decreased while demand for less dense, less expensive areas has increased, both within and between metro areas (Ramani and Bloom, 2021; Gupta et al., 2021; Delventhal and Parkhomenko, 2020; Brueckner et al., 2021; Liu and Su, 2021; Delventhal et al., 2022; Althoff et al., 2022; Ozimek, 2022b). However, less well understood is how these changes play out at the intensive and extensive margins of housing demand. In this analysis we expand the scope of the literature on remote work and housing markets by examining changes along these margins of demand. In addition, we ",

Born between 1981 and 1996, this generation has faced economic and social shifts that have significantly impacted their ability to purchase homes. Despite being in their prime home-buying years, many millennials find themselves struggling with obstacles that previous generations did not face to the same extent. Understanding these challenges is crucial to addressing the housing needs of millennials. Economic Hurdles One of the primary barriers to homeownership for millennials is financial instability. Many entered the workforce during the Great Recession, which affected their earning potential and career growth. Additionally, millennials carry significant student loan debt, which can hinder their ability to save for a down payment and qualify for a mortgage. The combination of these economic challenges makes it difficult for many millennials to afford a home. Rising Home Prices In many urban areas, home prices have risen significantly, outpacing wage growth. This trend has made it increasingly difficult for millennials to enter the housing market, particularly in cities where job opportunities are most abundant. As a result, many are forced to rent longer or seek homes in more affordable, less central locations, which can lead to longer commutes and reduced access to amenities. Limited Inventory and Competition The housing market has experienced a shortage of available homes in recent years, particularly in the entry-level segment. This limited inventory has intensified competition among buyers, driving up prices even further. Millennials, often competing with older, more financially established buyers, find themselves at a disadvantage, struggling to secure homes in desirable areas. Changing Lifestyle Preferences Millennials are also redefining what it means to own a home. Many prioritize experiences and flexibility over long-term co",

Millennials as First-Time Home Buyers: Challenges, Trends, and Strategies Josh Bostick, MBA The millennial generation, born between 1981 and 1996, has become a pivotal force in the housing market. As they transition into their prime home-buying years, millennials are significantly altering the real estate landscape while navigating unique challenges in their quest for homeownership. This article delves into the trends, obstacles, and strategies that characterize millennials as first-time home buyers. The Millennial Home-Buying Landscape Millennials have become the most significant home buyer group in recent years. According to the National Association of Realtors (NAR), millennials made up 38% of home buyers in 2023, surpassing baby boomers as the leading demographic in the housing market. This change highlights the increasing economic power and evolving priorities of this generation. The trend of millennial homeownership is especially pronounced among first-time buyers. In 2023, 75% of younger millennials (ages 25-33) and 44% of older millennials (ages 34-43) were entering the market as first-time home buyers. This indicates a rising desire for homeownership among millennials despite their challenges. Challenges Facing Millennial Home Buyers Affordability and Financial Constraints One of the primary challenges for millennial home buyers is affordability. Escalating home prices, stagnant wages, and significant levels of student debt have made it increasingly tough for many millennials to brea",

Homeownership is a traditional cornerstone of the American Dream, but current economic conditions make that dream an unattainable fantasy for many young adults.\u00a0 Even as inflation subsides and interest rates drop, nationwide housing shortages keep markets tight and prices historically high. Some adult Generation Zers (aged 18-27) and Millennials (aged 28-43) can rely on family generosity as others hustle to accrue savings, uncover bargains, or invest in improvable assets.

You might be a first-time homebuyer and not even realize it. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a first-time homebuyer is anyone who has not owned a home in the last three years. This definition opens up opportunities for more individuals, including those who may have previously owned a home but have been renting for a few years. HUD\u2019s Criteria for First-Time Homebuyers: Programs Offering Down Payment Assistance to First-Time Homebuyers Down payment assistance (DPA) programs are designed to help first-time homebuyers overcome the financial hurdle of saving for a down payment. These programs provide financial aid in the form of grants, low-interest loans, or forgivable loans, allowing eligible buyers to purchase a home without needing a substantial upfront payment. Many DPA programs are available at the federal, state, and local levels, each with unique requirements and benefits. Typically, down payment assistance programs are aimed at low- to moderate-income buyers, though criteria may vary. Down payment assistance can come in various forms, depending on the program and the buyer\u2019s needs: Each of these options has unique benefits and qualifying criteria, so it\u2019s essential to c",

What a first-time homebuyer needs to qualify for a home loan The most common type of home loans available are conventional loans. These are loans that are financed by the private market, rather than a government program. Some conventional loans allow for a down-payment as low as 3%. These loans usually require a minimum credit score of 620 and they charge more as your credit score falls below 740 or if your debt-to-income (DTI) level rises. And they typically won\u2019t lend to a borrower with a DTI above 50%. First-time homebuyers should also consider several government-backed loan programs for their low or no down-payment options. FHA Loan Programs The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) operates under the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The FHA single-family mortgage program provides access to safe, affordable mortgage financing for American families. FHA does not lend money to homeowners. Instead, FHA insures qualified loans made by private lending institutions. FHA will insure single-family loans with down-payments as low as 3.5% and also provides financing for condominiums and renovation loans. FHA does not require a minimum credit score and offers more flexibility when it comes to DTI ratios, but individual lenders might have their own requirements. Fees can be higher compared to conventional loans and FHA has a limit on the loan amount they will insure. VA Home Loan Guarantee Program The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Home Loan Guarantee Program is another government program that insures qualified loans made by private lending institutions.

USDA loans are guaranteed by the USDA Rural Development Guaranteed Housing Loan Program, a part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Most USDA loans are issued by partner lenders, though the department can grant them directly to qualified borrowers with incomes below a certain limit. In addition to having no down payment requirements, USDA home loans often also have lower rates than conventional mortgages because the government is taking on the risks associated with lending. This is true even when the USDA issues the loans. For example, on May 1, 2024, the government agency set the interest rate for mortgages issued directly by the USDA at 4.625%. By comparison, the average interest rate for a conventional 30-year mortgage was about 7.36% that day.

Living in a rural area isn\u2019t always as cheap as people assume. Let\u2019s start with some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis of urban vs rural living costs.

On average, households in urban areas earn $15,779 more than households in rural areas but they also spent $7,808 more than rural households. That leaves urban households have an extra $7,971 to save or invest. According to our Income Spending Simulator, over a period of 30 years, if that money were saved at rate of 5% it would add up to an additional $667,000 in net worth!

The truth is, there are positive and negative aspects to both kinds of living. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2016, the median household income in rural communities was 4% lower than that of urban communities. However, roughly 3% more families in urban areas were living under the poverty line.\u00a0 The cost of living, earnings potential, and lifestyle differences all combine to make each lifestyle different. Before you decide to buy a farm in the country or get an apartment in Manhattan, it\u2019s essential to understand the pros and cons of both lifestyles.\u00a0 Advantages of urban living While urban living does get a certain amount of negative attention for its high price tag, it also comes with opportunities and amenities that rural living cannot offer. Urban living offers more options for employment, entertainment, and transportation, and many people feel these positives far outweigh the disadvantages.\u00a0 Earnings potential According to Bloomberg, urban areas (both large and small) consistently report earnings higher than the national average. Residents can find higher-paying jobs in urban areas than in rural areas, which leads to higher net worth.\u00a0\u00a0 There is also a wider range of job opportunities for workers.

Understanding these differences is important for individuals considering where to live, work or travel. Rural areas are typically characterized by low population density, expansive natural landscapes, and a strong sense of community, often with agriculture playing a key role in the local economy. In contrast, urban areas are defined by their high population density, diverse and dense built environments, and a wide array of economic activities, including manufacturing, services, and technology sectors. This article aims to look into the nuanced distinctions between these two settings. By exploring population density, lifestyle, economic activities, infrastructure, environmental quality, and living costs, we can better appreciate the unique challenges and opportunities each presents. The goal is to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview, enabling readers to draw informed conclusions about the implications of living and working in rural versus urban areas. Population Density and Size: Contrasting Rural and Urban Realities The distinction between rural and urban areas is most starkly evident in their population density and community size. Population density refers to the number of people living per unit of area, typically measured in inhabitants per square kilometre or square mile, and it significantly influences the social dynamics, infrastructure, and resources of an area. Urban Areas: High-Density and Larger Communities Urban areas are characterized by their high population density. These regions are hubs of economic, cultural, and social activities, attracting a diverse population.

The country is growing in numbers, it\u2019s becoming more racially and ethnically diverse and the population is aging. But according to a new analysis by Pew Research Center, these trends are playing out differently across community types. Urban areas are at the leading edge of racial and ethnic change, with nonwhites now a clear majority of the population in urban counties while solid majorities in suburban and rural areas are white. Urban and suburban counties are gaining population due to an influx of immigrants in both types of counties, as well as domestic migration into suburban areas. In contrast, rural counties have made only minimal gains since 2000 as the number of people leaving for urban or suburban areas has outpaced the number moving in. And while the population is graying in all three types of communities, this is happening more rapidly in the suburbs than in urban and rural counties. \u00a0 At the same time, urban and rural communities are becoming increasingly different from each other politically. Adults in urban counties, long aligned with the Democratic Party, have moved\u00a0even more to the left in recent years, and today twice as many urban voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic as affiliate with the Republican Party. For their part, rural adults have moved more firmly into the Republican camp. More than half (54%) of rural voters now identify with or lean to the GOP, while 38% are Democrats or lean Democratic.

According to the 2015 American Community Survey, median household income for rural households was $52,386, about 4.0 percent lower than the median for urban households, $54,296. About 13.3 percent of people in rural areas lived in families with incomes below the official poverty thresholds. The poverty rate for people in urban areas was 16.0 percent.

Though often overshadowed by the affordable housing crisis in urban environments, the rural affordable housing issue is equally pressing. In this article, we\u2019ll delve deeply into the intricacies of rural affordable housing, exploring why it is a considerable and ongoing concern, and examine innovative solutions that can make a significant difference. Understanding the Rural Housing Crisis In rural areas, the affordable housing crisis is multifaceted and differs greatly from the urban context. Key factors contributing to this problem include lower incomes, limited employment opportunities, and an aging housing stock. Unlike urban settings where the proximity to resources is better, rural residents often face long distances to access essential goods and services. These transportation barriers only exacerbate the issue. Moreover, the proportion of substandard housing is higher in rural areas. Aging homes, inadequate infrastructures such as outdated sewage systems, and energy inefficiency are common challenges. These residents often live farther from health services, educational institutions, and market centers, thereby increasing their living costs in ways that urban residents may not face. Federal and state policies, designed predominantly with urban areas in mind, often overlook rural housing needs. Consequently, funding for rural development projects is significantly limited. This oversight results in fewer financial resources and limited investment in rural housing improvements, driving the cycle of poverty and housing instability. The absence of large-scale developers willing to invest in rural housing further complicates the scenario. Innovative Solutions for Rural Affordable Housing Addressing the unique challenges of affordable housing in rural settings requires out-of-the-box thinking and resilient planning. One effe",

Amid these circumstances, about half of Americans (49%) say the availability of affordable housing in their local community is a major problem, up 10 percentage points from early 2018, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October 2021. This Pew Research Center analysis about the levels of concern among Americans about the affordability of housing draws from a Center survey designed to understand Americans\u2019 views and preferences for where they live. The survey of 9,676 U.S. adults was conducted from Oct. 18 to 24, 2021.

This problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted employment and housing stability for many young people. Thus, addressing the specific housing needs of young adults is more urgent than ever.

In order to achieve this goal, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates to historic levels, reaching 20 percent in 1981. Though Volcker ultimately succeeded in reducing inflation, it had many side effects. The ensuing recession, a strong dollar, and tax reforms accelerated the transition of the U.S. economy from manufacturing to a service-based economy. Manufacturing jobs, which peaked at 19.5 million in 1979, fell to under 11.5 million during the pandemic, while employment in finance and professional and business services soared from 12 million to 32 million. This economic shift brought with it a demographic realignment, with population growth concentrating in large metros where service industries thrived.

Demographic and economic trends in urban, suburban and rural communities Table of Contents Table of Contents Three key demographic forces have reshaped the overall U.S. population in recent years: growing racial and ethnic diversity, increasing immigration and rising numbers of older adults. But these trends are playing out differently in the nation\u2019s rural, urban and suburban communities, touching some more than others. Likewise, recent U.S. population growth also has been uneven. Urban counties have grown at roughly the overall national rate of 13% since 2000. Suburban and small metropolitan areas have grown more briskly. Rural counties have lagged, and half of them have fewer residents now than they did in 2000. According to a Pew Research Center analysis of census data, since 2000, U.S. urban and suburban populations have grown at least as much as they did over the prior decade. But the total rural population has grown less than it did in the 1990s, when rising numbers fed hope of a modest \u201crural rebound.\u201d As a result, a somewhat smaller share of Americans now live in rural counties (14% vs. 16% in 2000). More recently, the Census Bureau\u2019s population estimates for 2017 show a one-year uptick in the nation\u2019s rural population, though not enough to make up for previous declines. Analysis by demographer Kenneth M. Johnson attributed the increase to gains in rural communities on the edge of metropolitan areas, while more remote counties continued to lose population.

Rural Employment and Unemployment Note: The terms \"nonmetropolitan\" (nonmetro) and \"rural\" are used interchangeably, as are \"metropolitan\" (metro) and \"urban.\" References to metro and nonmetro areas reflect either the 2003 or the 2013 definition of metropolitan counties, as determined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, as indicated.\u00a0 This topic page examines employment and labor force trends in rural and urban areas from 2007 to 2022, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Three indicators are tracked: employment levels (number of people employed), labor force participation rates (the share of the civilian noninstitutionalized population that is working or actively looking for work), and prime-working-age unemployment rates (the share of the labor force age 25\u201354 that is unemployed). The time period covers the Great Recession (2007\u201309), the ensuing economic recovery (2010\u201319), and the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing economic recovery (2020\u201322). Employment and labor force impacts varied by metropolitan status, age group, and race/ethnicity\u2014revealing the uneven impacts of economic recession and recovery across the rural and urban United States. Employment Levels After nonmetro areas lost 1.4 million jobs between 2007 and 2010, nonmetro employment grew slowly and by 2019 had returned to 97 percent (20.4 million employed) of pre-Great Recession employment levels (21.0 million employed in 2007). The slow-employment-growth period from 2010 to 2019 partially coincided with the first ever period of overall nonmetropolitan population decline between 2010 and 2016 (see Rural America at a Glance, 2019 Edition).

They have unique perspectives on local issues, they often bring new ideas to the table, and they can be an inexhaustible source of energy and passion for social change. For Democracy Young people have a massive stake in the decisions that shape the country. Nearly all issues affect youth, and many affect youth differently or uniquely: education, healthcare, the environment, immigration, housing, gun violence, and foreign policy that may send them or their peers to war. When young people vote and participate in civic life, they can bring valuable perspectives to these issues and play an active role in shaping their future. If youth are excluded or do not participate, our democracy is not truly representing all people and not meeting its full potential. For Communities Youth are integral to their local communities: they help shape its culture and they have extensive social connections. Just as young people experience a community's problems firsthand, they are often on the front lines of activism and other efforts to help address them. Communities are stro",

But despite this hopeful attitude, youth engagement in everything from national elections to community life varies and vacillates. After turning out to vote at record rates in 2020, initial estimates indicate that nearly 60% of young voters opted not to vote in 2024. The 2024 election may have seen the third-lowest youth turnout for a presidential race in 50 years. Disconnection and loneliness contribute to these trends. Although young people believe they have power, they also seem to feel less connected to their communities and other people. According to U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, the rate of loneliness among young adults has increased every year between 1976 and 2019, and young adults have some of the highest rates of loneliness of any age group. Further, in recent decades, young people have had limited opportunities to engage in community life in meaningful ways. Many community initiatives and programs have viewed young people only as recipients of services, denying teens and young adults, particularly young people of color, the opportunity to make valuable contributions or represent their interests. But when young people engage with their communities in ways that matter to them, the benefits are compelling, ranging from a stronger sense of belonging and lower rates of depression to lower levels of criminal behavior and substance use.

Hope (Brennan Center post) Civic engagement is a key indicator of adulthood. Young adults respond to the social and political issues of the day in a variety of ways. After the police killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor in 2020, young people demonstrated against racial injustice in more than 10,000 peaceful protests around the country. footnote1_1cttqp21 That fall saw record numbers of youth turn out for the presidential election; half of eligible voters ages 18\u201329 participated, compared with 39 percent in 2016. footnote2_0wwu9tw2 Climate change likewise catalyzed young people, as nearly 30 percent of Generation Z and Millennials made donations, contacted public officials, volunteered, or protested, surpassing Generation X and Baby Boomers. footnote3_pokoojm3 Young people are commonly assumed to be disengaged, disillusioned, and uninterested in civic life. These trends challenge that proposition. Researchers have consistently found that early civic engagement is mutually beneficial to young people and to the communities in which they participate. For example, developmental psychologist Parissa Ballard and colleagues found that early civic engagement is associated with positive health outcomes later in life. Voting, volunteering, and activism in young adulthood were related to improved mental health, greater educational attainment, and higher personal and household incomes. footnote4_2nmucl14Beyond these individual benefits, young adults are important contributors to their local communities. Tufts University\u2019s Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) projected that in the 2020 election cycle, young adults would play a particularly important role in the presidential battleground states Wisconsin, North Carolina, and Florida, as well as in Senate races in Colorado, Maine, and Montana and congressional races in Iowa\u2019s 1st District, Maine\u2019s 2nd, and Georgia\u2019s 7th. footnote5_394lp2u5 The youth v",

Young people, however, may view their representation as an outcome of empowerment according to the cultural context of their society. Youth organisations\u2019 representation and engagement in grassroots activities can help promote young people\u2019s contribution to decision-making processes and give them a platform to decide on changes to their society. This empowerment can be viewed through lenses of security, transformative change and participation (Porter, 2013). This can be understood as a form of \u201cparticipatory democracy,\u201d as defined by Hilmer (2010) and Aragones and S\u00e1nchez\u00adPag\u00e9s (2009). Is youth civil society organisation (CSOs) activism, however, considered a form of grassroots engagement and a process of \u201cparticipatory democracy\u201d in responding to the lack of a democratic process in a conflict zone or under a repressive regime? Activism promotes civic participation, freedom of expression and strengthening the basis for civil society dialogue and democratic discourse, with particular emphasis on the role of activists in a media environment (Spurk, 2010, pp. 3\u201329).

In the second discussion of the day, journalist Lydia Denworth spoke with Veronica Terriquez, PhD, MEd, a professor at UCLA; Jose Salvador Orellana, the Executive Director and Co-founder of LOUD for Tomorrow; and Jessa Bayudan, a volunteer and alumni of LOUD for Tomorrow, about the importance of creating spaces for diverse communities where adolescents feel they belong and are empowered to become agents of change. To start the conversation, Veronica Terriquez highlighted the challenges for young people in the United States, including tremendous inequality and various levels of stress and sometimes trauma, particularly among low-income youth of color. \u201cBut within these challenging contexts, there are opportunities to engage in very powerful civic engagement, and develop a sense of belonging that really transforms their own lives and their communities,\u201d she said. In Veronica\u2019s research, she examines how we can effectively build scaffolding around young people that supports their sense of belonging within their communities, which can have benefits on well-being lasting into adulthood. \u201cIn following organizations across California, I have realized that some provide really comprehensive supports that enable young people to be leaders, to become civically engaged in ways that have positive impacts,\u201d she said.

Part of this stems from the fact that we live in a country in which civic participation is low, youth civic participation is lower, and the voices that are most excluded are those from communities that are, and historically have been, underserved including low income communities, rural communities, and communities of color. These communities, which have had disproportionately little access to well-resourced schools, government services, and community services, engage at lower rates than high income, urban and suburban, and white communities. These realities point to a society that perpetuates historical political and economic inequities. There are many reasons and root causes for this historical political inequality ranging from systemic and structural barriers to participation, to discrepancies in access to and quality of youth civics education, and beyond. A principle cause is our collective inability to ensure that young voices, and especially those from underserved communities, are adequately represented in the political system.

Because this lack of trust is also on the rise, now more than ever, it is important for local government leaders to encourage civic engagement. A more engaged citizenry will yield positive benefits such as greater public trust and transparency, better decision-making, economic advantages as well as improved public services and policies. Communities are also more likely to be united around common goals when citizens are fully engaged. Civic engagement presents opportunities for communities to address social challenges that are specific to their communities with the goal of transforming them. As private citizens, people have the option to become part of the social fabric of their community or merely be spectators who sit on the sidelines. Municipalities need to take a proactive approach in actively engaging their citizens. To simply hope that every citizen will care and participate is not enough. Fortunately, there are many steps, through formal and informal channels, that local leaders can take to solicit engagement. These may include: As well as using technology to support inclusivity and engagement, it\u2019s useful to look at the programs and initiatives peers are running in their communities. 7 examples of strong civic engagement With some out-of-the-box thinking and person power, local governments can create various programs to build engagement within their communities.

Teenagers are more likely to build positive impressions of their hometowns when they feel they contribute to community efforts and are being taken seriously. But what about the youngest residents?

Local governments can tap into these channels to share important information, raise awareness about local issues, and gather input from youth. 2.

Share Republish Americans are aware that the ongoing vitality of their towns depends on keeping or attracting young people to live and work there, as Deb Fallows has written here. Young adults will stay or return to towns when they see opportunity, lifestyle amenities, affordability, and other familiar attributes. Teenagers are more likely to build positive impressions of their hometowns when they feel they contribute to community efforts and are being taken seriously. But what about the youngest residents? What does it mean when a town tries to encourage its grade schoolers to be active participants where they live? Is it too early to be thinking about that for 5-year-olds? Getting the tiniest of citizens plugged in early isn\u2019t new. Our Towns has written about examples of how communities are doing this here, here, and here.\u00a0 Here are more examples of how communities are introducing civic activities to their young children.

According to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, youth populations (aged 10-19) account for nearly 13% of the U.S. population, or 42 million individuals, as of 2019. The U.S. Census projects this number to increase significantly over the next 30-40 years. This represents a significant group that has largely been ignored until quite recently regarding leadership and participation in community projects and programs. This article will discuss ways in which we can distinguish between youth and adult leadership and provide strategies for how to empower and develop youth leaders in our communities. Youth Leadership v. Adult Leadership Youth and adult leaders are different. Multiple studies (e.g., McElravy & Hastings, 2014; Redmond & Dolan, 2016) have highlighted the differences between youth and adult leaders. Redmond and Dolan (2016) suggest that youth leadership \"focuses on the methods by which leadership can be explored, taught or experienced by young people.\" (p. 262). By contrast, adult leadership is described as being \"learned in the context of practicing leadership.\" (p. 262). McElravy and Hastings (2014) examined the links between personality, emotional intelligence, and self-leadership skills in youth, finding that personality is not a strong predictor of self-leadership skills, contrasting literature studying adults. Emotional intelligence was a strong predictor of self-leadership skills in youth, matching studies involving adults. The study's results suggest that only a few individual characteristics translate to self-leadership ability in both youth and adults, and we need to consider this in youth leadership development. \u00a0 Youth Leadership in the Community Eubanks Owens et al.

Pathways to Supporting Youth Leaders in the Community Photo Credit: Brooke Cagle on Unsplash on 6 April 2023 Youth Leadership Introduction Youth aged 15-25 are the largest and fastest-growing population worldwide and want to be included in the processes and decisions that affect the future of their community (Malcolm et al., 2020). An active community youth can bring support and buy-in from others, engaging more community members. Youth leadership programs and dedicated adult supporters can create opportunities for impactful work in the community (Augsberger et al., 2019). The key for youth leaders in community programs is buy-in from local authorities, the relationships created (both peer and mentors), and the trust in their voices to be heard to identify local issues and propose solutions. \u00a0Augsberger et al. (2019) recommend including youth leaders in local decision-making processes, directing local budgets, identifying solutions for community challenges, and aiding in disaster and emergency response. The authors listed several benefits of supporting youth leaders in the community: Youth Leaders in Action Community Governance Foundation funding was crucial in equipping youth leadership programs in New Jersey with resources to encourage youths aged 14-21 to address health equity concerns in their community (Atkins et al., 2020). The Next Generation Community Leaders program is an initiative that provided funding to ten youth-serving organizations that hosted community-based youth projects that provided 11 months of training and mentoring and four weeks of project delivery over the summer. Each project had funding, including summer pay for youth, mentors, project development assistance, and community assets. From the first group of youth projects in the community, youths were able to address community challenges such as school absenteeism and improved food security for older adults ",

Goals include the following: 1. Increase participants\u2019 understanding of the concept of leadership and how the concept is culturally-based; 2. Increase participants\u2019 understanding of and appreciation for cultural diversity; 3. Assist participants in developing specific skills needed for effective leadership; 4.

Increase participants\u2019 awareness of themselves and how they relate to others; and 6. Provide opportunities for participants to apply the knowledge, skills, and understandings through meaningful services to the community. Program Values and Assumptions Excellent programs must be based on clearly articulated values and a philosophy which reflects those values. This model is based on valuing and promoting growth and learning, collaboration, inclusivity, diversity, openness, creativity , flexibility, innovation, and harmony. It also uses a systems approach which defines leadership as a complex system involving the skills, abilities, and knowledge of the \u201cleader\u201d, the skills, abilities, and knowledge of the \u201cfollowers\u201d and the context in which all interact.

Learn how community members benefit from leadership programs. All communities have individuals who take on leadership roles to further community causes and create change. These leaders have desire, spirit and an unyielding aspiration to make their communities better places to live and work for generations to come. When you think of a leader, you might initially think of a Fortune 500 CEO, however there are many types of leaders. Within our own communities, leaders can be visible or silent. Leaders cannot be identified by any one criterion. When seeking new leaders in the community, one must look at all demographics. If prepared and trained leaders are not readily available, communities should make an effort to help create local leaders. A research study by Ben Winchester, Extension research fellow of the University of Minnesota, explains that, \u201cOrganizations in the most rural counties [of Minnesota] require an average of one in 34 residents to serve in leadership positions, compared with one leader required for every 143 residents of major metropolitan areas. So, the demand for leadership is up to five times more in rural counties than in urban areas, while the supply of leaders is diminishing.\u201d How can rural areas, regardless of location, attract leaders to elected positions and civic organizations when there are simply fewer individuals? One way is to create their own. Stop depending on the same individuals that groups call on, and enhance youth leadership education, mentorship and explore those untapped community members. Retaining young people who will live, work and raise their families in their home communities are critical. Leadership development programs should be offered to local students who may indeed stay in rural communities or surrounding areas. In addition, pote",

Hirschman published\u00a0Exit, Voice, and Loyalty:\u00a0 Responses to Decline in Firms, Organizations, and States.\u00a0 In it, Hirschman outlines what he sees as three options available to individuals ensnared in a negative or oppressive circumstance, such as feeling trapped in an unproductive job, belonging to a group that has strayed from its original principles, or living in a repressive society.\u00a0 People can \u201cexit,\u201d that is, escape or move on without caring about the \u201cfate of the communities whence they came.\u201d\u00a0 They can show \u201cloyalty,\u201d or do nothing and uphold the status quo of the situation and bear the consequences.\u00a0 Or, more optimistically, people can use their \u201cvoice\u201d and work within their circumstances to make a positive and lasting change for the better. \u00a0Cynthia M.

Programs that are developed in partnership with youth are more likely to be effective at engaging the population and, therefore, to have a greater impact. Involving youth as partners in making decisions that affect them increases the likelihood that the decisions will be accepted, adopted, and become part of their everyday lives. In addition, empowering youth to identify and respond to community needs helps them become empathetic, reflective individuals, setting them on a course to potentially continue this important work in their future. Meaningful youth engagement views youth as equal partners with adults in the decision-making process. Programs and activities are developed with youth, rather than for youth. In this kind of equal partnership, both adults and young people need to be fully engaged, open to change in how things are done, and share a unified vision for the partnership. Considerations for organizations that want to involve youth in a meaningful way Here are some suggested steps to consider when trying to engage young people and ensure the experience is meaningful for the youth as well as for the program. Assess Consider where your program currently is on the continuum of youth engagement and where you would like to be. Not every program or activity can or should always involve youth at Level 5. Youth\u2019s level of involvement may vary based on the capacity of program staff to spend time and resources on involving youth, the purpose of involving youth, and support within the organization for involving youth. Organizational infrastructure and support for involving youth are key concerns for sustainability of youth involvement.

It draws on research with young people taking action on climate change in order to explore these concepts. Young people around the world are expressing frustration at opportunities to participate in democracy that give them a voice but little or no effective power. The current wave of direct action and participation in democracy, including protest actions like the worldwide school strikes for action on climate change and the prominence of young people as they raise voices for change around the world, presents an opportunity for others to act in young people\u2019s support. The chapter offers a conceptual model for those who wish to support young people to have an effective voice in democracy. The model is called the PASS model, comprising Positions, Allies, Solidarities, and Spaces. The PASS model is described, and the entry reflects on ways that young people can be supported in democracy. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

Their engagement in the electoral process is crucial for addressing the issues that matter most to them and ensuring their voices are heard. The power of youth voting Young people today are at the forefront of a transformative movement in American politics. With their unique perspectives and experiences, they are redefining what it means to be politically active. The 2024 election presents a significant opportunity for these young leaders to advocate for their rights and the changes they wish to see in society. Key issues for young voters What are the pressing issues that resonate with young voters? Here are some of the key topics: Climate change: Young voters are increasingly concerned about environmental issues and are advocating for policies that promote sustainability and combat climate change. Social justice: Issues related to racial equality, police reform, and systemic injustice are at the forefront of young voters\u2019 minds, driving them to demand change. Education: Access to affordable education and student debt relief are critical issues that young people are passionate about, as they seek to secure a better future.

Less Civic Support for Rural Youth Rural and urban youth are getting similar levels of civic information, but rural youth lack the support to take action on it.\u00a0 Potential in Associations Rural youth belong to groups at similar rates to urban youth, but less than 1 in 5 have opportunities to use their voice in groups. The urban/rural divide is one of several inequities that affect youth civic engagement and often result in unequal outcomes, such as voting rates, that keep rural youth underrepresented in civic life. These inequities are often about access to information and opportunities, especially in communities that are more likely to be civic deserts. However, even when there is relatively equal civic access, the barriers faced by rural youth can run deeper, particularly as it relates to the quality and ultimate perception of such opportunities. A new analysis, based on CIRCLE\u2019s Pre-2024 Election Youth Survey of 18-to-34-year-olds, underscores these dynamics. We generally find similar levels of access and exposure to civic learning and engagement between rural and urban youth based on the limited measures we asked about, but significant gaps in support and civic culture.

The good news is that there are practical and effective ways to engage this vital demographic\u2014especially through digital platforms and tools that resonate with them. Here are some strategies to bridge the gap and ensure that youth actively participate in local governance. 1. Leverage Social Media for Civic Engagement Social media is an essential tool for reaching younger demographics. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Twitter allow youth to spend significant time sharing opinions and engaging with current events. Local governments can tap into these channels to share important information, raise awareness about local issues, and gather input from youth. Create Targeted Content: Tailor posts to highlight how local decisions impact young people's daily lives. Use language that resonates with them, avoid overly formal tones, and include visuals like short videos or infographics to make the content more engaging. Interactive Features: Utilize polls, Q&A sessions, or live streams where local officials address questions directly from young residents.

Introduction As we navigate an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the importance of civic education in schools cannot be overstated. It is through civic education that we equip our youth with the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to become responsible and engaged citizens. By fostering a sense of civic duty and empowering students to actively participate in their communities, schools play a vital role in shaping the future of our societies. Civic education goes beyond traditional academic subjects. It encompasses the teaching of democratic principles, social responsibility, and active citizenship. In an era where civic participation and informed decision-making are crucial, schools serve as the ideal setting to instill these values in our young learners. By equipping them with civic knowledge, critical thinking abilities, and a sense of ethical responsibility, schools prepare students to contribute meaningfully to society. By providing opportunities for students to interact with professionals from various fields, including professional letter writers from https://essayswriters.com/personal-letter-writer.html, schools can further enhance students' understanding of civic engagement and empower them to make a positive impact on society through their words and actions. Understanding Civic Education Civic education encompasses the teaching and learning of democratic principles, civic values, and participatory skills. Its objectives include developing informed citizens, promoting civic participation, and nurturing a sense of social responsibility. By engaging students in civic education, schools cultivate a foundation for a democratic society and empower young individuals to become active contributors.

The present study evaluates a theoretical model linking perceived democratic school climate with adolescent civic engagement (operationalized as civic responsibility and intentions for future participation), taking into account the mediating role of civic discussions and perceived fairness at school. Participants were 403 adolescents (47.9 % male) ranging in age from 11 to 15 years old (mean age = 13.6). Path analysis results partially validated the proposed theoretical model. Higher levels of democratic school climate were associated with higher levels of adolescent civic responsibility; the association was fully mediated by civic discussions and perceived fairness at school.

But no one tells you everyone has these dreams\u2014suburbanites, city dwellers, and small-town folk all hope to escape their lot and do something different.\u00a0 I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago, and even there, I longed to escape in pursuit of adventure elsewhere. I believe many people share this desire regardless of where they\u2019re from. It\u2019s not about escaping the small town; it\u2019s about leaving the nest and setting out on your own. Sometimes, that means running to a small town instead of away from it.\u00a0 The Benefits of Living in a Small Town No one ever talks about how refreshing small-town life can be.\u00a0 I\u2019m a city girl. As I said, I grew up in Chicago\u2019s suburbs and then lived in Los Angeles for the first ten years of my adult life. Next, I moved to the small city of Savannah, and from there, I moved to a tiny little town in rural (ish) Pennsylvania.\u00a0 Although it\u2019s not perfect, living in a small town has its benefits.\u00a0 Affordability I moved to a small town to save money. I wanted to find a place with a low cost of living so I could achieve my financial goals.\u00a0 When a great job opportunity opened up in rural Pennsylvania, I jumped on it. Home prices in there average $100k. I bought a fixer-upper for half of that.\u00a0 I purchased the home with cash and eliminated a mortgage payment from my budget.\u00a0 Of course, most people can\u2019t afford to drop 50K on a home, but a 100K mortgage is more manageable than a mortgage or even rent in larger cities. Walkable Everything I need is only a few blocks away. I can walk to the small grocery store, post office, the local bar, a pizza place, and a Chinese take-out joint. If I didn\u2019t have to work, I wouldn\u2019t need a car at all.\u00a0 The resources ne",

My story is the opposite even though I started out as one of those starry-eyed students destined for big adventures in the city. My hometown has less than 17,000 people. We have one Starbucks, no shopping mall and Kmart instead of Wal-Mart or Target. Despite its small size, I didn\u2019t feel trapped or limited in opportunities growing up. I participated in school plays, choir, track, tennis and competitive dance. I attended cooking classes and movie nights hosted by the recreation and park district. When I graduated from high school, I admit I was ready to leave. I wanted to move on to bigger things, whatever those might be. I spent four years attending college in Los Angeles County and one semester in Washington, D.C. I got my taste of big-city life, but I can\u2019t say the quality of life was any better. Here are 20 benefits of living in a small town as a 20-something. 1. Shorter commutes and less time stuck in traffic. It takes only seven minutes to drive from one end of my town to the other, which is how long my commute is to work. That means I can go home on my lunch hour and see my husband if he\u2019s home. 2. Smaller churches = more intimacy. There might not be as many ministry opportunities or small groups, but there\u2019s a greater chance of knowing the majority of people who join you in worship every week. 3. Cross-church community. Churches in my town get together every so often for \u201cFifth Sunday Sings.\u201d It\u2019s a worship night hosted by a different church every time, and all church goers are invited to participate 4.

While there are many practical factors that weigh in this decision, such as cost of living, quality of life, and economic opportunity, there's also a more deeply rooted motivation for many. In 2018, 80% of American\u2019s lived in urban areas, but a Gallup Poll reported by The Washington Post\u00a0showed that only 12% of Americans preferred urban life. A staggering 39% of those surveyed said that they would prefer to live in a rural environment or small town.

City dwellers can use strategies to find balance and flourish in sometimes stressful urban environments. Cities are centers of opportunity, diversity, and innovation. They provide amenities, core services, and social benefits, which can often make them more attractive than suburban or rural areas. However, they may also present challenges that can profoundly affect mental well-being. For instance, some common aspects of urban life include noise pollution, social inequalities, and feelings of social isolation. The rapid, sometimes chaotic pace of cities can also cause stress and anxiety. This article explains the link between city life and mental health, highlights key concerns, and provides strategies for thriving. Does city living affect mental health? The overall relationship between city living and mental health is complex, but extensive research links urban environments to reduced mental health. However, the effect differs significantly due to individual factors like genetic predisposition, socioeconomic status, and the strength of social support networks. Specific features of an urban region can also influence its effects on mental well-being, including size, population density, and pollution levels. Additionally, the economic status of a country plays a role. A 2020 research review showed a connection between urbanization and mental health concerns, with urban environments linking to higher rates of mental health challenges. Social, economic, and environmental factors natural to urban life can influence mental health. On the other hand, cities offer a wide range of resources that can support mental health.

At first glance, trading green fields for gray grids would seem to be a trade up. City slickers have, on average, more money, better food and greater access to health care than country folk. On the flip side, though, recent studies indicate that memory and attention can suffer in urban environments, and psychologists have long known that city life takes an emotional toll. Urbanites are more likely to suffer from anxiety and depression, and the risk of schizophrenia increases dramatically among people raised in a city. Some researchers have calculated that children born in cities face twice, if not three times, the risk of developing a serious emotional disorder as compared with their rural and suburban peers. These statistics may not surprise harried rush-hour commuters, but they are also not easily explained. Epidemiologists have ruled out the most obvious answers\u2014namely, that people at risk for developing emotional disorders are more drawn to urban areas.

We have seen a nationwide push from all sectors of industry toward this ambiguous \u201cbigger\u201d that is supposedly synonymous with \u201cbetter.\u201d But is bigger really better? Costs and benefits aside, this question affects our day-to-day lives in very tangible ways, beginning with the places we call home. The fact that cities are growing is undeniable. According to the United Nations (UN) Department of Economic and Social Affairs, the urban global population has soared from 751 million in 1950 to 4.2 billion today. This accounts for 55 percent of the world\u2019s population, which the UN projects will rise to 68 percent by 2050. In other words, more and more people are moving from small towns\u2014which are often the places that their family has called home for generations\u2014to large, urban cities. This phenomenon is not anything new; we saw a similar pattern of movement during the Industrial Revolution of the nineteenth century and the DotCom boom of the twentieth century. The continued shift to bigger cities is easy enough to understand: many are pursuing opportunities\u2014professional and social\u2014that they believe are uniquely available in urban areas. For some, moving to a city is an exciting chance to live in someplace new, a place different from their hometown. For others, it\u2019s a begrudging change they feel obligated or even forced to make because of professional or personal obligation. This latter group would most likely prefer to stay in the small community they call home if it were only feasible, which begs the question, what if it was?

Executive Summary The COVID-19 pandemic forced Americans across the country to reconsider their community preferences. Today, many Americans would prefer to live in small towns or rural areas rather than denser urban neighborhoods, and they are more likely to prioritize personal space over access to community amenities. When it comes to rating their communities, White Americans are more positive about their neighborhoods than are Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans. But White Americans are also less optimistic about the future of their communities than other groups are. Forty-three percent of Asian Americans, 42 percent of Black Americans, and 39 percent of Hispanic Americans say their communities will get better in the near future, compared to 30 percent of White Americans. Many Americans live close to at least some local amenities. Close proximity to amenities such as caf\u00e9s and parks increases neighborliness, feelings of safety, social trust, and positive feelings about the community. For Americans living in urban and suburban areas, greater amenity access is linked to higher levels of trust. More than three-quarters of high-amenity urbanites (76 percent) and sub",

Introduction: Communities and American Ideals Public conversation about the future of communities is often dominated by debates about talent attraction, urban-versus-suburban development priorities, access and affordability. But any attempt to envision America\u2019s communities of the future needs to expand beyond these narrow objectives and begin with the more fundamental ideals that unite and ground American society. Communities that hope to flourish need to allow their residents to achieve the American Dream of upward mobility. They should also enable the expression of self determination, unity amid diversity and strong familial and communal life.\u00a0 More than abstractions, these ideals have practical consequences. For most, the American experiment is first experienced in the communities where they live, and their reasons for moving to, or staying within a community often have to do with how diversified and\u00a0robust the overall experience of opportunity is. The ideal community, I will argue, is both competitive and desirable. It capitalizes on its distinctive qualities to compete with other communities for people, investment, and jobs, and it also offers a level of life satisfaction that makes its residents think twice before leaving. Most importantly, it caters to diversity of preferences and allows for individual realization\u00a0of aspiration. First, as knowledge-intensive enterprises continue to drive economic growth, thriving communities need to find ways to attract and retain ",

While individual factors of an urban environment have been investigated in isolation, no attempt has been made to model how complex, real-life exposure to living in the city relates to brain and mental health, and how this is moderated by genetic factors. Using the data of 156,075 participants from the UK Biobank, we carried out sparse canonical correlation analyses to investigate the relationships between urban environments and psychiatric symptoms. We found an environmental profile of social deprivation, air pollution, street network and urban land-use density that was positively correlated with an affective symptom group (r\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.22, Pperm\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001), mediated by brain volume differences consistent with reward processing, and moderated by genes enriched for stress response, including CRHR1, explaining 2.01% of the variance in brain volume differences. Protective factors such as greenness and generous destination accessibility were negatively correlated with an anxiety symptom group (r\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.10, Pperm\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001), mediated by brain regions necessary for emotion regulation and moderated by EXD3, explaining 1.65% of the variance. The third urban environmental profile was correlated with an emotional instability symptom group (r\u00e2\u20ac\u2030=\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.03, Pperm\u00e2\u20ac\u2030<\u00e2\u20ac\u20300.001).

Seventy-one New Urbanists, including many of the movement\u2019s leading lights, gathered in Washington recently to address a set of increasingly urgent questions: If density is good for a city, how much of it should there be? How tall should the buildings rise? What forms should they take?\u00a0 Everyone attending the March 31-April 2 event hosted by CNU\u2019s District of Columbia chapter seemed to agree that not all density is good. Architect and chapter president Dhiru Thadani opened the Council\u2014on \u201cDensity Without Urbanism/Urbanism Without Density\u201d\u2014by showing rows of high-rise apartment buildings stretching seemingly endlessly across China. \u201cPeople are\u00a0just being\u00a0warehoused\u00a0in large buildings,\u201d he reflected.

Generally, the buildings lack architectural distinction. The exterior is frequently divided into many vertical segments, sometimes in contrasting materials or colors, in an attempt to make whole thing look less bulky and overwhelming. This fragmented esthetic dismays many city-lovers.

Big cities traditionally contain diverse populations and access to museums and research institutions, but parents might worry about gangs or kids growing up too fast. Small towns have a reputation for strong communities and access to the outdoors, but cause parents concern over limited resources or teen boredom. The reality is that statistics paint conflicting pictures of teen life in both places. The difference between teenagers in big cities and small towns may matter less than the challenges your teen will encounter based on her own individual experiences and choices. Recent History Current studies don\u2019t paint as clear-cut a picture, however. A more pervasive media or online culture could affect this blending, or metropolitan systems may have become more integrated, creating more opportunities for teen experiences to cross over. During the 1990s, risk-taking among teenagers decreased across the board, according to the nonpartisan Urban Institute 4. Birth Rate Raising Kids in the City vs. the Suburbs Learn More The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that in 2011, the live birth rate for teens age 15 to 19 was 31.3 for every 1,000 women (representing an 8 percent drop from 2010). Environmental characteristics surrounding teen mothers include high poverty, poor schools, poor housing and limited health resources -- factors that could take place in big cities or small towns. Overall, though, in 2010 the teen birth rate was higher in rural areas compared to urban areas by about one-third, according to The National Campaign To Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.

That\u2019s why, over the years, more and more people begin to consider moving to a smaller town. But is that really what you want?

This means that when an individual chooses to live in either a big city or a small city, he/she foregoes certain advantages, while at the same time attaining others. Small cities are characterized by a scarce population and a relatively simple life. On the contrary, life in big cities is typified by commotions and impersonal relationships. All over the globe, there are big cities and small cities. According to Fischer those who prefer big cities do so because of the facilities that are found in these cities (179). The purpose of this paper is to compare and contrast big cities and small cities. One of the obvious similarities between big cities and small cities is that both have amenities like electricity, good roads, and running water. These amenities make individuals have similar experiences regardless of whether they live in a big or a small city. In addition, these amenities are the main factor that differentiates small and big cities from rural areas. Another key similarity between small and big cities according to Fischer is that both of them have streets, which residents use to locate their homes (80). Cities, whether big or small, normally have a population occupying them; a factor that enables residents to have a normal life. Another major similarity between big cities and small cities is that both of them have a relatively large concentration of facilities such as hospitals and schools. This provides city residents with a wide variety of choices when it comes to treatment and education. Both big cities and small cities have recreational facilities like entertainment venues, parks, and art centers like museums (Fischer 82-90). Lastly, the public transport system is a common feature in both big and small cities. One of the main differences between big cities and small cities can be seen in terms of the cost of living.

The nationally representative survey of 13-to 40-year-olds explores the social dynamics of teens and young adults and highlights how online communications platforms \u2013 and certain specific features within them \u2013 play a significant role in their relationships with close friends and family. Teens and young adults use a wide variety of features associated with online communication platforms, and features that connect them to family and friends are the most likely to bring them happiness. Three in five (62%) say they feel happy directly messaging with family and close friends while far fewer feel happy scrolling through their feed (38%), looking at content produced by celebrities or influencers (30%), or following the news through their timeline or feed (25%).

Our understanding of how it can be best addressed is limited. This systematic review aims to assess the acceptability and effectiveness of interventions to reduce and prevent loneliness and social isolation in young people. Methods: Six bibliographic databases were searched; references of included studies were screened for relevant literature. A pre-defined framework was used for data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Data were synthesised narratively. Results: 9,358 unique references were identified; 28 publications from 16 interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions were high intensity, individual or small group interventions, often targeted at specific 'at risk' populations. While 14 interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in loneliness or social isolation, the heterogeneous measures of loneliness, small sample sizes, short periods of follow-up and high attrition rates limit evidence on ef",

Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately half of people in the US reported experiencing measurable levels of loneliness. Despite localized and select cross-sectional studies highlighting even higher increases in isolation/loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional research is needed, particularly for youth and young adults. This work examines patterns of isolation/loneliness across the US from 2016 to 2022 among individuals aged 24 and younger. Our study leverages a unique dataset, Crisis Text Line, which provides complete spatiotemporal coverage of crisis conversations in the US. We conducted a geospatial analysis using Kuldroff\u2019s Space\u2013Time SatScan to identify statistically significant clustering of elevated isolation/loneliness-related conversations. The statistical significance of spatiotemporal clusters was determined using Monte Carlo simulations (n\u2009=\u20099999). Results demonstrated local relative risk as high as 1.47 in high-risk populations in Southern, Midwest, and Atlantic states, indicating areas where the actual case count is 147% of the expected cases (p value\u2009<\u20090.01) from May to July 2020. Results also identified co-occurrence of isolation/loneliness and other crises concerns, including depression/sadness, anxiety, and multiple suicidality indicators, with higher rates among racial/ethnic minority, transgender and gender diverse, and younger individuals. This work makes a unique contribution to the literature by elucidating spatiotemporal disparities in isolation/loneliness among young people, providing much-needed knowledge as to where future public health interventions are immediately needed.

E-mail: Kara.Takasaki@utexas.edu. Abstract This article investigates the meaning of friendship during the transition to adulthood. In depth interviews were conducted with a small sample of primarily white young adults from middle-class backgrounds. Friendship was a source of support for respondents during relationship, education, and residential transitions. Respondents described how friendship externally supported marriage and family relationships and could develop into a distinct relationship bond within marriage and family relationships. Respondents experienced instability in their personal communities and pursued friendship for its individualized social support and value in addition to marriage and family relationships. Respondents\u2019 descriptions of friendship in their personal communities reflected a culture of individualism, which helped them to develop adult, middle-class identities. Keywords: friendship; transition to adulthood; culture; personal communities Ann Swidler\u2019s (2001) Talk of Love: How Culture Matters challenges cultural sociologists to find out what elements of a cultural schema enable it to control and organize other cultural elements. Swidler considers the explanation that public cultures, consisting of particular beliefs authorized by society, organize action in periods of instability. Swidler also argues that in the dearth of formal institutions, contracts, and government regulation, Americans believe that the voluntary choices of individuals organize acti",

Abstract Humans are social animals and the interpersonal bonds formed between them are crucial for their development and well being in a society. These relationships are usually structured into several layers (Dunbar\u2019s layers of friendship) depending on their significance in an individual\u2019s life with closest friends and family being the most important ones taking major part of their time and communication effort. However, we have little idea how the initiation and termination of these relationships occurs across the lifespan. Mobile phones, in particular, have been used extensively to shed light on the dif",

Likewise, friendships also retroact on personality and thus contribute to the dynamic codevelopment of individuals and their social environments over the life span. The chapter draws on theories of friendship and friendship development and refers to recent empirical work testing these theoretical accounts. It suggests future studies can contribute to understanding friendships by applying a network approach and taking other relationships into account.

Increasing urbanization over the next three decades will be accompanied by a growing population of children and adolescents living in cities3. Shaping the aspects of urban life that influence youth mental health could have an enormous impact on adolescent well-being and adult trajectories4. We invited a multidisciplinary, global group of researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people to complete sequential surveys to identify and prioritize the characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for young people. Here we show a set of ranked characteristic statements, grouped by personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental domains of intervention. Life skills for personal development, valuing and accepting young people\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s ideas and choices, providing safe public space for social connection, employment and job security, centring youth input in urban planning and design, and addressing adverse social determinants were priorities by domain. We report the adversities that COVID-19 generated and link relevant actions to these data. Our findings highlight the need for intersectoral, multilevel intervention and for inclusive, equitable, participatory design of cities that support youth mental health.

Several age groups \u2013 including young people and many millennials \u2013 are ditching city life for small towns. Suppose you are also considering moving from urban areas to rural areas. In that case, you might be asking yourself a straightforward question: Why are so many people\u00a0moving out of Denver\u00a0to smaller cities? Why Are People Moving to Small Towns? The reason why people are making a move from urban areas to rural settings is complex, and ultimately, there is not one simple explanation. For some people, the congested atmosphere of living in a big city isn\u2019t worth it, and they would rather spend their evenings with actual wildlife rather than in the urban jungle. Here are a few of the most common reasons why people are contacting Denver movers to relocate to small towns: Low Cost of Living From San Francisco and Portland to New York City, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Atlanta \u2013 the cost of living in several metropolitan areas continues to rise. Living in a large city is often simply not feasible for several young people just starting out. Fewer people can afford to live in large cities when you consider the cost of everyday essentials \u2013 from your car and groceries to gas and utilities. Lower Cost Housing One of the biggest reasons people are leaving big cities is the cost of housing. To give you a better sense of just how cost-prohibitive living in a big city can be for most young adults and families, consider the average cost of renting a modest apartment in San Francisco, which is a whopping $3,340 a month! Usually, lower-cost housing is available in rural areas \u2013 but don\u2019t assume you have to move away from the hustle and bustle of a big city. If you want to enjoy greater economic health and more opportunities for high-paying jobs but still want to live in areas where houses are more affordable \u2013 the pros and Rocky Movers can provide you wit",

(561) 510-7191 Pros and Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City Pros and Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City Moving to a new town or city is an exciting prospect that offers a fresh start and an opportunity for growth. While many people dream of bustling metropolises and the bright lights of big cities, others find solace in the charm and simplicity of smaller towns. In this blog post, we will explore the pros and cons of moving to a smaller town or city, helping you make an informed decision about your next move. Pros of Moving to a Smaller Town or City: Tight-knit Community: One of the most significant advantages of moving to a smaller town or city is the strong sense of community. In close-knit communities, people tend to know their neighbors, and a friendly atmosphere prevails. This can lead to a support network that feels like an extended family, with people ready to lend a helping hand when needed. Lower Cost of Living: Smaller towns often offer a more affordable cost of living compared to larger cities. Housing prices, utility bills, and everyday expenses are generally lower, allowing you to stretch your budget further. This can be particularly advantageous for young families, retirees, or those looking to save money. Reduced Traffic and Noise: One of the drawbacks of big cities is the constant hustle and bustle, along with the never-ending traffic congestion. In smaller towns, traffic is generally lighter, making commuting a breeze and reducing daily stress. Additionally, the noise levels are usually lower, providing a peaceful and serene environment for relaxation. Cons of Moving to a Smaller Town or City: Limited Job Opportunities: Smaller towns may have a limited number of job opportunities, especially in specialized industries. If your career requires access to a wide range of job options or a specific professional network, moving to a smaller town might not be ideal.

A few years back you could have sworn that you\u2019d never leave the big city and all the indisputable advantages that a big-city life can offer. But now, due to recent developments and drastic changes in the way you live and work, you may be seriously considering moving to a small town. In fact, you may have already started getting ready, little by little, to turn that previously unthinkable move into reality. Moving from a big city to a small town can easily prove to be one of the best decisions you\u2019ve made in a long time. Or you could end up regretting the choice to leave the large city, day in and day out. Therefore, before you make up your mind for real, it\u2019s important to understand what you\u2019re getting yourself into before it\u2019s too late. Here\u2019s what you have to know when moving to a small town from a large city. Enjoy the benefits of living in a small town If you think about it really hard, you\u2019re likely to come up with many good reasons why you should move to a small town \u2013 after all, small towns have much to offer. But above all else, the move will be about your health and the health of your family, and nothing else can possibly top that. You\u2019ll discover that small-town life is healthier As a rule of thumb, the environment in a small town (population between 25,000 and 50,000 residents) is more laid back and relaxed than the hustle and bustle of city life, meaning that you\u2019ll get to experience first-hand the peace and quiet that smaller communities offer. Even time seems to be going a bit slower there and that\u2019s something that can have a hugely beneficial effect on your nervous system and your health in general.

That's exactly what happened to me. From my experience, I can offer some remarkable insights about transitioning from a big city to a small town. Motivation to move Growing up in a big city was nice. I never had to move for any reason, whether choosing a college or finding a job. The busy life, traffic, and great restaurants nearby were all normal to me. But after having a baby and facing an ongoing recession, I wanted more comfort. This led to the decision to move to a small town. Based on my experience, I can share my thoughts on this significant decision. First, it's essential to understand what you value at this stage in your life. What decisions will you need to make to fulfill those values? You'll need a plan Before making your move, you need a solid plan. You might face culture shock if you're used to the big city. Do some groundwork first. Here are some tips from my experience that I found helpful: 1. Do research Feeling overwhelmed by \"research\"? Don't worry. You don't need to be an academic researcher. Prepare for your move with YouTube videos, travel or personal vlogs, and online articles on that location so you can get an idea of what life is really like there. I followed these online resources and got the best results. I followed the Cup of Jo blog for the genuine experience of people who moved from big city to small town. 2. Make an in-person visit If possible, plan a physical visit to your desired location, as things can often look different in reality than they do on paper. This can give you a chance to explore the neighborhood and be more certain of your choice. Before moving, I gave a tour of my town. My husband had a seminar nearby, and I didn't miss that chance!

As a result, the provision of new recreational spaces in the vicinity of cities gained importance. In conditions of social distancing, rural and suburban areas can be an attractive alternative to individual short-term tourism, satisfying the need for recreation and mental and physical health restoration of urban residents. In the study a methodology for assessing the tourist and recreational potential of the area (METPRET) concerning the recreational behaviors identified in the pandemic was proposed. It includes the Recreational Potential Index (RPI), which comprises four criteria: landscape values and socio-economic conditions; environmental protection; air quality; transportation accessibility. The application of the methodology is exemplified in the Mazovia Voivodeship, Poland. The research allows the determination of characteristics that potential recreation areas should have under pandemic conditions. The RPI makes it possible to select new rural and suburban areas attractive for short-term tourism.

Lincoln R. Larson1 , Rachel Szczytko1, Edmond P. Bowers2, Lauren E. Stephens2, Kathryn T. Stevenson1, and Myron F. Floyd1 Abstract Evidence suggests that contemporary children are spending less time outdoors than their predecessors. Concurrent reports also highlight the rise of electronic media use in the lives of youth. We explored relationships between self-reported outdoor time, screen time, and connection to nature in a sample of sixth- to eighth-grade students across rural South Carolina (N = 543). We found that most youth spent time outdoors, but they spent more time with electronic media. The outdoor versus screen time discrepancy was particularly pronounced for girls, African Americans, and eighth graders. Connection to nature, linked to outdoor time, was highest among boys, White students, and sixth graders. Our study contributes to growing evidence highlighting the negative influence of escalating screen time on outdoor time and connection to nature during adolescence. Programs designed to address these troubling trends could focus on two groups at particularly high risk: girls and youth of color.

From sensory overload in urban jungles to the tranquil rhythms of rural life, these environments impact how we think, focus, and solve problems. Contents How Urban Living Stimulates Cognitive Growth Urban environments are often buzzing with sensory and intellectual stimulation. For some, this constant activity can enhance cognitive function by providing opportunities to learn, adapt, and innovate. Exposure to Diverse Stimuli Cities bombard the brain with visual, auditory, and social stimuli\u2014billboards, traffic noise, and cultural events. This exposure pushes the brain to process and prioritize information quickly, strengthening working memory and decision-making. Opportunities for Lifelong Learning Urban areas often have rich educational resources, from museums and libraries to workshops and networking events. These opportunities encourage continuous learning, which keeps the brain sharp and adaptable. Fostering Creativity and Innovation The diverse mix of people and ideas in cities fuels creativity. Interacting with individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives encourages the brain to think more flexibly and solve problems in innovative ways. The Cognitive Challenges of Urban Life While urban living can stimulate the brain, it also presents challenges that may hinder cognitive function, especially when mental overload becomes a factor. Dealing with Noise Pollution Constant exposure to noise\u2014from traffic to construction\u2014can increase stress levels and impair focus. Over time, this sensory overload may impact memory and concentration. Stress and Cognitive Decline The fast pace of city living often leads to chronic stress, which can affect the prefrontal cortex\u2014the brain\u2019s center for decision-making and emo",

Abstract In the wake of urbanisation processes and the constitution of metropolitan regions, the role of the city's rural surroundings is receiving more attention from researchers and planners as rural areas offer various (cultural) ecosystem services for the urban population. Urban dwellers increasingly desire recreation and landscape experience. Although this need for recreation is generally recognized, few studies have focused on the question of people's preferences for certain types and characteristics of outdoor recreation areas in relation to the frequency of use. In order to acquire baseline data on this subject, the main objectives of this study were to explore recreation preferences of urban dwellers and the relation between actual use and perceived value of recreation areas in a case study in the Hamburg Metropolitan Region (Germany)",

Screening for eligibility and quality assessment (using the Standard Quality Assessment Criteria for Evaluating Primary Research Papers from a Variety of Fields) were done in duplicate. We used a narrative approach to synthesize the results. Results Of 2432 non-duplicate records, 51 quantitative and 19 qualitative studies were included. Convincing positive relationships were found between the availability and accessibility of places for exercise and recreation and leisure-time PA as well as between the overall environment and leisure-time PA. Possible positive associations were found between the overall environment and total and transport-related PA, between greenness/natural environment and total PA, between cycling infrastructure and aesthetics and MVPA, and between pedestrian infrastructure and total walking. A possible negative relationship was found between safety and security and total walking. Qualitative studies ",

While there is a large body of literature examining physical activity interventions for children, the unique physical activity context of low-density communities in rural areas and smaller urban centres remains largely underexplored. With an influx of families migrating to rural communities and small towns, evaluations of health promotion efforts that support physical activity are needed to ensure they are meeting the needs of the growing populations in these settings. The aim of this community-based research was to explore service providers\u2019 and parents\u2019 perspectives on physical activity opportunities available in their community and recommendations toward the development and implementation of efficacious physical activity programming for children in rural communities and smaller urban centres. Methods Three in-person community forums with recreation service providers (n\u2009=\u200937 participants) and 1 online community forum with the parents of school-aged children (n\u2009=\u20099 participants) were hosted. An online survey and Mentimeter activity were conducted prior to the community forums to gather participants\u2019 views on the barriers and facilitators to physical activities and suggestions for activity-promoting programs. The service provider and parent discussions were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed following a deductive approach guided by Hseih and Shannon\u2019s (2005) procedure for direct content analysis. A code list developed from the responses to the pre-forum survey and Mentimeter activity was used to guide the analysis and category development. Results Seven ",

The dynamics of development are multifaceted, deeply intertwined with the structure of the population, governance, and resource allocation. Within this broad context, the distinction between rural and urban development serves as a significant topic of interest. These two spheres present unique challenges and require bespoke strategies to foster growth effectively. Understanding the differences and addressing the specific needs of each can bring about holistic national progress. In many developing countries, rural areas are typically characterized by agriculture-based economies, low population density, and limited infrastructure. On the other hand, urban areas usually have higher population densities, more diversified economies, and better access to services and infrastructure. These differences lead to distinct developmental challenges and necessitate particular focus and tailored strategies. This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these challenges and explore the strategies that can effectively address them, thereby facilitating balanced development in both rural and urban areas. Rural Development: Challenges Rural areas face a multitude of challenges that impede their development. One of the primary challenges is limited access to basic infrastructure such as roads, electricity, and water supply. The scarcity of these fundamental services can stifle agricultural productivity, hinder mobility, and negatively impact the quality of life for rural inhabitants. Additionally, educational facilities and healthcare services are often inadequate or entirely absent, contributing to high illiteracy rates and poor health outcomes. Poverty remains pervasive in many rural regions. The reliance on agriculture, especially subsistence farming, makes the rural p",

While there are a number of advantages to growing up in a rural environment, such as wide open spaces and a tight-knit community, many young people in rural America believe that the challenges outweigh the perks. Young people who choose to relocate to urban areas are typically seeking higher wages and increased access to resources such as healthcare, education, and healthy food. The Center for American Progress reports that rural areas constitute 97 percent of America\u2019s landmass, yet those same areas are home to only about one-fifth of the national population. As such, those living in rural communities are more likely to experience poverty and have reduced access to healthy food and public transportation. Further, youth in rural America may not have as much opportunity to socialize with their peers, either in person or online. For young people living below the poverty line in rural areas, the idea of moving to the big city may be enticing. But the increased job opportunities in urban areas is only a small piece of a much larger picture when it comes to social mobility. Researchers have found several key factors that support the economic advancement of young people, including str",

This global phenomenon has been reshaping cultures for ages. While migration has affected urban growth and development, it also brings challenges to both rural and urban areas. Rural-to-urban migration refers to people moving from rural to urban areas in quest of better opportunities, higher living standards, and access to critical services. The gap between rural and urban communities has grown in several countries around the world in recent years. Young people seeking opportunity and change are moving from their rural areas to the big cities, where the promise of expanded professional options, greater financial independence, and a new lifestyle typically outweigh the disadvantages. The surge in population often leads to urban overcrowding, exerting immense pressure on existing infrastructure, housing markets, transportation networks, and public services. Consequently, issues concerning sanitation, waste management, and traffic congestion emerge as pressing challenges, demanding innovative solutions for sustainable urban development. What are the causes? Economic Disparities One of the primary drivers of rural-urban migration is the significant economic disparity between rural and urban areas. Many rural regions lack access to viable job opportunities, adequate income, and basic services, prompting individuals to seek better prospects in urban centers where industries, businesses, and services are concentrated. Lack of Educational and Healthcare Facilities Rural areas often suffer from limited educational and healthcare infrastructure. As a result, young individuals and families may migrate to urban areas in search of quality education and better healthcare facilities for themselves and their children.

Urbanization is the process of populations moving from rural areas to urban centers, leading to the growth of cities and often the decline of small towns. People are drawn to cities for many reasons, including better job opportunities, educational institutions, healthcare, and lifestyle amenities. As a result, rural communities are left with shrinking populations, fewer job opportunities, and a shifting social landscape. Urbanization isn\u2019t necessarily a new phenomenon, but its scale in recent decades has been unprecedented. With industrialization, technological advances, and globalization, urban areas have become major economic and cultural hubs, attracting people from rural regions. The implications of this shift are felt by both the people moving to urban centers and those who remain in rural areas. Economic Impact on Rural Communities One of the most significant effects of urbanization on rural communities is economic change. As younger generations move to cities for work, rural areas often experience labor shortages, especially in industries like agriculture, which traditionally rely on family-owned farms and small businesses. When fewer people are available to work in these areas, productivity declines, leading to fewer goods and services and often lower economic growth. This decline in the rural workforce also impacts local businesses. Small towns depend on a steady population to support shops, schools, healthcare services, and local businesses. When populations drop, businesses suffer, often leading to closures and reduced access to essential services for those who remain. However, some rural areas are finding ways to counter this by investing in technology, creating remote work opportunities, and encouraging entrepreneurship to create a more self-sustaining economy. Social and Cultural Changes in Rural Areas Urbanization doesn\u2019t only affect the eco",

It contributes more to the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) than oil, gas, and mining combined1 and provides important amenities for residents and workers, contributes to healthy communities, helps protect the environment, and provides opportunities for businesses across multiple sectors, from services and manufacturing to retail. Like most sectors, the outdoor recreation economy was impacted by COVID-19. Employment within the sector decreased by over 10 percent from 2019-2021 and sales decreased by approximately 16 perent from 2019-2020. It has since experienced recovery. This article examines recent trends, opportunities, challenges, and successes in the U.S. outdoor recreation sector and offers guidance to help economic developers grow their outdoor recreation economy. Defining the Outdoor Recreation Economy For the purposes of this article, our definition of outdoor recreation includes direct outdoor recreation as well as highly related manufacturing, sellers, and transportation. For the full list of sectors included in this analysis, see Table 1 at the end of this article. In 2022, there were an estimated 2,964,703 jobs in the outdoor recreation economy in the U.S. As shown in Figure 1, attractions and activities jobs accounted for more than half of outdoor recreation employment, and wholesale/retail/rental jobs accounted for more than one quarter. Outdoor recreation-related manufacturing accounted for six percent of the jobs and transportation, such as scenic sightseeing jobs, only accounted for one percent. Pandemic-Era and Recent Outdoor Recreation Trends During the COVID-19 pandemic, employment in the outdoor recreation sector dropped from 3.1 million to 2.77 million, a more t",

Analysis of recent news articles and solutions shared with Aspen CSG by rural practitioners provide perspective on how to do economic development differently with rural recreation economies.\u00a0 Reporting by Sarah Melotte at The Daily Yonder digs deep into some of the\u00a0big questions around recreation economies, particularly how recreation economies influence areas of persistent poverty. Between 1979 and 2013, only 1% of recreation-dependent counties remained in persistent poverty. Of the counties that came out of persistent poverty, 24% were dependent on recreation.\u201d On the surface, this is a simple story of great success, where recreation economies helped create a more prosperous rural community. But the reality is more complex. In some rural communities, a vibrant recreation economy has reduced opportunities for the lowest-income residents, driving them to relocate out of the area to find affordable housing.\u00a0 In a follow-up to The Daily Yonder article referenced above, Melotte\u00a0explores disparities in Pitkin County, Colorado, home to Aspen ski resorts (and the Aspen Institute\u2019s original headquarters). The story of Pitkin County is one extreme example of an outdoor recreation economy, but it does have cautionary lessons for any region looking to grow in similar ways.\u00a0 Melotte writes, \u201calthough recreation can attract permanent residents and produce a diverse economy, it can center on seasonal, low-wage and low-skilled jobs while simultaneously increasing housing prices.\u201d Recreation economies do not promote prosperity if workers and families end up with poverty wages and/or are forced to relocate outside of their community.\u00a0 Additionally, even when nearby natural amenities provide the potential for local recreation economies, it doesn\u2019t always mean prosperity is around the corner.\u00a0A recent article from NPR\u00a0explores how the Redwoods National Park in California is a marvelou",

Not only is a car needed to visit, but so is a driver willing to navigate steep roads, says Bryan Matsumoto, who grew up in nearby Temple City. \u201cThe fact that there is no public transportation currently is a huge environmental injustice,\u201d says Matsumoto, a project manager with the local nonprofit Nature for All. This situation isn\u2019t exclusive to Los Angeles. In 2021, Keunhyun Park, an urban nature design researcher at the University of British Columbia, led a study that investigated public transit access to public lands in 15 of the largest western U.S. cities. In 12 cities, either lower-income communities, people of color, or seniors tended to have longer trips and less access to large parks \u201cin spite of the fact they are the groups who rely more on public transit uses,\u201d he says.\u00a0 Overall, the study found that non-Hispanic white neighborhoods had better transit options. Surprisingly, the research found little evidence of unequal access to large parks in Los Angeles, as well as Denver and Tucson. These cities, Park notes, have been investing in public transit access to nature for high-need neighborhoods. In 2019, for example, Los Angeles Metro adopted a \u201ctransit to parks\u201d strategy and created a new shuttle to connect the downtown with recreation areas.

And in the era of mobile phones, it\u2019s more important than ever to unplug and connect with the wild. This issue was underscored by a recent report issued by the Outdoor Foundation, which identified an \u201calarming trend\u201d: nearly half the U.S. population did not engage in outdoor recreation the year before last.\u00a0 Not only are adults recreating less, but so are children; the report noted a severe drop in the number of children who got outdoor activity over the course of that year, and other sources note that the average child spends only seven minutes playing outside per day. Seven. With child obesity increasingly on the rise in the U.S., it\u2019s a major cause for concern. Granted, there are sometimes socio-economic and geographic factors that play into a child\u2019s ability to get into nature; technology-based play fiercely competes for kids\u2019 attention, too, luring them to come inside and game, text, or consume video content. (Surely the same can be said for adults.) Thankfully, a growing number of organizations exist to that aim to reverse the trend. Many of these nonprofits expose urban children to outdoor activities they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise encountered (whether for economic or geographic reasons), while others simply want to strengthen a communal bond with the outdoor world. All of them foster a love of the earth, increased well being, and critical life skills. As Whitney Houston famously sang, the children are our future\u2014I\u2019d take it one step forward to posit that the youth can leverage the skills they learn in these programs to heal their communities and the planet.\u00a0 Big City Mountaineers, Golden, CO A post shared by Big City Mountaineers (@big_city_mounta",

Outdoor adventure camps (OACs) provide an excellent opportunity for engaging these youth in experiences that can help promote positive youth development (PYD). In the present study, we examined the experiences and perceptions of 75 urban youth who participated in a 3-day high adventure camp experience. Through a mixed-method approach, results indicated that urban youth from all racial and ethnic backgrounds grew in several PYD outcomes including social competencies and self-improvement capacities. Many youth also reported growing in their connection to nature as a consequence of participating in the OAC. Youth thought camp was a positive and worthwhile experience, reflecting key attributes of a PYD setting. Overall, the OAC provided a challenging and engaging growth environment for youth. Findings highlight implications for socially just and culturally inclusive outdoor adventure programming aimed at diverse urban youth. Author Biographies Edmond P.

Asia alone is home to 60 percent of the world\u2019s youth, while a further 18 percent live in Africa. Within Africa, 61 percent of the entire population are under 24 years of age, representing current and future youth cohorts of a sobering magnitude. The majority of the world\u2019s youth live and work in rural areas. Lacking access to productive resources, many rural youths rely on their own labour to earn a living. However, rural labour markets in most developing countries do not provide sufficient decent work opportunities3 for young women and men, compromising their ability to lead productive lives. Decent work deficits that rural youth face include: weak enforcement of labour legislation; insecure and low incomes; poor health, safety and environmental conditions; gender inequality in pay and opportunities; the exploitation of migrant workers; inadequate social protection; and weak social dialogue. These decent work deficits are reflected in the disproportionately high levels of unemployment, underemployment and poverty among young people. In 2012, the global youth unemployment rate was 12.4 percent, almost three times higher than the corresponding rate for adults.4 Furthermore, young people account for 23.5 percent of the world\u2019s working poor.5 In Africa, over 70 percent of youths subsist on less than USD2 per day,6 and the incidence of decent work deficits and poverty are particularly high among young rural women.

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative. About Youth Futures Foundation Youth Futures Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation established with a \u00a390m endowment from the Reclaim Fund to improve employment outcomes for young people from marginalised backgrounds.

Some\u00a01.2 billion youth\u00a0make up 14 percent of the global population, and almost 88 percent\u00a0of them come from developing countries. This means a large number of young people with great potential and aspirations, but facing big constraints and challenges to build their future. On International Youth Day 2017, FAO joins the world to recognize the importance of young people to build a future based on peace and prosperity. \u00a0 FAO is helping countries create more employment opportunities for youth in rural areas, by harnessing the potential of agricultural and rural livelihoods. \"Fostering sustainable agriculture and rural development is essential to absorb these millions of youth looking for a job\" said the Director-General of the UN Food and Agriculture Organization Jos\u00e9 Graziano da Silva during\u00a0a joint African Union-European Union meeting, hosted at FAO headquarters in Rome last June. \"A sustainable world can only be achieved with the full engagement of young people. They must feel integrated and believe that a more peaceful and prosperous world is possible\". While population grows, employment opportunities remain limited\u00a0and of poor quality for young people in rural areas. They often earn low wages and face unsafe, exploitative working conditions, which force them to\u00a0migrate\u00a0to urban areas or leave their country to look for better opportunities. In 2015, of the 244 million people who crossed the border in search of a better life, about one-third was between 15 and 34 years old. In addition, there were 763 million internal migrants. Many young migrants come from rural areas where the lack of productive and decent employment opportunities perpetuates poverty, food insecurity and economic fragility. Conflicts and natural disasters adds further pressure on rural livelihoods, all of which leads to forced migration and displacement of youth internally and abroad.

Instead, they're heading to rural areas. Communities with under 250,000 residents have seen a growing influx of Gen Z and millennial movers. About 63% of counties classified as rural or in small metros had increases in this age demographic between 2020 and 2023 \u2014 compared to 27% between 2010 and 2013, based on an analysis by Hamilton Lombard, a demographer at the University of Virginia. In particular, young people are flocking to rural communities in the Colorado Rockies, Georgia's Blue Ridge Mountains, and Montana's lakes, drawn by new work opportunities and the appeal of living surrounded by nature, Lombard's analysis showed. This map shows the percentage change in every US county for those aged 25 to 24 between 2020 and 2023. Many of the biggest gainers are rural and exurban areas in the South and Mountain West. The top 10 counties with the highest net percent increase between 2020 and 2023 of those aged 25 to 44 were all either rural or in metro areas with fewer than 250,000 residents. On the other hand, cities have seen stagnant or declining populations among the 25-44 age group. Of the 10 most populous US counties, five had declines, while two stayed the same. Los Angeles County had a 4% net loss in this demographic, while Kings County \u2014 or Brooklyn \u2014 lost 8%.

City dwellers also may have gotten more conservative. \"The people who leave big blue cities probably don't have the same politics \u2014 or don't have exactly the same politics \u2014 as people who stay,\" Kolko said. \"And wanting to move to a community where people have similar views could be on the list of reasons why someone moves.\" Millennials and Gen Zers \u2014 both represented in that 25 to 44 group \u2014 have swung more to the right.

Millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers are leaving big cities for small-town life. Since 2014, around 30,000 city dwellers aged 24-40 have fled the city rat race yearly for small towns.\u00a0 The pandemic accelerated this trend of young people moving to small towns in their 20s and 30s. CNBC reports 32% of Gen Z and 26% of millennials relocated to smaller towns and rural areas during the pandemic. Key reasons include being closer to family/friends (31%), more affordable living (27%), or working remotely (17%). Let's dive deeper into why young people move to small towns: \u00a0 REASONS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO SMALL TOWNS Peasley Boise Movers cites several driving factors: Less Stressful Life The sheer volume of people, energy, and city hustle adds stress to everything. Add kids, and getting anywhere becomes far more difficult. Small towns avoid this. Lower Cost of LivingHousing, entertainment, groceries, parking - almost everything costs more in cities. Childcare alone \u00a0can be nearly as much as a mortgage payment. Paying $18 for a burger, $500 monthly for two parking spots, or $250 for a haircut/color leaves little savings room. Many millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers in their 20s and 30s aim to buy houses and start families. But this dream may be out of reach in the city, despite good incomes. The culprit? Crushing student debt. According to the Education Data Initiative, in 2021, federal student loan debt topped out at $1.57 trillion, with Gen X carrying an average of $45,095 per person and Millennials $38,877 on average. Gen Z's averages $17,388 so far. Burdened by debt, these young people can't afford the city home prices. But in small towns, they suddenly get more house and land tha",

One assumption about population migration is that people are moving from one major metro to another in search of work and lower living costs, going from gateway cities to the Sun Belt. As often happens, common assumptions can overlook something significant. In this case, there's an entirely different twist proven by Census Bureau data, as Hamilton Lombard, estimates program manager of the Demographics Research Group at the University of Virginia, recently wrote. Younger people are moving to small towns and rural counties at rates not seen since, at least, the 1970s. Through the 1970s, the population size from ages 25 to 44 in MSAs with fewer than 250,000 people or in rural counties began to fall until sometime during the early 1990s when the change in population from migration crossed a zero line and became negative. This continued until early in the 2010s, when at about a loss of 1.5% annually, the trend reversed and started to climb sharply. Want to continue reading?Become a Free ALM Digital Reader.

In order to achieve this goal, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates to historic levels, reaching 20 percent in 1981. Though Volcker ultimately succeeded in reducing inflation, it had many side effects. The ensuing recession, a strong dollar, and tax reforms accelerated the transition of the U.S. economy from manufacturing to a service-based economy. Manufacturing jobs, which peaked at 19.5 million in 1979, fell to under 11.5 million during the pandemic, while employment in finance and professional and business services soared from 12 million to 32 million. This economic shift brought with it a demographic realignment, with population growth concentrating in large metros where service industries thrived. While it remains uncertain whether we are now witnessing another such shift, Census data released over the summer shows that the demographic trends that have persisted this decade are unlike any seen since before 1980.

(RISI) received funding from the U.S. Economic Development Administration (EDA) Research and National Technical Assistance (RNTA) program to think critically about tech-based economic development in rural places across the country. How have rural communities experienced the process of digital economic development? What challenges did they face? What types of unexpected opportunities did they encounter? And what types of economic forces impacted their efforts?\u00a0 This deep dive led to the creation of two different series of publications: a set of five qualitative case studies to understand the experiences of rural places undertaking digital economic development and a set of five policy/research briefs to assess the economic factors that are most likely to impact rural places in the U.S. in the coming years. At a February roundtable webinar event, our team offered insight into the three major trends from across all the research. Several rural practitioners joined us to compare\u00a0 their practical, on-the-ground context with the data and theory we gathered throughout our work.\u00a0 Now, this entire suite of resources detailing how rural communities across the country are grappling with tech-based economic development is available to anyone \u2014 rural community leaders, economic development practitioners, policymakers, and residents alike.

Historically, certain professions such as writers, artists, and consultants have enjoyed the liberty of working remotely. However, it was the advent of the internet and the proliferation of digital technologies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries that truly revolutionized remote work. The rise of virtual assistants, virtual jobs, and remote workers has created a paradigm shift, enabling a significant portion of the workforce to operate outside traditional office environments. \r Importance of Analyzing Its Impact on Urban and Rural Areas\r Analyzing the impact of remote work on urban and rural areas is essential for several reasons. Firstly, it helps in understanding the shifting economic dynamics and how resources are reallocated between these regions. Secondly, it sheds light on the social and environmental consequences of this transition. Lastly, it informs future urban planning and rural development strategies, ensuring that both areas can thrive in the new remote work era.\r \r Turn into a Nearshore Virtual Professional and check the job opportunities. \r \r The Rise of Remote Work \r Technological Advancements \r The rise of remote work can be largely attributed to technological advancements.

In addition, manufacturing establishments\u2014some involved in processing food, wood and mining products, but most in \"footloose\" activities unrelated to local natural resources\u2014have been a key part of many rural economies. Rural areas tend to have significantly fewer financial, professional, scientific and information services activities that concentrate in urban economies. The public sector has been a major source of earned income in rural areas. Trends in these activities shape the job opportunities available to the rural labor force. A summary of rural employment and industry\u00a0topics (among other rural issues) is found in the Rural America At A Glance series, updated in the fall of each year. See the latest report in the series: During the 2000s, especially during the recession, rural areas lost about a quarter of their manufacturing jobs due both to overseas competition and increases in productivity. Despite subsequent gains, the number of manufacturing jobs in 2014 remained 20 percent below the 2000 level. This has been a major challenge for rural areas dependent on manufacturing, especially since rural production jobs in this sector have tended to pay better than available local alternatives.

Social impact is frequently highlighted as concept in urban environments because many multinational corporations are headquartered in major metro centers. Rural communities, however, are often the areas that are more resource-constrained in terms of dollars invested. Yet, the partners who engage there often find that these areas are ripe with opportunities for more corporate investment to lift economic prosperity and community well-being. Indeed, companies are more likely to have the bandwidth and resources to convene representatives from community organizations, members of state and local government, and small-to-medium-size enterprises (SMEs) to better pool expertise and investment to create a greater return on investment than if these companies were acting alone. At the same time, there are players operating within ex-urban settings from which we can learn, especially from those social innovation players now working in rural areas to help increase the economic welfare of rural communities. Community capital creates thriving rural communities Social innovation provides two primary ways of convening partners and resources to provide holistic benefits in rural areas.

Local leaders are getting more proactive about nurturing entrepreneurial ecosystems by providing support systems, resources and an environment conducive for aspiring business owners to thrive. The Rural Potential Research shows rural counties tend to have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors compared to metro areas. However, rural entrepreneurship had been waning for years prior to the pandemic, with more firms closing than opening annually in rural regions between 2008-2018. That negative trend now appears to be reversing. Organizations like Higher Purpose Co. in Mississippi are empowering Black entrepreneurs through coordinated funding assistance, business training, marketing help and more. Rural communities are increasingly tapping into the underutilized talent pool of older workers and entrepreneurs as well. Entrepreneurship is especially critical in providing economic opportunities to people of color who are disproportionately impacted by unemployment and other economic challenges in rural areas.

Recently, the rise of the knowledge economy, driven by technological advancements, has accelerated economic inequities, and the concentration of key ingredients supporting knowledge economies in large cities has only intensified this trend (Moretti, 2013; Gbohoui et al, 2019; Muro & Perry, 2020). These are patterns of economic disparity that we can see repeating and amplifying over time: By December 2022, 63% of rural counties had fewer jobs than they did before the Great Recession in August 2007, while nonrural counties had both recovered and exceeded their pre-recession employment (BLS). And zooming out even further from the present day, we can see evidence of this trend over the last half-century as a gulf emerged between rural and nonrural employment: Economic opportunity also starkly varies by race, location, and class. About 80% of counties with long-term, persistent poverty are rural, and in approximately 25% of those counties people of color make up a higher share (2021 ACS). These trends bear out in other indicators of economic wellbeing too. While overall employment in rural areas has increased by 7% in the last 10 years, employment in Black and Native American or Alaska Native communities has increased at a far slower rate, 3.4% and 3.3% respectively (2012 & 2021 ACS).\u00a0 In addition to the slower overall employment growth experienced in rural areas since 1970, the primary industries that are most often associated with rural economies actually decreased in their share of the total employment in rural counties. Agriculture, manufacturing, and mining now account for less than 25% of rural employment, in large part due to automation technology: Yet, as these traditional rural industries became less significant contributors to rural employment and economic activity, there has not been a corresponding shift in attentio",

Fast-growing rural areas are facing increasing\u00a0development pressures and resultant challenges, such as housing affordability and traffic congestion.\u00a0In addition, many rural areas are struggling with the loss of farmland and working lands, job and labor shortages, or other workforce development issues. Many rural communities are also increasingly facing the impacts of climate climate, with many having experienced and/or recovering from weather-related disasters. To foster greater resilience, small towns and rural communities are identifying ways to strengthen their built environment and economies, provide better a quality of life for residents, and enhance local assets.\u00a0 Through its work in partnership with small towns and rural communities, EPA has identified several smart growth strategies for these types of communities to consider: A comprehensive approach to planning for growth or managing decline can support a cohesive, community-centered framework for meeting the current and evolving needs of small towns and rural communities.

Coffee shop and bar When you think of your neighborhood coffee shop and bar, you might not think of the same establishment. But if your town is small enough, and clientele scarce, merging these two business ideas might be just what the mayor ordered. Now, before you go telling us that combining after-school 12-year-olds and college 21-year-olds is a terrible idea, hear us out. We\u2019re not suggesting a full-on bar, simply a coffee shop that after 4 pm also serves wine and beer. The concept behind being a coffee shop that serves alcohol is that in the post-noon hours, coffee consumption begins to taper off significantly. If you\u2019re looking to stay open later and need the cash, filling an additional need in your small community is the perfect business idea. Now you not only have a place for business meetings and freelancers, but also happy hours and first dates. One additional thing to keep in mind is to make sure that your coffee shop design appeals to both a mid-day and a post-work crowd. Nothing says small town charm like a simple, relaxed business layout. Opting for a design concept that is genuine and modest, along with a coffee shop POS that will make order",

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative. About Youth Futures Foundation Youth Futures Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation established with a \u00a390m endowment from the Reclaim Fund to improve employment outcomes for young people from marginalised backgrounds.

While there are a number of advantages to growing up in a rural environment, such as wide open spaces and a tight-knit community, many young people in rural America believe that the challenges outweigh the perks. Young people who choose to relocate to urban areas are typically seeking higher wages and increased access to resources such as healthcare, education, and healthy food. The Center for American Progress reports that rural areas constitute 97 percent of America\u2019s landmass, yet those same areas are home to only about one-fifth of the national population. As such, those living in rural communities are more likely to experience poverty and have reduced access to healthy food and public transportation. Further, youth in rural America may not have as much opportunity to socialize with their peers, either in person or online. For young people living below the poverty line in rural areas, the idea of moving to the big city may be enticing. But the increased job opportunities in urban areas is only a small piece of a much larger picture when it comes to social mobility.

Small Towns: An Unexpected Home for Young Entrepreneurs For those of us in Rural America, we're used to hearing (and often believing, unfortunately) the narrative that our best and brightest are moving away. The media calls it the \"Brain Drain\" suggesting that we educate our kids, only to encourage them to leave, stealing any chance for us to realize a return on the investment of that education. Recently, we sat down with one of our bright, talented young people who returned to our community. At the fresh age of just 24, Addison Magill is running a successful business and she was gracious enough to share with us just how our community and her experiences as a kid shaped her into who she is today. When we sat down, Addison was one week away from presenting at a conference called Tomorrow's Top Hands with the North Dakota Stockmen's Association. When asked more about the nature of the conference, Addison said, \"Basically, it's trying to build leaders in the beef industry. They get to tour some different places within the industry, hear from speakers, and learn about the career paths they can follow within the beef industry.\" Specifically, she'd been asked to be on a panel for entrepreneurship within the beef industry. Addison is the founder and lead creator of Addison K. Creative Co., a creative company founded on production ag values, designed to build livestock and agribusiness brands. When she was a freshman in high school, Addison attended this conference. \"I had been involved in some other leadership programs for Future Farmers of America (FFA), and it just felt like a good fit. I knew I wanted to be in the beef industry and I thought it was a great opportunity to connect with other people with similar interests and build my leadership skills.\" It's wild for Addison to look back on her journey from being a student in the audience to a presenter on the stage. \"I really got started with the communication side of the ag business when my family had a cattle sale and I st",

It helps finance their project or venture by raising small amounts of money from people online.\u00a0 Ordinary people usually make investments through crowdfunding platforms. They do so out of strong belief in the initiative without expecting a return on investment.

As entrepreneurs, women face multiple challenges including limited access to funding and mentors, and balancing work with family responsibilities. Apart from not being taken seriously, women also have to put in extra hard work in building a support network. These challenges are compounded if the woman entrepreneur is from a rural area. India\u2019s hinterland, even today, is plagued by patriarchal norms which perpetuate the belief that women should stay indoors. Stepping out to take on a leadership role, set up an enterprise, create an ecosystem and interact with people outside the family circle requires more than double the efforts a woman entrepreneur would have to put in if the business was in an urban area. Despite this, many women from villages have risen to the challenges and set up their successful businesses. They have succeeded by creating enterprises that positively impact underprivileged communities and empower women around them. Rural women entrepreneurs are not only an asset to society, but they are also an inspiration for other women and girls. Every success story in the hinterland encourages hundreds of other women to break the shackles of patriarchy and step out into the world on their own.

Rosenfeld FACING THE CHALLENGES Rural economies and prosperity depend on the skills and knowl\u00ad edge of their workforces and thus on their public schools. In the past, less than 12 years of education, supplemented by tacit knowledge acquired from colleagues, family, and friends, was sufficient to sustain rural economies, whether dependent on agriculture, mining, industry, or services. But that economic reality no longer exists for most of rural America. Markets and workplaces have been transformed by global competition, digitalization, and automation, dramatically altering the skills, knowledge, and work habits needed and expected of rural busi\u00ad nesses and employees. Today, about 63 percent of the workforce requires some postsecondary education. This poses a serious challenge for rural areas\u2014particularly in the South and Appalachia\u2014that in the past have produced low levels of academic attainment and achievement. The challenges rural workforce development faces include the loss of former sources of employment; an aging population with relatively low levels of education and limited experience to prepare them for a more highly skilled and often digitized workplace; population density that limits choices of programs that can be offered; and the absence of a national system of education or workforce development needed to devise, improve, and/or fund programs to improve rural workforce development. In 2014, about one in four nonmetro businesses\u2014as com\u00ad pared to one in six metro businesses\u2014reported a \u201cvery difficult time finding workers,\u201d attributing it primarily to the quality of the rural labor pool (Economic Research Service 2014, n.p.).

The U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s annual Rural America at a Glance report shows more than 20% of rural residents are over age 65 compared to 16% in urban areas. Declines in the \u201cworking-age\u201d population may make it harder to meet labor demands in some rural industries and local labor markets. At the same time, many rural areas lack sufficient health care capacity, broadband service, community centers, and other services to address the challenges associated with an aging population. In addition, racial and ethnic diversity is one of the most commonly misunderstood aspects of rural America. Even though white people still represent the majority of the rural population (76%), that ignores that 86 of the 100 most marginalized counties in the country are rural, 60 of which are located in Tribal lands or Southern regions with disproportionately large populations of Black residents. It is a misconception that renders invisible the 14 million Black, Hispanic and Latino, Asian, Native, and multiracial people who live in rural America (2020 census-nonmetro plus). This article sheds light on the hurdles faced by rural American job seekers and offers insights into potential strategies to address these issues effectively, ultimately fostering more successful job searches and more equitable access to economic opportunity. Limited Broadband Access There is no question that technology has become more available and affordable for most Americans at all socioeconomic levels.

Violent crime rates in urban settings are notably higher, with 24.5 incidents per 1,000 people in 2021, compared to 11.1 per 1,000 in rural areas. This stark contrast extends to specific violent crimes like rape, robbery, and assault. Urban environments also see more firearm-related violent crimes. However, the property crime landscape tells a different story. Surprisingly, rural areas often experience higher rates of certain property crimes, particularly burglaries. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key crime rate differences: These statistics underscore the complex nature of criminal activity across different settings. Urban areas face greater challenges with violent crime, while rural communities grapple with specific property crime issues. Understanding these nuances is best for tailoring effective law enforcement strategies and public safety measures to each unique environment. Factors Influencing Crime in Rural Areas Rural areas face unique challenges that impact crime rates and patterns. I\u2019ve identified several key factors that contribute to criminal activity in these regions, based on my research and analysis. Socioeconomic Conditions Rural communities often grapple with economic hardships that can fuel criminal behavior. Limited job opportunities, lower income levels, and higher poverty rates create an environment where some individuals turn to illegal activities for financial gain. Substance abuse, particularly the opioid epidemic, exacerbates these issues. The lack of resources for mental health and addiction treatment in rural areas further compounds the problem, leaving many without the support they need to break cycles of criminal behavior. Community Cohesion While rural areas typically boast stronger social ties, this can have both positive and negative effects on crime rates. Tight-knit communities often lead to increased",

For an individual to feel free from risk (and fear) of danger is a fundamental necessity regardless of where one lives, whether in the countryside or in megacities. Yet, safety has too often been associated with rural environments, and unsafety with urban environments. Images of \u201cthe rural\u201d consisting of simple, harmonious, cohesive, and homogeneous communities are placed in contrast to \u201cthe urban\u201d as complex, unbalanced, fragmented, and heterogeneous (Doyle 1981; Lockie and Bourke 2001; Squire 1993; Wang\u00fcemert 2001). Now more than ever, the dynamics of rural and urban areas show strong interlinkages (e.g., Sethi and Puppim de Oliveira 2015). While urban areas may provide employment opportunities, development of technology and information systems, almost all societally critical resources are imported from the rural such as water and other raw materials. These interlinkages are also expressed by the way criminality takes place in cities and villages, connected in cyberspace and/or places far away (e.g., Harding 2020), and by the way societies are dealing with these increasing safety challenges (e.g., Donnermeyer 2018; Hodgkinson and Harkness 2020).

Yet, until recently, criminology and other related sciences have neglected the nature and levels of crime outside urban areas (Donnermeyer 2016). There exists a multitude of reasons why scholars, policy and decision-makers as well as individuals in general should care about crime and safety in rural areas. First, some acts of crime in rural areas may only be possible when embedded in those particular situational contexts, which, if not considered, may hamper crime prevention; environmental and wildlife crimes are typical examples. Second, low crime rates in rural areas are often taken as an indication that rural crime and safety are not worthy of attention (Yarwood 2001), which obviously disregards the impact of crime on local residents. A reason for this lack of attention is perhaps the widespread belief in a dichotomy between urban and rural; the former being criminogenic, and the latter being problem-free, idyllic, healthy, and friendly (Ceccato 2016). Therefore in this book we distance ourselves from these assumptions to unravel facets of th",

Authors Affiliation Abstract Study objectives: Many US cities have experienced population reductions, often blamed on crime and interpersonal injury. Yet the overall injury risk in urban areas compared with suburban and rural areas has not been fully described. We begin to investigate this evidence gap by looking specifically at injury-related mortality risk, determining the risk of all injury death across the rural-urban continuum. Methods: A cross-sectional time-series analysis of US injury deaths from 1999 to 2006 in counties classified according to the rural-urban continuum was conducted. Negative binomial generalized estimating equations and tests for trend were completed. Total injury deaths were the primary comparator, whereas differences by mechanism and age were also explored. Results: A total of 1,295,919 injury deaths in 3,141 US counties were analyzed. Injury mortality increased with increasing rurality. Urban counties demonstrated the lowest death rates, significantly less than rural counties (mean difference=24.0 per 100,000; 95% confidence interval 16.4 to 31.6 per 100,000). After adjustment, the risk of injury death was 1.22 times higher in the most rural counties compared with the most urban (95% confidence interval 1.07 to 1.39). Conclusion: Usin",

Violent crime rates in urban settings are notably higher, with 24.5 incidents per 1,000 people in 2021, compared to 11.1 per 1,000 in rural areas. This stark contrast extends to specific violent crimes like rape, robbery, and assault. Urban environments also see more firearm-related violent crimes. However, the property crime landscape tells a different story. Surprisingly, rural areas often experience higher rates of certain property crimes, particularly burglaries. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key crime rate differences: These statistics underscore the complex nature of criminal activity across different settings. Urban areas face greater challenges with violent crime, while rural communities grapple with specific property crime issues. Understanding these nuances is best for tailoring effective law enforcement strategies and public safety measures to each unique environment. Factors Influencing Crime in Rural Areas Rural areas face unique challenges that impact crime rates and patterns. I\u2019ve identified several key factors that contribute to criminal activity in these regions, based on my research and analysis. Socioeconomic Conditions Rural communities often grapple with economic hardships that can fuel criminal behavior. Limited job opportunities, lower income levels, and higher poverty rates create an environment where some individuals turn to illegal activities for financial gain. Substance abuse, particularly the opioid epidemic, exacerbates these issues. The lack of resources for mental health and addiction treatment in rural areas further compounds the problem, leaving many without the support they need to break cycles of criminal behavior. Community Cohesion While rural areas typically boast stronger social ties, this can have both positive and negative effects on crime rates. Tight-knit communities often lead to increased",

Crime victimization rates are higher in urban than rural areas, but despite a rise in urban violent crime victimizations reported in 2021, rates have been falling for decades. Updated on Mon, September 25, 2023 by the USAFacts Team In 2021, crime victimization rates were higher in urban than rural areas. In urban settings, 24.5 out of 1,000 people aged 12 or older reported being the victims of violent crimes, and 157.5 reported being the victims of property crimes. In rural settings, those figures were 11.1 and 57.7, respectively. How many people report being victims of crime? In 2021, more than 4.5 million violent incidents involving victims ages 12 and older were self-reported in the US in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). In the same year, 11.7 million property victimizations were also reported, according to the Criminal Victimization report from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics. Despite this, US crime victimization rates have been on an overall downward trend since 1995. The DOJ tracks crime victimization data by location, which shows how trends vary for urban, suburban, and rural areas. One common narrative is that urban crime victimization rates exceed those in rural areas \u2014 and this is true, based on the data. Violent crime victimizations In 2021, 4.6 million violent victimizations were reported across all locations in the NCVS.

From 2011 to 2020, the most rural counties in the U.S. had a 37% higher rate of gun deaths per capita than the most urban counties, according to research published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Surgery. That's up from a 25% difference from 2000 to 2010. The findings are based on an analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The authors attributed the trend to a rise in gun suicides, which outnumbered gun homicides in 2021 by more than 5,300 and are more likely to occur in rural counties. \"Rural areas are sort of ignored when we pass firearm laws, because people think that it\u2019s just a city problem, while it\u2019s not,\" said Paul Reeping, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of California, Davis' Violence Prevention Research Program, who conducted the research as a doctoral student at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. \"Suicides were always the highest in rural areas. That hasn\u2019t changed,\" Reeping said. \"It's just that the gun deaths overall have gone up, including firearm suicides, in those areas.\" From 2011 to 2020, the most rural counties had a 46% lower rate of gun homicide deaths than the most urban counties but a 76% higher rate of gun suicide deaths, according to Reeping\u2019s analysis. The map below, which uses a different CDC dataset from the set the report used, shows where gun deaths were concentrated from 2011 to 2020. Counties in darker blue had higher rates of firearm deaths per 100,000 people. CDC data suggests firearm death rates tend to be highest in mountain states like Arizona, Idaho, Nevada and Wyoming.

When it comes to deciding between living in a small town or a big city, there are several factors to consider. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, and what may be better for one person may not be the ideal choice for another. Here are some key points to consider: 1. More access to everything In a big city, you will have better access to a wide range of amenities and services. Big cities offer a multitude of options for entertainment, dining, shopping, and cultural activities. You will find a diverse range of restaurants, museums, theaters, and shopping centers to explore. 2. Better access to medical care Medical facilities in big cities have more advanced healthcare options and specialists compared to their small-town counterparts. If you prioritize access to top-notch medical care, living in a big city may be more beneficial for you. 3. Safer environment Statistically, small towns tend to have lower crime rates compared to big cities. The close-knit community in small towns often fosters a sense of safety and security. However, it is essential to be mindful that crime rates can vary and should not be the sole deciding factor. 4. Slower Pace Living in a small town provides an opportunity to slow things down. Life in big cities can be fast-paced and hectic, whereas small towns offer a more relaxed and laid-back lifestyle. If you prefer a slower pace of life and want to escape the hustle and bustle, a small town may be a better fit. 5. Job opportunities Big cities tend to have a wider range of job opportunities across various industries. Companies and businesses are often concentrated in urban areas, providing more options for employment. However, it\u2019s worth noting that competition for jobs in big cities can be fierce. 6.

Exploring the Safety of Small Towns vs. Big Cities As a traveling chef, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit various cities and towns across the country. One question that often comes up in conversations is whether small towns are safer than big cities. It\u2019s a topic that sparks curiosity and debate among many people. So, I decided to delve into the issue and explore the safety differences between small towns and big cities. According to a recent study analyzing FBI crime statistics, small cities and towns with populations ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 residents have a staggering 48% lower crime rate than larger cities. The data clearly suggests that small towns tend to be safer in terms of crime compared to big cities. This finding challenges the common assumption that big cities are more dangerous. The study also highlights that the violent crime rate in large cities is nearly double that of small cities. This means that living in a small town significantly reduces the risk of being a victim of violent crimes. Moreover, smaller towns often have a tighter-knit community, fostering a sense of security and connection among residents. Research shows that having a small number of close relationships is one of the highest predictors of happiness, further supporting the notion that small towns contribute to a safer and happier environment. In addition to lower crime rates, small towns offer other advantages that contribute to a sense of safety and well-being. One notable advantage is the cleaner air quality found in small towns. The absence of heavy traffic, factories, and power plants leads to less pollution, resulting in fresher and healthier air. This cleaner environment can have a positive impact on residents\u2019 overall health and well-being. Furthermore, small towns often provide a more peaceful atmosphere compared to the hustle and bustle of big cities.

In this blog post, we will discuss various benefits and challenges of living in a small town community. Benefits of Living in a Small Town Community 1. Sense of Community Small towns offer a sense of community that is hard to come across in big cities. The community spirit and tight-knit relationships built in small towns can strengthen the sense of belonging. You can make friends easier and communicate in the community as everyone knows each other. This sense of community can have a positive impact on people\u2019s well-being and mental health. 2. Lower Cost of Living Generally, small towns offer a lower cost of living when compared to large cities. This is because the cost of living in a big city can be a burden, with high rental prices, expensive property, and costly health care services. Smaller towns largely provide affordable housing, lower taxes rates, and cheaper services on almost everything essential like groceries, gas, and restaurants. Smaller towns are a viable option for people looking for an affordable way of living. 3. A slower pace of life Small towns are usually set at a slower pace of life when compared to the hustle and bustle of big cities. This is because small towns lack the fast-paced lifestyle of big cities, which allows for relaxation and a stress-free way of living. Stress levels are often lower, and the peace and serenity can have a calming effect on people\u2019s lives. 4.

Scholars have long examined an individual\u2019s perception of their safety (subjective well-being) and the reality of crime (objective well-being) in their cities and towns. Here, we examine the role that safety has in affecting a community\u2019s sense of well-being at a neighborhood scale. Positive community development requires that a neighborhood be safe. Improving safety is not just a role for the police and other governmental agencies. Instead, residents are important, even primary creators of safe neighborhoods in partnership with the criminal justice system. Critical to developing strong community actions to sustain safety are two relatively new concepts in sociology, criminology, and urban planning: social capital and collective efficacy. We discuss the role these concepts play in increasing a community\u2019s sense of well-being through networking and connectivity, which leads to increased safety and happiness.

The sources and recommended readings are provided solely for informational purposes. Why Police-Community Relationships Are Important Strong relationships of mutual trust between police agencies and the communities they serve are critical to maintaining public safety and effective policing. Police officials rely on the cooperation of community members to provide information about crime in their neighborhoods, and to work with the police to devise solutions to crime and disorder problems. Similarly community members\u2019 willingness to trust the police depends on whether they believe that police actions reflect community values and incorporate the principles of procedural justice and legitimacy. In the wake of recent incidents involving police use of force and other issues, the legitimacy of the police has been questioned in many communities. Many cities in the United States experienced large-scale demonstrations and protest marches in 2014 and 2015, and in some cases, there have been riots over perceptions of police misconduct and excessive use of force. It is imperative that police agencies make improving relationships with their local communities a top priority. On July 10, 2015, the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) hosted a national meeting of police and community leaders, from around the nation, for a day-long discussion of strategies for building trust between the police and community. These community leaders offered guidance about several ways in which police can demonstrate an understanding of issues so as to build trust. Following are some key issues and recommendations that were identified during the meeting, along with other promising practices, that can be used to help police departments and their communities to develop collaborative strategies for movin",

By joining hands, local organizations, law enforcement, and residents are working together to make neighborhoods safer. This collaboration is not just about reducing crime \u2014 it\u2019s about building trust, creating support systems, and addressing the root causes of safety issues. Let\u2019s explore how these partnerships strengthen public safety and the steps communities take to keep everyone secure. How Do Community Partnerships Make An Impact? Community partnerships bring local groups and residents together with law enforcement to tackle safety concerns from multiple angles. These partnerships offer various benefits, like: Key Areas Where Partnerships Work The effects of these partnerships can be seen in various areas, from youth intervention programs to services for victims of crime. Here\u2019s how they come into play: Youth Engagement Programs Keeping young people safe and engaged is a major focus of community partnerships. Programs that are specifically designed to help the youth offer a positive influence and help them avoid risky situations. Many partnerships host activities and provide resources, which may include: These programs do more than keep kids off the streets; they also give them a sense of belonging and purpose. Victim Support Services Support services are critical for anybody impacted by crime. Nearby associations work with police to ensure that casualties get the assistance they require. Through services like the Dade County Victim Services, people affected by crime can access advice, legitimate help, and support to help their recovery. Casualty support services help people heal and recapture steadiness. This reinforces the local area, as individuals feel more secure, realizing they won\u2019t be left alone to deal with awful encounters.

Millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers are leaving big cities for small-town life. Since 2014, around 30,000 city dwellers aged 24-40 have fled the city rat race yearly for small towns.\u00a0 The pandemic accelerated this trend of young people moving to small towns in their 20s and 30s. CNBC reports 32% of Gen Z and 26% of millennials relocated to smaller towns and rural areas during the pandemic. Key reasons include being closer to family/friends (31%), more affordable living (27%), or working remotely (17%). Let's dive deeper into why young people move to small towns: \u00a0 REASONS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO SMALL TOWNS Peasley Boise Movers cites several driving factors: Less Stressful Life The sheer volume of people, energy, and city hustle adds stress to everything. Add kids, and getting anywhere becomes far more difficult. Small towns avoid this. Lower Cost of LivingHousing, entertainment, groceries, parking - almost everything costs more in cities. Childcare alone \u00a0can be nearly as much as a mortgage payment. Paying $18 for a burger, $500 monthly for two parking spots, or $250 for a haircut/color leaves little savings room. Many millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers in their 20s and 30s aim to buy houses and start families. But this dream may be out of reach in the city, despite good incomes. The culprit? Crushing student debt. According to the Education Data Initiative, in 2021, federal student loan debt topped out at $1.57 trillion, with Gen X carrying an average of $45,095 per person and Millennials $38,877 on average. Gen Z's averages $17,388 so far. Burdened by debt, these young people can't afford the city home prices. But in small towns, they suddenly get more house and land tha",

The colored swing column in the table shows the percentage point change in vote share for Trump between 2020 and 2024. The blue squares mean fewer of that county's votes went to Trump in 2024; however, the majority still went Republican in both elections, as seen in the last two columns. Counties in red swung even more toward Trump in 2024 than in 2020. The politics of America's counties are changing Rural areas moved right, and big cities like New York got substantially redder between 2020 and 2024, said the economist Jed Kolko. He said some of the shift in already-conservative areas might be because movers wanted to go somewhere that aligned with their politics. City dwellers also may have gotten more conservative. \"The people who leave big blue cities probably don't have the same politics \u2014 or don't have exactly the same politics \u2014 as people who stay,\" Kolko said. \"And wanting to move to a community where people have similar views could be on the list of reasons why someone moves.\" Millennials and Gen Zers \u2014 both represented in that 25 to 44 group \u2014 have swung more to the right.

It\u2019s a trend that has caught the attention of the federal government, and it is promising to change the face of America. It\u2019s no secret that millennials have been moving away from big cities in droves. To many millennials, the downtown areas of major metropolises have become overcrowded, expensive, and overly commercialized. As a result, they are voting with their feet and moving to smaller cities that still offer the amenities they want, but at a lower price. But millennials aren\u2019t the only ones who have flocked to small towns. Generation Z players have also been moving away from the big cities and into smaller communities for similar reasons. Still, they have made significant changes to the communities that appeal to them, especially regarding the cost of living. Today, this trend could mean what many in Washington D.C. have anticipated: the rebuilding of small towns across America. Young people are moving to the countryside and not just going to their hometowns. In many ways, they\u2019re living the American Dream, which includes owning a home, raising a family, and investing in their community. History of the Millennial Migration It\u2019s no secret that millennials moving away from big cities began after the Great Recession. The economic downturn was so extreme that many companies were either downsizing or outsourcing for financial reasons. Furthermore, millennials had just come of age during a time of great social unrest and uncertainty. The combination of the two fueled a sense of instability and mistrust that many young people have had over the last decade and a reason for moving to the countryside.

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative.

While there are a number of advantages to growing up in a rural environment, such as wide open spaces and a tight-knit community, many young people in rural America believe that the challenges outweigh the perks. Young people who choose to relocate to urban areas are typically seeking higher wages and increased access to resources such as healthcare, education, and healthy food. The Center for American Progress reports that rural areas constitute 97 percent of America\u2019s landmass, yet those same areas are home to only about one-fifth of the national population. As such, those living in rural communities are more likely to experience poverty and have reduced access to healthy food and public transportation. Further, youth in rural America may not have as much opportunity to socialize with their peers, either in person or online. For young people living below the poverty line in rural areas, the idea of moving to the big city may be enticing. But the increased job opportunities in urban areas is only a small piece of a much larger picture when it comes to social mobility.

Ocejo April 29, 2024 One of the many trends that made headlines during the Covid-19 pandemic was people moving from large, dense cities to smaller cities, towns, and even rural areas, bypassing the suburbs. This pattern had been happening prior to 2020, of course. It accelerated during the time of lockdowns and school and office closures. People with financial means and work flexibility are the most likely to make such a move. If working-from-home was going to be the new normal, why not avoid the big city\u2019s expensive real estate and get more space and access to nature, the thinking goes. Many in the middle class have picked up and left, while the wealthy are able to buy second homes, if they want, for lifestyle flexibility.\u00a0 The story of this pattern that has become most prominent since the pandemic is the fate of large cities. The \u201curban doom loop\u201d of declining downtowns and shrinking tax revenue take up a lot of oxygen. The places that don\u2019t get as much attention are the ones that have been receiving newcomers from large cities in noticeable numbers. Small municipalities and rural towns have faced the opposite issue from large cities: instead of the fear of decline, they are experiencing a sudden resurgence of new residents, businesses, development, and investment. In many cases, this influx has revived downtowns and Main Streets that were struggling for many decades. While these sound like positive additions at first glance, even success has consequences. It\u2019s almost paradoxical that places with small populations don\u2019t get much attention in the national media or in academic research, especially when compared to metropolises. Quite simply, there are a lot more small places than large ones. Out of the approximately 20,000 incorporated places in the United States, only 311 have more than 100,000 residents, while 52% of people who live in an incorporated \u201ccity\u201d do so in one with fewer than 250,000 residents.

Crime victimization rates are higher in urban than rural areas, but despite a rise in urban violent crime victimizations reported in 2021, rates have been falling for decades. Updated on Mon, September 25, 2023 by the USAFacts Team In 2021, crime victimization rates were higher in urban than rural areas. In urban settings, 24.5 out of 1,000 people aged 12 or older reported being the victims of violent crimes, and 157.5 reported being the victims of property crimes. In rural settings, those figures were 11.1 and 57.7, respectively. How many people report being victims of crime? In 2021, more than 4.5 million violent incidents involving victims ages 12 and older were self-reported in the US in the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). In the same year, 11.7 million property victimizations were also reported, according to the Criminal Victimization report from the Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) Bureau of Justice Statistics. Despite this, US crime victimization rates have been on an overall downward trend since 1995. The DOJ tracks crime victimization data by location, which shows how trends vary for urban, suburban, and rural areas. One common narrative is that urban crime victimization rates exceed those in rural areas \u2014 and this is true, based on the data.

(AP Photo/Kiichiro Sato) (NewsNation) \u2014\u00a0Violent crime rose in urban, rural and suburban areas across the U.S. in 2022, according to the nation\u2019s largest crime survey released this month. As has historically been the case, violent crime was highest in urban areas last year, the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS) found. The violent victimization rate rose 36% in those areas from 2021 to 2022, from 24.5 to 33.4 victimizations per 1,000 persons aged 12 and older. Violent crime went up by a similar proportion in rural areas last year but remains much lower overall, increasing from 11.1 to 15.4 victimizations per 1,000 persons aged 12 and older. In suburban areas, the rate jumped from 16.5 to 23.9. Those victimization rates reflect data on nonfatal violent crimes, including rape or sexual assault, robbery, aggravated assault and simple assault. In 2022, there were 6.6 million violent victimizations of people 12 or older in the United States, up from 4.6 million the year prior, according to the survey. That total is similar to the number of violent crime victims in 2018. From 2021 to 2022, the overall violent victimization rate in the U.S. went from 16.5 to 23.5 per 1,000 persons. That\u2019s a reversal of a decades-long downward trend but still significantly lower than the victimization rate of 79.8 in 1993. The survey also includes statistics on property crimes like robbery, trespassing and motor vehicle theft. Those crimes also increased across all three geographic areas compared to the year prior. In 2022, the survey found that the property crime rate in urban areas was nearly twice as high as in suburban areas and three times higher than in rural areas. Overall, there were 13.4 million property victimizations of U.S. households last year, up fro",

Confirming widespread perceptions, the nation\u2019s largest crime survey finds that violent crime in urban areas rose dramatically from 2020 to 2021. The Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), the statistical arm of the Department of Justice, recently released findings from the 2021 National Crime Victimization Survey. According to the NCVS, which dates to the Nixon administration, the rate of violent crime rose only in urban areas. It did not change to a statistically significant degree in suburban or rural areas. The NCVS involves about a quarter of a million interviews each year with a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents. The federal government\u2019s field agents ask respondents whether they were the victim of a crime within the past six months. According to the NCVS, violent crime in urban areas rose 29 percent from 2020 to 2021, from 19.0 to 24.5 victimizations per 1,000 persons aged 12 or older. From 2018 through 2020, the NCVS found that the violent-crime rate in urban areas was between 29 percent and 42 percent higher than the rate in rural areas. In 2021, however, the violent-crime rate in urban areas was 121 percent higher, more than doubling the rate in rural areas (24.5 victimizations in urban areas, versus 11.1 in rural areas, per 1,000 persons). In addition, the violent-crime rate in urban areas was 48 percent higher in 2021 than in suburban areas, more than tripling any difference in urban and suburban rates registered from 2018 to 2020. The property-crime rate in urban areas was nearly twice as high in 2021 as in suburban areas (157.5 to 86.8 victimizations per 1,000 households) and nearly three times as high as in rural areas (157.5 to 57.7 victimizations per 1,000 households).

Violent crime rates in urban settings are notably higher, with 24.5 incidents per 1,000 people in 2021, compared to 11.1 per 1,000 in rural areas. This stark contrast extends to specific violent crimes like rape, robbery, and assault. Urban environments also see more firearm-related violent crimes. However, the property crime landscape tells a different story. Surprisingly, rural areas often experience higher rates of certain property crimes, particularly burglaries. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the key crime rate differences: | Crime Type | Urban Rate (per 1,000) | Rural Rate (per 1,000) | | --- | --- | --- | | Violent | 24.5 | 11.1 | | Property | Varies | Higher for burglaries | These statistics underscore the complex nature of criminal activity across different settings. Urban areas face greater challenges with violent crime, while rural communities grapple with specific property crime issues. Understanding these nuances is best for tailoring effective law enforcement strategies and public safety measures to each unique environment. Factors Influencing Crime in Rural Areas Rural areas face unique challenges that impact crime rates and patterns. I\u2019ve identified several key factors that contribute to criminal activity in these regions, based on my research and analysis. Socioeconomic Conditions Rural communities often grapple with economic hardships that can fuel criminal behavior. Limited job opportunities, lower income levels, and higher poverty rates create an environment where some individuals turn to illegal activities for financial gain. Substance abuse, particularly the opioid epidemic, exacerbates these issues. The lack of resources for mental health and addiction treatment in rural areas further ",

Suicide is now the second leading cause of death in these groups. Studies have revealed geographic differences in youth suicide rates. Youth living in rural areas are at greater risk of suicide than those living in urban areas. Suicide rates are also growing at a faster pace among rural youth. Access to mental health care is an important factor in reducing suicide rates. Studies have found that youth in rural counties have access to fewer mental health services than those in urban and suburban counties. But previous studies haven\u2019t examined the availability of suicide prevention services in rural areas. They\u2019ve also lacked a sophisticated way to classify how rural or urban an area is.\u00a0 A study led by Janessa Graves of Washington State University examined the nationwide distribution of mental health facilities that serve youth and offer suicide prevention services. The study was funded in part by NIH\u2019s National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD). Results were published on October 22, 2020, in JAMA Network Open. The researchers identified about 9,500 mental health facilities and determined whether they offered suicide prevention services. These included suicide screenings, treatment for suicidal thoughts, and referrals for follow-up care. The team then used each facility\u2019s zip code to classify its location as metropolitan, micropolitan (a smaller urban community), small town, or rural. Location was also rated on a scale of 1 (most urban) to 9 (most rural), based on county.

Rural areas experience a severe lack of access to and availability of the full range of behavioral health care services, challenges with mental health care workforce recruitment and retention, and technology barriers impacting telehealth visits.iv These challenges contribute to a more vulnerable and resource-poor rural population compared to urban peers.

Typically, the Committee travels to a rural part of the country to hold its meeting and to visit local providers, allowing members to hear directly from stakeholders. However, due to the COVID\u00ad 19 pandemic, the meeting was held virtually. Rural EMS agencies from different regions of the country were gathered via Zoom to create virtual site visits. Committee members were divided into two groups, one that would focus on the financial issues related to EMS service in rural areas, the other on workforce issues. These discussions helped the committee formulate this policy brief and summaries of which can be found in the Appendix.

However, in urban areas, there are still plenty who find it difficult to access the primary or specialty care they need. Delays and longer wait times are often the case in these areas as well.\u00a0 Though there\u2019s an urge to discover whether people in cities or the countryside have it better when it comes to access to medical professionals, the differences between states and the way people in both populations utilize healthcare services make a definitive winner-loser comparison impossible.\u00a0 What we can do is look at a few telling aspects of how rural medical care compares to that of cities.\u00a0 Rural Healthcare in America Before we compare urban and rural healthcare, it is important we understand both. Rural simply refers to a geographic area that is located outside of towns and cities. An urban area is the opposite, as it\u2019s an area that is built up with a high population of people and a dense infrastructure. Access to Healthcare in Rural Communities The primary issue that the rural healthcare system faces is\u202fworkforce shortage problems. Since fewer people live in these areas, the pools of qualified nurses, doctors, and specialized school professionals are drastically smaller than their urban counterparts. According to the\u202fNational Rural Health Association\u202f(NRHA)\u2014a national non-profit organization providing leadership on rural health issues through advocacy, communications, education, and research\u2014the patient-to-primary care physician ratio in rural areas is only 39.8 physicians per 100,000 people, compared to 53.3 physicians per 100,000 in urban areas.\u00a0 Additionally, the average household income in rural areas is generally less than in cities.

On average, rural residents are older and generally have worse health conditions than urban residents. But while they may require more medical attention and care, they also might have more limited access to health care. Today\u2019s WatchBlog post looks at both changes and challenges in rural health care access, as highlighted in our latest Health Care Capsule. Image \u00a0 Hospital closures and higher risks Having a local hospital or access to care is critical in an emergency situation where minutes can make a big difference. But we\u2019ve found that many rural residents are seeing their local hospital close. More than 100 (or 4% of) rural hospitals closed from 2013 through 2020. As a result, residents had to travel about 20 miles farther for common services like inpatient care, and 40 miles farther for less common services, such as alcohol or drug misuse treatment. We also found, as you might expect, that rural areas without hospitals also generally had fewer health care providers overall compared to those without closures. People had to travel farther to get health care services after rural hospitals closed in their areas Image \u00a0 In addition to losing their hospitals, rural residents might also face additional health risks. Certain populations are disproportionately affected While rural communities face access and quality of care issues\u2014we\u2019ve found that some populations face unique challenges. Pregnant people, American Indians and Alaska Natives, and veterans may struggle to access the care they need in rural areas. For example, we found that more than half of rural counties lacked hospital-based obstetric services in 2018. By 2030, the anticipated supply of OB/GYNs is expected to meet only about 50% of the demand in rural areas. In rural counties, the loss of hospital-based obstetric care is associated ",

Nearly a quarter (23%) of Americans in rural areas say this, compared with 18% of urbanites and 9% of suburbanites, according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year. One factor that may contribute to this view is that getting to a hospital is a longer trip \u2013 both in distance and time \u2013 for people in rural areas than those in suburbs and cities. Rural Americans live an average of 10.5 miles from the nearest hospital, compared with 5.6 miles for people in suburban areas and 4.4 for those in urban areas, according to a new Center analysis. Taking local traffic patterns into account, that works out to a travel time of 17 minutes for people who live in rural communities, 12 minutes for those in suburban areas and 10 minutes for those in urban areas. The analysis plots the distance from the nearest acute care facility for a representative sample of more than 10,000 U.S. adults included in the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel. (In this analysis, community types are self-described; that is, survey respondents are asked whether they live in a rural, suburban or urban area.) These findings come amid a wave of rural hospital closures in recent years that have raised concerns about access to health care. A report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office earlier this year found that 64 rural hospitals closed between 2013 and 2017, more than twice the number of rural hospital closures in the previous five-year period. Overall, 18% of Americans live more than 10 miles away from their nearest hospital, while 24% live between 5 and 10 miles away and 58% live less than 5 miles away, according to the analysis.

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative. About Youth Futures Foundation Youth Futures Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation established with a \u00a390m endowment from the Reclaim Fund to improve employment outcomes for young people from marginalised backgrounds.

Our understanding of how it can be best addressed is limited. This systematic review aims to assess the acceptability and effectiveness of interventions to reduce and prevent loneliness and social isolation in young people. Methods: Six bibliographic databases were searched; references of included studies were screened for relevant literature. A pre-defined framework was used for data extraction. Quality appraisal was performed using the Mixed Method Appraisal Tool. Data were synthesised narratively. Results: 9,358 unique references were identified; 28 publications from 16 interventions met the inclusion criteria. The majority of interventions were high intensity, individual or small group interventions, often targeted at specific 'at risk' populations. While 14 interventions were associated with a statistically significant reduction in loneliness or social isolation, the heterogeneous measures of loneliness, small sample sizes, short periods of follow-up and high attrition rates limit evidence on ef",

Even before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, approximately half of people in the US reported experiencing measurable levels of loneliness. Despite localized and select cross-sectional studies highlighting even higher increases in isolation/loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic, additional research is needed, particularly for youth and young adults. This work examines patterns of isolation/loneliness across the US from 2016 to 2022 among individuals aged 24 and younger. Our study leverages a unique dataset, Crisis Text Line, which provides complete spatiotemporal coverage of crisis conversations in the US. We conducted a geospatial analysis using Kuldroff\u2019s Space\u2013Time SatScan to identify statistically significant clustering of elevated isolation/loneliness-related conversations. The statistical significance of spatiotemporal clusters was determined using Monte Carlo simulations (n\u2009=\u20099999).

Millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers are leaving big cities for small-town life. Since 2014, around 30,000 city dwellers aged 24-40 have fled the city rat race yearly for small towns.\u00a0 The pandemic accelerated this trend of young people moving to small towns in their 20s and 30s. CNBC reports 32% of Gen Z and 26% of millennials relocated to smaller towns and rural areas during the pandemic. Key reasons include being closer to family/friends (31%), more affordable living (27%), or working remotely (17%). Let's dive deeper into why young people move to small towns: \u00a0 REASONS YOUNG PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO SMALL TOWNS Peasley Boise Movers cites several driving factors: Less Stressful Life The sheer volume of people, energy, and city hustle adds stress to everything. Add kids, and getting anywhere becomes far more difficult. Small towns avoid this. Lower Cost of LivingHousing, entertainment, groceries, parking - almost everything costs more in cities. Childcare alone \u00a0can be nearly as much as a mortgage payment. Paying $18 for a burger, $500 monthly for two parking spots, or $250 for a haircut/color leaves little savings room. Many millennials, younger Gen Xers, and older Gen Zers in their 20s and 30s aim to buy houses and start families. But this dream may be out of reach in the city, despite good incomes. The culprit? Crushing student debt. According to the Education Data Initiative, in 2021, federal student loan debt topped out at $1.57 trillion, with Gen X carrying an average of $45,095 per person and Millennials $38,877 on average. Gen Z's averages $17,388 so far. Burdened by debt, these young people can't afford the city home prices. But in small towns, they suddenly get more house and land tha",

Since the pandemic, cities with more than 1 million residents have lost adults ages 25 to 44 while towns with smaller populations have gained young people, after accounting for both those moving in and leaving, according to a University of Virginia analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. \u201cYounger adults have driven most of the shift towards small towns and rural areas since the pandemic,\u201d said Hamilton Lombard, the study's author and a demographer at the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. It\u2019s no surprise that the health crisis fueled a migration of many Americans young and old to less populated areas with lower risk of contagion. But even as fears around COVID-19 have eased significantly, the endurance of the remote work shift sparked by the crisis and lower costs in smaller metro areas have continued to encourage young Americans to move to rural communities, Lombard said.

The trend, if it persists, could further dampen the vibrancy of large cities already diminished by the COVID-19 crisis while enhancing the economic viability of small towns. When did people start moving to big cities? After declining in the 1960s and 1970s, large cities were rejuvenated in the 1980s and 1990s by the tendency of white-collar industries to cluster there to benefit from better communication and networking and by young professionals attracted to both the jobs and social and cultural amenities. Since 1980, 80% of the growth of the nation\u2019s under-45 population has occurred in metro areas with more than 1 million residents, according to Lo",

[+] technologies. If you consider that the Internet really starting showing its anywhere access, innovative business models and infrastructure potential in the year 2000 or so, then why did we need a pandemic to fuel a remote work trend? Entrepreneurs for years have been building cloud-based technologies and services which allowed for anywhere, anytime access. So why is remote work becoming such a hot topic today with employers saying come back to work and employees indicating they want to work remotely? This combination of technology and desire for a better lifestyle will drive the increase of entrepreneurship in small towns. Why? It\u2019s a combination of generational changes, lifestyle and angst. One of the biggest generational changes affecting both the Millennials and Gen Z populations is technology and social media and its impact on their communication skills. According to an insightful article on communication by Flexjobs, the way these two generations communicate is completely different than say Gen X or Baby Boomers. Over time, they have transitioned from in-person communications from previous generations to email, text, and emojis. And with that transition comes a difference in how the generations communicate at work. The lack of face to face communication skills has affected company culture, loyalty and fueled additional angst. Throw in an appreciation for living and traveling well and you can see why these two generations are both beautifully disruptive. And they are moving.

The findings, based on survey responses from a global panel that included adolescents and young adults, provide a set of priorities that city planners can adopt to build urban environments that are safe, equitable, and inclusive. To determine city characteristics that could bolster youth mental health, researchers administered an initial survey to a panel of more than 400, including young people and a multidisciplinary group of researchers, practitioners, and advocates. Through two subsequent surveys, participants prioritized six characteristics that would support young city dwellers' mental health: opportunities to build life skills; age-friendly environments that accept young people's feelings and values; free and safe public spaces where young people can connect; employment and job security; interventions that address the social determinants of health; and urban design with youth input and priorities in mind. The paper was published online February 21 in Nature. The study's lead author is Pamela Collins, MD, MPH, chair of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health's Department of Mental Health. The study was conducted while Collins was on the faculty at the University of Washington. The paper was written by an international, interdisciplinary team, including citiesRISE, a global nonprofit that works to transform mental health policy and practice in cities, especially for young people. Cities have long been a draw for young people. Research by UNICEF projects that cities will be home to 70 percent of the world's children by 2050.

Increasing urbanization over the next three decades will be accompanied by a growing population of children and adolescents living in cities3. Shaping the aspects of urban life that influence youth mental health could have an enormous impact on adolescent well-being and adult trajectories4. We invited a multidisciplinary, global group of researchers, practitioners, advocates and young people to complete sequential surveys to identify and prioritize the characteristics of a mental health-friendly city for young people. Here we show a set of ranked characteristic statements, grouped by personal, interpersonal, community, organizational, policy and environmental domains of intervention. Life skills for personal development, valuing and accepting young people\u2019s ideas and choices, providing safe public space for social connection, employment and job security, centring youth input in urban planning and design, and addressing adverse social determinants were priorities by domain. We report the adversities that COVID-19 generated and link relevant actions to these data. Our findings highlight the need for intersectoral, multilevel intervention and for inclusive, equitable, participatory design of cities that support youth mental health.

With this difference among rural and urban males on anxiety & stress and difference among rural and urban females on anxiety and stress were also identified. The sample consisted of 200 participants having 100 males (50 urban and 50 rural) and 100 females (50 urban and 50 rural). They were selected randomly from various colleges of Patiala district. The obtained data was analyzed by using t-test. Results revealed significant gender difference in stress level but there was no significant difference in anxiety. Besides that significant difference were found among rural and urban females on anxiety and as well as on stress but surprisingly no such significant difference was seen among rural and urban males on anxiety and stress. Thus, the youth especially females are in need of psychological support to cope with these difficulties as it rightly said that when you teach a man, you teach a single person but when you teach a woman you teach whole family. So they should be intervened with specially designed life skills programs for holistic development. Keywords: Rural, Urban, Anxiety, Stress and Young Adults I.

                      "raw_content": " Are big cities bad for our mental health? Research accumulated by the Centre for Urban Design and Mental Health confirms it: People living in big cities are far more susceptible to mental illnesses than those living in more quiet, rural areas. Specifically, city-dwellers are almost 40% more likely to suffer from depression and other mood disorders and twice as likely to develop schizophrenia. For decades, psychologists, philosophers, and urban planners have hypothesized as to why urban environments could be associated with poor mental health. During this time, many viable explanations have been brought forth. For one, city-dwellers are routinely placed in emotional states that eat away at their psychological wellbeing, such as stress, isolation, and uncertainty. How exactly city life brings out these conditions is not at all clear. While some people move to the city in search of opportunity, others do so to escape intolerable conditions such as war, poverty, or abuse. Rather than curing their neuroses, however, the perils and pitfalls of city life may actually have the adverse effect of exacerbating them. At the same time, there seems to be something about cities that brings out the worst in people regardless of whether they arrived with predetermined trauma in tow. One of the academic texts which comes closest to describing this \u201csomething\u201d is \u201cThe Metropolis and Mental Life,\u201d an essay that was published in 1903 and written by the German sociologist Georg Simmel. Georg Simmel and the blas\u00e9 outlook Growing up in the burgeoning metropolis of Berlin during the so-called Belle \u00c9poque, Georg Simmel did not share his contemporaries\u2019 unwavering belief in civilization. Where others saw society as continuously improving with the help of science and commerce, Simmel could not help but feel as though humanity had taken a wrong turn and was now paying for its mistake. Simmel attempted to elucidate this position in \u201cThe Metropolis,\u201d which originally came into being as a lecture for Dresden\u2019s First German Municipal Expositio",

While urban environments offer significant advantages, including better access to healthcare, nutrition, and sanitation, they also introduce a host of stressors that can impact mental well-being. This article explores the complex relationship between urban living and mental health, highlighting the areas most affected and the environmental factors contributing to this issue. The Urbanization Phenomenon Currently, more than half of the world\u2019s population resides in urban areas, a figure expected to rise to 70% by 2050. This shift is most pronounced in low- and middle-income countries, although high-income regions like North America and Europe have already reached high levels of urbanization. While urban living comes with its set of benefits, such as increased wealth and better living conditions, it also poses unique challenges, particularly in densely populated cities and slums, where about one billion people worldwide live. City dwellers face multiple environmental stressors not as prevalent in rural settings. Two of the most significant culprits are air pollution and noise, both of which have been linked to an increased risk of depression. Urban environments can be intensely demanding and stressful, with greater spatial divides and social disparities further exacerbating the situation. Being raised in city environments, particularly in the first 15 years of life, might change the brain in ways that could increase the likelihood of mental health issues. The Neuroscience Perspective Recent research has started to uncover how city life might influence our brains, especially in the parts that deal with our emotions, how we understand others, and how we handle stress. For example, living in a city has been linked to changes in the amygdala, a ",

She is interested in researching life course risk factors of various mental health problems in childhood, adolescence and young adulthood as well as ways to improve access to mental health services. Jennifer Dykxhoorn is a PhD student in the PsyLife Lab, Division of Psychiatry, UCL. Her research focuses on social and spatial determinants of psychotic disorders. She has a background in public mental health policy, having previously worked for the Public Health Agency of Canada and Mental Health Commission of Canada. Dr James Kirkbride is a Reader in Epidemiology in the Division of Psychiatry, UCL. He specialises in investigating the determinants of excess risk of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders experienced by urban populations and ethnic minority groups. He runs the PsyLife group (www.PsyLife.eu) in the Division of Psychiatry, UCL. Abstract In this chapter we review the evidence for rural-urban and spatial variation of three major sets of mental health disorders: schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders; common mental disorders including depression and anxiety, and; suicide. For each, we review the recent literature which has addressed these issues and report the main strengths and limitations of the available evidence. The most consistent evidence for rural-urban gradients in mental health risk are found to exist for schizophrenia and suicide, with more mixed evidence in relation to common mental disorders. For schizophrenia and suicide we go onto review the majo",

The motivations for rural-to-urban migration typically include economic and educational opportunities, but migrants \u2013 most of whom are young adults \u2013 may also move for personal reasons. Leaving the family home affords increased autonomy and anonymity, especially amidst the more permissive social norms in the city versus the village. The relationship between rural-to-urban migration and health involves three key mechanisms. First, the health status of migrants may differ from that of their non-migrant counterparts at origin before they move. Indeed, a healthy migrant phenomenon has been empirically shown. Second, rural-to-urban migration may affect physical and mental health status, because migrants are exposed to new risks and benefits in urban destinations. Finally, health status may determine which migrants stay at destination and which return to origin: less healthy migrants may be more likely to return. This selection mechanism has been called \u201csalmon bias\u201d in the literature, but we label it \u201cMidnight Train\u201d effect due to the apt description in the song\u2019s lyrics about a musician who moved from his native Georgia to Los Angeles to become a \u201csuperstar, but he didn\u2019t get far\u201d and decides to \u201cgo back to the life he once knew.\u201d Differentiating these three mechanisms presents formidable methodological challenges for studying the impact of migration on health. A longitudinal research design makes it possible to ascertain selection effects of rural-to-urban migration and return migration, and also to observe changes in health status that occur from pre- to post-migration.

Several studies have reported that youth who experience mental health disorders are also at a greater risk of developing psychopathological conditions later in life, suggesting that the ability of researchers and clinicians to identify mental health problems early in life may help prevent adult psychopathology. Using large-scale administrative data, this study examined whether permanent settlement and within-province migration patterns may be linked to mental health diagnoses among adolescents (15 to 19 years old), young adults (20 to 30 years old), and adults (30 years old and older) who grew up in rural or urban communities or migrated between types of community (N = 8,502).

However, few studies have estimated separate effects of birth-cohort and ageing and examined the role of community resources on health inequalities. Methods: Drawing data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (2011-2018), this study employed multilevel modelling to identify the mental health trajectories of rural, peri-urban, urban older adults by cohort and the community effects. Results: The changes in the mental health gap between rural, peri-urban and urban older adults over time varied by birth cohorts. Among younger cohorts aged under 65, the mental health disparities between rural, peri-urban and urban residents increased as they got older. Underdeveloped community infrastructure greatly explained the rural health disadvantage. Conclusion: The study indicates increasing rural-urban health disparities at the onset of later life. Improving community infrastructure in rural and peri-urban areas is vital to minimise rural-urban health gaps. Keywords: Cumulative inequality; age vector graphs; ageing effe",

Abstract Rural adolescents are transitioning to adulthood in the context of growing disparities. To advance research on the social, behavioral, and contextual factors that influence rural young adult development, this study conducted a scoping review. The review sought to identify how researchers defined rural and how/which theories guided their work; how they integrated the rural context into the research design and methods; and how they used variables, concepts, and outcomes to measure rural experiences. Included articles were published between January 2009 and November 2020, included young adults ages 18\u201329, measured adult role achievement and/or behavioral health outcomes and reported on these outcomes for young adults, and focused on a rural sample within the United States. A systematic search of four databases resulted in 25 empirical articles for the inductive, qualitative analysis. Most studies used atheoretical approaches focusing on outcomes related to adult social roles, substance use, and mental health. Five themes emerged focused on the definitions of r",

Rural to urban migration may lead to increase in crime rates, unemployment, environmental pollution and limited access to social amenities. In addition, it also affects the agricultural productivity in rural areas due to workforce reductions. People migrate from rural areas to urban areas in search of better employment opportunities, education and better living conditions. This movement is encouraged by the perceived large number of employment and business opportunities in urban areas. The following are some of the effects of rural to urban migration. Effects of Rural to Urban Migration in Urban Areas Unemployment: Increased movement of people from rural areas results in a surplus workforce in the urban areas. In this regard, many of those migrating are left unemployed. Moreover, due to the surplus workforce, employers tend to pay low wages, which may force their employees into harsh economic situations. Poor sanitation: Rural to urban migration may lead to overcrowding in urban areas. Overcrowding causes an increase in demand for low-cost housing for both the poorly paid employees and the unemployed, resulting in the emergence of informal settlements and slums. As observed in many third world countries, such slums lack proper sanitation, which exposes residents to diseases like cholera. Increase in crime rates: Unemployment resulting from surplus labor in urban areas is one of the contributing factors for crime in inner city areas. Some unemployed youth join gangs and other organized crime syndicates in order to make ends meet. Moreover, unemployment in urban areas contributes to several social ills, such as drug abuse and prostitution. Environmental pollution: Rural to urban migration may lead to overcrowding of urban areas, which often results in increased motor vehicle emissions, industrial pollution and improper waste disposal. In addition, without proper planning, increasing urban populations may lead to stretched utility ",

Almost 80 percent of the population in the United States lives in an urban area. This number shows no sign of declining, as people move from rural areas to cities, often in search of better job opportunities. This pattern of migration affects not only the often-overcrowded urban areas, but the rural areas that people leave behind. Infrastructure Challenges The movement of people from rural areas to urban areas, whether in the U.S. or elsewhere, can put a strain on a city's infrastructure. Roads and freeways become overcrowded as new construction struggles to keep up with the demand. Wait time at emergency rooms can become a public health issue as hospitals may not be equipped to handle the increase in population. Schools may not have the budget to hire additional personnel or build new buildings, which can lead to overcrowding in classrooms. Overcrowding As the population density of urban areas increases, so do the signs of overcrowding. Real estate prices often go up as demand outpaces the supply of housing. This can lead to individuals living in small spaces with several other people, leading to the rise of slums. Urban overcrowding can also place severe financial strain on people who have lived in the area for years, but who must cope with rapidly rising rents. As the number of cars on urban streets increases, so does the pollution that is emitted, which can cause the public health problem of increased respiratory disease among the population. Overcrowding can also increase stress levels, as people deal with having less physical space and quiet in their environment. Family Structure As many people, especially young adults, leave rural areas for the cities, they leave family behind. As a result, extended family systems begin to disintegrate. The result is often a lack of childcare and eldercare for family members. As younger people leave rural areas, marriage prospects for young adults who decide to stay can decline. If rural ",

The lack of remittances and alternative arrangements for caring for the migrant children\u2019s elderly parents, as well as the lack of social support networks, makes it difficult for them to cope on their own. The purpose of this study is to ascertain how the migration of younger adults affects the well-being of the left-behind older parents in Nsukka LGA, Enugu State, and to recommend ways to improve their living conditions. Twenty-four elderly parents were purposively chosen for the study. An in-depth interview method was employed for data collection. Using themes and quotes, the generated data were transcribed and analyzed. According to the study, young adults migrate to cities due to poverty, lack of employment and business opportunities, poor hospitals and schools, and lack of social amenities in rural areas. The study also discovered that elderly parents who are left behind in rural areas face hardship and neglect. As a result, to discourage unnecessary migration, we advocated for massive and aggressive rural infrastructure development. Furthermore, social workers should be involved in advocating for elderly social support systems. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative. About Youth Futures Foundation Youth Futures Foundation is an independent, not-for-profit organisation established with a \u00a390m endowment from the Reclaim Fund to improve employment outcomes for young people from marginalised backgrounds. Our aim is to narrow employment gaps by identifying what works and why, investing in evidence generation and innovation, and igniting a movement for change. 2.

This policy brief uses data from interviews with 22 key informants in 12 states, all of whom were experts in the issue of social isolation and/or rural health, to describe key chal\u00ad lenges and opportunities related to rural social isolation. Background and Policy Context Social isolation encompasses objective lack of social contact, or social disconnectedness, as well as more subjective feelings of loneliness, both of which affect health.1 It is directly related to increased morbidity and mortality, both of which are elevated in rural areas, compared with urban areas.2,3 In fact, recent research shows that social isolation poses as great of a risk to mortality as obesity and smoking.4,5 Social isolation has been linked to increased health care costs,6 and with a variety of poor health outcomes, including increased risk of high blood pressure, stress, sub\u00ad stance use, depression, suicide, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, as well as dimin\u00ad ished immune system functioning.7 Given the geographic and spatial aspects of social isolation as well as the uniqueness of rural communities and life experiences, specific at\u00ad tention should be paid to social isolation in rural areas. Rural-tailored information could inform effective intervention strategies to increase so\u00ad cial connection in these communities. However, research on rural-urban differences in social isolation is limited and more information is needed regarding effective strategies to inform policy-making. This policy brief addresses gaps in the literature and provides policy-relevant information by identifying key issues in rural social isolation and potential opportu\u00ad nities to intervene, based on interviews with rural stakeholders who are actively working on issues related t",

A combination of physical barriers in the built environment and rapidly-occurring global trends has resulted in the exclusion of large cohorts of the world\u2019s population. However, there is hope. If we focus on understanding the needs of urban populations, particularly those who are vulnerable, we can build inclusive cities. Using existing programs and policies as models, this paper aims to demonstrate how we can diminish social isolation and build social connectedness through human-centered, inclusive urban planning. 1. Social Isolation and Urbanization More than half of the global population now lives in cities, and the United Nations predicts this number will increase to two-thirds by 2050.1 The rise in urban dwellers may be conducive to human development, as \u201ccities can offer better access to basic services and more job opportunities \u2026 [and] can spur efficiency and innovation.\u201d 2 Furthermore, cities are \u201coften hubs of intellectual and cultural richness.\u201d3 However, rapid and unplanned urban growth is also linked to \u201cpoverty, environment degradation, and population demands that outstrip service capacity.\u201d4 The increase in urban populations is thus one of the most pressing global issues today. 1 Kim Samuel, \u201cBuilding for Belonging,\u201d Resurgence, 2015. 2 Ibid. 3 Ibid. 4 Jitendra K.

To date, there have been few studies examining rural-urban differences in loneliness among adults in the United States. We examined differences in loneliness across the rural-urban continuum among adult residents living in Washington State. Methods: Stratified random sampling was used to select 2,575 adults from small rural, large rural, suburban, and urban areas who were invited to complete a survey on factors affecting health. Data were obtained from 616 adults (278 from small rural, 100 from large rural, 98 from suburban, and 140 from urban areas) from June 2018 through October 2019. Loneliness was measured using the UCLA Loneliness Scale (3rd version). Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were used to examine geographic differences in loneliness (measured continuously and dichotomously). Findings: Mean unadjusted loneliness scores were lower in suburban compared to urban areas (35.06 vs 38.57, P = .03).

Its effects can impact nearly all aspects of daily living, including physical health, as well as increase the risk of developing conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, and other illnesses.i Americans have experienced a sharp increase in mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic.ii The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s 2019 National Survey on Drug Use and Health reported one in five U.S. adults experienced mental illness each year.iii Data obtained by the National Center for Health Statistics, in partnership with the U.S. Census Bureau on the 2020-2021 Household Pulse Survey, reported anxiety and depression rates among adults as high as 42 percent during the pandemic.iv While rates of mental illness are similar in rural areas compared to urban areas, there is a higher risk of suicide in rural communities, with nearly twice as many suicides in the most rural counties compared to urban.v In 2018, data from the National Vital Statistics System reported male and female rural and urban disparities, with the rural male suicide rate (30.7 per 100,000) higher than the urban male suicide rate (21.5 per 100,000) and the rural female suicide rate (8.0 per 100,000) higher than the urban rate (5.9 per 100,000).vi Additional research is needed to better understand the higher risk of suicide in rural areas, including the influence of rural culture, geographic isolation, limited services, and education. Rural areas experience a severe lack of access to and availability of the full range of behavioral health care services, challenges with mental health care workforce recruitment and retention, and technology barriers impacting telehealth visits.iv These challenges contribute to a more vulnerable and resource-poor rural population compared to urban peers.

In addition, 1.6 million, or 4.8%, of adults in nonmetropolitan areas reported having serious thoughts of suicide during the year. While the prevalence of mental illness is similar between rural and urban residents, the services available can be very different. Mental healthcare needs are often not met in many rural communities across the country because adequate services are not present. Providing mental health services can be challenging in rural areas. According to the National Rural Health Association, the following factors are particular challenges to the provision of mental health services in rural communities: This topic guide focuses on mental health in rural areas and helps health and human services providers in their efforts to develop, maintain, and expand mental health services in rural communities. It also highlights challenges and important issues in mental healthcare delivery, such as workforce shortages, access issues, anonymity, stigma, integration of mental health services into primary care, and suicide prevention.

As members of small, close-knit communities, many rural individuals are also often concerned about a lack of privacy about their mental health conditions. Additional factors that impact mental health in rural America include: Ending the Stigma in Rural Communities The stigma associated with mental health conditions is a major barrier to seeking help for many individuals in rural communities. Although mental health is important to overall health, some people don\u2019t recognize mental health conditions as valid health issues. This type of thinking is often more common in rural communities, where a mental health condition can be seen as a personal weakness or character flaw, which adds shame to the struggles of someone already dealing with a mental health condition. Understanding that mental health conditions are valid health issues \u2013 just like cancer or diabetes \u2013 is one step towards eliminating the stigma in rural communities. In addition, talking openly with others about lived experiences with mental health conditions, as well as providing support to those who are struggling, are essential to breaking down the mental health stigma.

Access to available clinicians may require traveling long distances, making attendance at sessions more challenging. Digital mental health interventions (DMHIs), which use web and mobile applications to support patients and clinicians through the remote delivery of mental health services to manage mental disorders,3 offer a potential solution to address these barriers and increase access to mental health care, and may be particularly acceptable and beneficial for individuals living in rural areas. Given their efficacy and growing evidence of cost-effectiveness,3 DMHIs can expand the capacity and reach of health care settings to manage mental health. With proper privacy policies, DMHIs can provide anonymity in the use of services, which can reduce concerns around stigma and disclosure and promote engagement.4 The availability of DMHIs outside brick-and-mortar settings reduces barriers associated with accessing services.

The report presents new, dynamic frameworks for accelerating progress toward closing the $170 billion smallholder financing gap. Recognizing the critical role they play in rural economies, the research included deep dives on engaging both\u00a0women\u00a0and\u00a0youth\u00a0in achieving inclusive agricultural transformation. In this blog, we share key learnings from the youth deep dive.\u00a0 A NOTE ON COVID-19:\u00a0 The emergence of COVID-19 in the past three months has the potential to dramatically affect young people\u2019s transitions due to: (1) a loss of employment, (2) a return to on-farm activities, and (3) shifting household dynamics as a result of illness in the family.\u00a0 While we don\u2019t directly address these dynamics in this piece, the youth deep dive provides a stong baseline from which to consider how COVID-19 will likely affect rural youth.\u00a0 Over the coming months, the Lab in collaboration with ISF Advisors will be launching an Emergency Briefing Series on COVID-19 which will consider rural youth livelihoods. The global youth challenge Of the 1.2 billion young people (aged 15-24 years) in the world, 1 billion live in developing countries. About\u00a0half of this youth population\u00a0resides in rural areas. Despite shrinking population growth rates across the globe, in low-income countries the youth population is growing rapidly. This is the largest demographic challenge and opportunity of our time. While more young people are seeking to enter the workforce, youth unemployment is\u00a0three times higher\u00a0than it is for older adults. For youth in rural areas, agriculture is still the primary source of employment\u2014though mainly informal.

While there are a number of advantages to growing up in a rural environment, such as wide open spaces and a tight-knit community, many young people in rural America believe that the challenges outweigh the perks. Young people who choose to relocate to urban areas are typically seeking higher wages and increased access to resources such as healthcare, education, and healthy food. The Center for American Progress reports that rural areas constitute 97 percent of America\u2019s landmass, yet those same areas are home to only about one-fifth of the national population. As such, those living in rural communities are more likely to experience poverty and have reduced access to healthy food and public transportation. Further, youth in rural America may not have as much opportunity to socialize with their peers, either in person or online.\u00a0 For young people living below the poverty line in rural areas, the idea of moving to the big city may be enticing. But the increased job opportunities in urban areas is only a small piece of a much larger picture when it comes to social mobility. Researchers have found several key factors that support the economic advancement of young people, including strong support systems and creative solutions for accessing opportunities. Geographic location, therefore, doesn\u2019t necessarily correlate with career and economic opportunities, and a rural lifestyle may prove to be more advantageous than challenging for young Americans. Life in an American Food Desert\u00a0 In metropolitan America, access to both food and the Internet is often taken for granted.

About this brief NPC conducted a light-touch literature review focused on the challenges faced by young people in rural areas. Our research also aimed to identify evidence-based interventions that can effectively enhance the mental well-being of rural youth and improve their access to training and employment opportunities. In this brief paper, we present key findings from a substantial body of research that sheds light on the unique challenges faced by young people growing up in rural areas. Additionally, we provide insights into the existing but limited evidence available on effective approaches to supporting this demographic to access education, training and employment. The Youth Futures Foundation (YFF) funded this review as part of an evaluation capacity-building project delivered in partnership by Ipsos and NPC. The project involved the provision of evaluation capacity building support to organisations that help young people to access training and employment. Originally tailored for a YFF-funded organisation, this review has been adapted to cater to a broader audience of researchers and practitioners. It is one among several learning outputs from the capacity-building project, which aim to capture and share knowledge and insights from the initiative.

Consequently, the types and levels of assets that rural Americans have could result in them missing out on owning certain financial instruments that may help them better build wealth. This Issue Brief examines the financial situations of Americans who live in urban areas vs. those who do not live in these areas (rural) by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation from the U.S. Census Bureau. The net result is that rural individuals appear to be missing out on certain financial assets, which over the long term have provided much higher rates of return than many other investments. Other means to access the financial markets may be necessary. In addition, rural business owners appear to have their assets highly concentrated in their businesses, which could be out of necessity to run their businesses. However, a better diversification of assets could help protect these individuals\u2019 retirement prospects if something caused the business to close. One clear commonality is that banks seem to be the economic base of most individuals, including those living in rural areas. Better understanding of how banks are being used by rural individuals may allow for an increase in the ownership of other assets for these individuals. 901 D Street, SW, Suite 802, Washington, DC 20024Phone: (202) 659-0670 | Fax: (202) 775-6360 | info@ebri.org Copyright \u00a9 1996 - 2017\u00a0Employee Benefit Research Institute.

THE GLOBAL YOUTH CHALLENGE For years, changing demographics have created unprecedented numbers of under-employed youth in rural areas. Engaging these youth in agriculture and other livelihoods strategies is of critical importance. Of the 1.2 billion young people (aged 15-24 years) in the world, 1 billion live in developing countries. The youth population in these countries is growing faster than in higher income countries. In many parts of the world, despite decreasing overall population growth rates, the number of youth entering (or seeking to enter) the workforce is growing rapidly in absolute terms.1 About half of this youth population resides in rural areas\u2014where they make up a larger share of the overall populace than in urban areas.2 Both within and outside of agriculture, youth face challenges. Globally, youth unemployment is three times higher than for older adults, and youth are more likely to be underemployed or employed in part-time, seasonal, low-paying, and/or precarious jobs than older adults.3 Youth unemployment in sub-Saharan Africa, North Africa, the Middle East, South Asia, East Asia, Latin America, and Eastern and Central Europe remained the same or increased between 2010 and 2018; in OECD member countries, youth unemployment decreased by 5% during this same period.4 As the share of the youth population ",

Young professionals often have a range of options and opportunities they can choose from, which can play a significant role in where they live. Changing urban settings and lifestyle choices often play a big role in a young professional\u2019s life when deciding where to live. While many of these professionals inhabit big cities where they may have more opportunities and better access to amenities, many decide to leave these cities for smaller towns. Here are 22 reasons why young professionals are leaving big cities for small towns: Housing Costs 22 Reasons Why Young Professionals Are Leaving Big Cities for Small Towns Housing costs in big cities are continually growing, which impacts many young professionals. These people often spend a large portion of their monthly income to cover housing costs, which leaves them with little left to cover other expenses and contribute to their savings fund. The rise in the\u00a0cost of rentals makes it difficult for many professionals. It lowers the possibility of city homeownership and drives many people to leave big cities for smaller towns. Remote Work Over the years, more and more remote work opportunities have opened up, allowing young professionals to live anywhere they want while earning an income from a company based in a big city. Remote work enables these professionals to move to areas that enable them to spend less and live in an area of their choosing while maintaining a big city job. Affordability Another contributing factor to the change in location from big cities to smaller towns among many young professionals is affordability. Smaller towns often offer more affordable costs for amenities and utilities, including water bills, groceries, etc., which can significantly lower the cost of living.

Two days, tops. But when it comes to an entirely different kind of donut \u2014 one that Stanford economist Nicholas Bloom described early in the pandemic when he measured the exodus of people from city centers to city suburbs \u2014 there appears to be no expiration date. That\u2019s the key takeaway of Bloom\u2019s research of the \u201cdonut effect,\u201d a term he helped coin that refers to the hollowing out of big-city financial districts, the rising attraction of surrounding areas, and the impacts on local economies. Since the pandemic, the country\u2019s 12 largest cities have cumulatively lost 8% of their downtown dwellers. Three-fifths of the households that left moved to nearby suburbs, according to the study, which was published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). Bloom also finds a steep drop in the number of businesses located in the business centers of these major metro areas, which include New York, Boston, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Meanwhile, the donut effects for other U.S. cities have either been much smaller or haven\u2019t happened at all. For policymakers and business leaders in large urban centers, the study results may come as a surprise given widespread perceptions that their downtown economies are bouncing back to pre-pandemic health. But Bloom and his co-authors \u2014 using rich data on real estate demand, migration flows, commuting patterns, public transit use, and consumer spending \u2014 conclude that\u2019s not happening.

The sociologist David Farrugia has described this as the \u201cmetrocentricity of youth\u201d.

This generation, born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, is known for its preference for experiences over material possessions and a desire to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. As a result, many young people are leaving urban areas in search of a slower pace of life and closer connection with nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has also played a role in accelerating this trend as remote work becomes more common and people seek out less crowded environments. While this shift away from cities may have significant impacts on urban economies, it represents an opportunity for rural communities to thrive and attract new residents. Reasons Why Gen Z Is Leaving Cities There are several reasons why Gen Z is leaving cities for the countryside. One of the main factors is the high cost of living in urban areas, particularly in terms of housing. Many young people are struggling to afford rent or mortgages, and find that they can get more for their money by moving to rural areas. Additionally, there is a growing desire among young people for a simpler, more sustainable lifestyle. This often involves growing their own food, living off the land, and being closer to nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated this trend as many young people have been able to work remotely and no longer feel tied to city locations for employment opportunities. Ultimately, Gen Z\u2019s move towards rural living reflects a desire for affordability, sustainability and freedom. The Advantages Of Living In The Countryside For Gen Z, the advantages of living in the countryside are manifold. Firstly, it offers a slower pace of life, which can be a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of city living. This can be particularly beneficial for those who struggle with anxiety or stress-related issues. Secondly, there is greater a",

Now, they\u2019re leaving big metro areas in droves and powering growth in small towns and rural areas. Since the pandemic, cities with more than 1 million residents have lost adults ages 25 to 44 while towns with smaller populations have gained young people, after accounting for both those moving in and leaving, according to a University of Virginia analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. \u201cYounger adults have driven most of the shift towards small towns and rural areas since the pandemic,\u201d said Hamilton Lombard, the study's author and a demographer at the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. It\u2019s no surprise that the health crisis fueled a migration of many Americans young and old to less populated areas with lower risk of contagion. But even as fears around COVID-19 have eased significantly, the endurance of the remote work shift sparked by the crisis and lower costs in smaller metro areas have continued to encourage young Americans to move to rural communities, Lombard said. \u201cThe migration of younger adults into small towns and rural areas picked up last year rather than returning to pre-pandemic trends,\u201d he said.

In smaller cities, startups standout due to the innovative aspect of their businesses. Innovation often creates curiosity in a smaller community, resulting in interest from local stakeholders, which then results in open doors and easier access to capital. Small cities have sought for several years to develop vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems that can help them compete with larger cities for talent and companies, resulting in dense networks of active local support organizations eager to help startups succeed. 2.

A recent study by MoneyRates.com found that smaller cities have a lot to offer young entrepreneurs who launch their startups outside of major hubs like San Francisco, New York and Chicago. That's because big cities are more likely to take entrepreneurship for granted while smaller cities typically offer incentives that make life as an entrepreneur easier and more attractive. Although Texas, Florida, North Carolina, Colorado and South Dakota rank the highest on MoneyRates' list, there are plenty of other states that welcome entrepreneurs.

Relationships tend to be more personal and enduring. Lower Cost of Living: Generally, small towns offer a lower cost of living compared to big cities. Housing, transportation, and everyday expenses are often more affordable, allowing residents to save more money or allocate resources to other priorities. Less Traffic and Pollution: Small towns are characterized by less traffic congestion and lower pollution levels. Commutes are usually shorter and less stressful, contributing to a slower and more relaxed pace of life.

As a young entrepreneur, making your mark in a competitive industry can be a daunting task. There's a unique set of challenges that come with launching and scaling a business at a young age. My own journey of founding an agency at age 18 required a blend of innovative strategies, relentless perseverance and a deep understanding of the digital landscape. In this article, I'm going to share some of the top challenges that I faced while starting my business and how you can overcome them. I hope these reflections serve as a guide for other young entrepreneurs aiming to carve out their own success stories in the business world. 1. Overcoming Client Skepticism And Perceived Inexperience When I started my agency, I faced the challenge of convincing older, more experienced clients in a competitive market. I overcame skepticism by combining professionalism, my specialized knowledge and the successful outcomes of my early clients to build a solid reputation. Establishing trust and credibility is crucial in business, especially when you don't have a substantial track record. I found that leveraging my industry-specific knowledge was key to gaining the trust of older real estate agents. You can do this by sharing your insights during conversations to help bridge the age gap. After securing initial clients, showcasing their success stories is essential. These case studies are powerful in attracting new clients, serving as concrete evidence of your business's effectiveness. 2. Selling Services Online In the beginning, my agency targeted U.S. and Canadian real estate companies while being based in the United Kingdom. Convincing clients through online meetings posed a challenge. Effective strategies to help sell services online include using case studies and comparable examples of your previous clients as proof of your success potential.

Young professionals often have a range of options and opportunities they can choose from, which can play a significant role in where they live. Changing urban settings and lifestyle choices often play a big role in a young professional\u2019s life when deciding where to live. While many of these professionals inhabit big cities where they may have more opportunities and better access to amenities, many decide to leave these cities for smaller towns. Here are 22 reasons why young professionals are leaving big cities for small towns: Housing Costs 22 Reasons Why Young Professionals Are Leaving Big Cities for Small Towns Housing costs in big cities are continually growing, which impacts many young professionals. These people often spend a large portion of their monthly income to cover housing costs, which leaves them with little left to cover other expenses and contribute to their savings fund. The rise in the\u00a0cost of rentals makes it difficult for many professionals. It lowers the possibility of city homeownership and drives many people to leave big cities for smaller towns. Remote Work Over the years, more and more remote work opportunities have opened up, allowing young professionals to live anywhere they want while earning an income from a company based in a big city. Remote work enables these professionals to move to areas that enable them to spend less and live in an area of their choosing while maintaining a big city job. Affordability Another contributing factor to the change in location from big cities to smaller towns among many young professionals is affordability. Smaller towns often offer more affordable costs for amenities and utilities, including water bills, groceries, etc., which can significantly lower the cost of living. Young professionals who can move to s",

But, recent trends suggest a shift in where people are choosing to settle as people are opting for a stress-free lifestyle outside of the city. We look at 15 reasons why young professionals are leaving big cities in 2024: Housing Costs Housing costs and the overall cost of living are the number one reason young people are living in more suburban areas. Major cities are a significant deterrent for many young professionals with the likes of New York, San Francisco and Boston averaging over $3,500 rent per month. Rising costs of essentials like food, utilities and healthcare are also piling on the pressure for young people living in the city.\u00a0 Quality of Life Concerns Traffic Congestion is also an issue for young people who rely on efficient commutes to work. Commuting times in large cities can be time-consuming and stressful due to heavy traffic and costly fares. With heavy traffic comes pollution, with air and water pollution levels can be higher in urban areas, impacting health and well-being. The constant noise and crowds can also be overwhelming and contribute to stress of city living. Work-Life Balance Living outside of a busy city offers true relaxation time outside of work hours, with more parks and quiet spaces adding balance to busy office life. With remote work more accessible than ever it\u2019s easier for professionals to work from anywhere. Community and Connection Some people find working in a big city isolating, despite large populations. The anonymity and fast-paced nature of big cities can lead to feelings of loneliness which make young people desire a move to a quieter town. Many young professionals are drawn to the sense of community and connection found in smaller towns, which better supports their mental health.\u00a0 Environmental Concerns Concerns about climate change and sustainability are driving many young people to seek a more environmentally frien",

Now, they\u2019re leaving big metro areas in droves and powering growth in small towns and rural areas. Since the pandemic, cities with more than 1 million residents have lost adults ages 25 to 44 while towns with smaller populations have gained young people, after accounting for both those moving in and leaving, according to a University of Virginia analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data. \u201cYounger adults have driven most of the shift towards small towns and rural areas since the pandemic,\u201d said Hamilton Lombard, the study's author and a demographer at the University of Virginia\u2019s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. It\u2019s no surprise that the health crisis fueled a migration of many Americans young and old to less populated areas with lower risk of contagion. But even as fears around COVID-19 have eased significantly, the endurance of the remote work shift sparked by the crisis and lower costs in smaller metro areas have continued to encourage young Americans to move to rural communities, Lombard said. \u201cThe migration of younger adults into small towns and rural areas picked up last year rather than returning to pre-pandemic trends,\u201d he said.

Design/methodology/approach A sample of university business students (n=305) took part in the study. The data were collected using a tailored questionnaire designed to assess respondents' level of N\u2010ach motivation and their relative potential to pursue entrepreneurial activities. Findings The results revealed a strong correlation between N\u2010ach and entrepreneurial potential among the participants. Analysis of differences across gender and nationality was also conducted, revealing lower levels of N\u2010ach for UAE national participants, and higher levels of N\u2010ach among women participants. Practical implications Results support the view that achievement motivation is a potentially important factor in explaining entrepreneurial success. It also highlights a potential problem for the UAE economy and society in addressing the relatively low levels of N\u2010ach among UAE nationals, especially males. Originality/value Despite a professed desire on the part of the UAE Government to diversify the economy and promote entrepreneurial activity among UAE nationals, little research has been done on the nature of important variables such as N\u2010ach and entrepreneurial potential in the region. This research addresses a key gap in the literature by exploring this relationship. Keywords Citation Ryan, J.C., Tipu, S.A. and Zeffane, R.M.

We identified the underlying mechanism and moderator of the relationship between socioeconomic factors and international entrepreneurship intentions. Introduction With the accelerating globalization of the world economy, scholarly attention to international entrepreneurship (IE) has increased rapidly over the past decade (Ahsan and Fernhaber, 2019). Specifically, scholars [e.g., Yao et al. (2020)] have developed a strong interest in the emerging IE mindset among young adult generation. They believe that the transition from school-to-work is an important period for understanding successful IE (Middermann, 2020). This also concerns the major societal goal of educating the next wave of IE in order to improve the international entrepreneurial capabilities to meet the global challenges of the twenty-first century (Zucchella, 2021). Many previous studies have attempted to identify factors that affect entrepreneurial intentions, such as education (Li\u00f1\u00e1n et al., 2011), contextual factors (Turker and Sonmez Sel\u00e7uk, 2009), and personality traits (de Janasz et al., ",

Rural Startups: Challenges and Opportunities Outside the Metro In the bustling, high-rise laden landscapes of metropolitan cities, the entrepreneurial spirit thrives with a magnetic fervor, attracting dreamers from every nook and cranny. Yet, beyond the city limits, in the gentle embrace of sprawling meadows and serene townscapes, another kind of entrepreneurial journey beckons. Rural startups, often overshadowed by their urban counterparts, offer a fresh perspective on business. While they come with their unique set of challenges, they also open doors to opportunities that can\u2019t be found amidst the city chaos. Contents The Appeal of Rural Startups Amidst the clamor for tech-driven startups in metropolitan hubs, the allure of rural ventures might seem like a divergent path. However, the entrepreneurial journey in the countryside is both distinct and rewarding in ways one might not initially recognize. While the city offers a vast network, pace, and modernity, rural areas present their own unique advantages that can be leveraged for a successful venture. Lower Operational Costs The phrase \u2018location, location, location\u2019 isn\u2019t just a real estate mantra. When it comes to establishing a business, location plays a pivotal role in determining many of the foundational costs. In comparison to cities, where prices for office spaces can skyrocket, rural areas provide a reprieve with significantly lower costs. Whether you\u2019re setting up a storefront, an office, or a manufacturing unit, the vast stretches of land available in rural regions come at a fraction of the cost. This not only means reduced overheads but also the luxury of more space to expand, innovate, and create. While compensation does vary depending on the industry and the specific roles, rural regions tend to have a lower average wage rate than urban centers. This can lead to a more cost-effective staffing strategy, provided entrepreneurs invest in training and ensuring employee satisfaction in other non-monetary ways.",

Rural entrepreneurship typically emerges in areas with lower population densities, often focusing on agriculture, craft, and local resources. These ventures face challenges like limited access to markets and technology, but benefit from a close-knit community structure and in-depth local knowledge. Conversely, urban entrepreneurship thrives in densely populated cities, leveraging advanced infrastructure, diverse markets, and greater access to technology and capital. However, urban entrepreneurs often encounter intense competition and higher operational costs. Table of Contents Who are Rural Entrepreneurs and Who are Urban Entrepreneurs? Rural entrepreneurs are individuals who initiate and run businesses in rural areas. They often capitalize on local resources, traditions, and community relationships. Their ventures typically involve agriculture, artisanal crafts, and services catering to local needs. These entrepreneurs are characterized by their deep understanding of the rural ecosystem, community-driven approach, and often, a focus on sustainability and social impact. Urban entrepreneurs, on the other hand, operate in city environments where they have access to a broader market, advanced technology, and diverse human resources. Their businesses range widely, from tech startups to retail and services, often driven by innovation and scalability. These entrepreneurs navigate a fast-paced, competitive landscape, leveraging urban infrastructure and networking opportunities to grow their ventures.

Local leaders are getting more proactive about nurturing entrepreneurial ecosystems by providing support systems, resources and an environment conducive for aspiring business owners to thrive. The Rural Potential Research shows rural counties tend to have higher rates of self-employed business proprietors compared to metro areas. However, rural entrepreneurship had been waning for years prior to the pandemic, with more firms closing than opening annually in rural regions between 2008-2018. That negative trend now appears to be reversing. Organizations like Higher Purpose Co. in Mississippi are empowering Black entrepreneurs through coordinated funding assistance, business training, marketing help and more.

Small Towns: An Unexpected Home for Young Entrepreneurs For those of us in Rural America, we're used to hearing (and often believing, unfortunately) the narrative that our best and brightest are moving away. The media calls it the \"Brain Drain\" suggesting that we educate our kids, only to encourage them to leave, stealing any chance for us to realize a return on the investment of that education. Recently, we sat down with one of our bright, talented young people who returned to our community. At the fresh age of just 24, Addison Magill is running a successful business and she was gracious enough to share with us just how our community and her experiences as a kid shaped her into who she is today. When we sat down, Addison was one week away from presenting at a conference called Tomorrow's Top Hands with the North Dakota Stockmen's Association. When asked more about the nature of the conference, Addison said, \"Basically, it's trying to build leaders in the beef industry. They get to tour some different places within the industry, hear from speakers, and learn about the career paths they can follow within the beef industry.\" Specifically, she'd been asked to be on a panel for entrepreneurship within the beef industry. Addison is the founder and lead creator of Addison K. Creative Co., a creative company founded on production ag values, designed to build livestock and agribusiness brands. When she was a freshman in high school, Addison attended this conference. \"I had been involved in some other leadership programs for Future Farmers of America (FFA), and it just felt like a good fit. I knew I wanted to be in the beef industry and I thought it was a great opportunity to connect with other people with similar interests and build my leadership skills.\" It's wild for Addison to look back on her journey from being a student in the audience to a presenter on the stage. \"I really got started with the communication side of the ag business when my family had a cattle sale and I st",

Every generation has had its share of successful young entrepreneurs, from agriculturalist Eliza Lucas Pinckney (1800s) to Apple founder Steve Jobs (1900s). Now, it's Generation Z's turn. Born between 1997 and 2012, this generation is finding innovative ways to make their own income. For many of these bright stars, that means starting early to pursue\u00a0entrepreneurship as a means to leave their mark on the world.

Hart Main At age 13, Hart Main came up with the idea of manly scented candles after teasing his sister about the girly scented ones she was selling for a school fundraiser. It wasn't until Hart set out to purchase a $1,500 bike that he reconsidered what he suggested in jest. Hart and his parents contributed nominal amounts to begin the business and worked together to develop the candles, cleverly named ManCans. They are now handmade by the Beaver Creek Candle Company in Lisbon, Ohio, by a workforce consisting of people diagnosed with developmental challenges. Adopting a simple and masculine theme, ManCans candles\u2014with available scents including Campfire, Bacon, Sawdust, Fresh Cut Grass, and Grandpa's Pipe\u2014are made using soup cans. As of 2016, Hart's candles are sold in every state, with sales exceeding six figures annually. Giving back to the community, Hart donates part of each sale to soup kitchens in Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Michigan. Kamaria War",

New business formation is an important driver of employment and the creation of new jobs in the United States. In this study, AdvisorSmith researched the number of new businesses formed on a per capita basis in 353 U.S. cities and 50 U.S. states to find the cities and states where people are most likely to start a new business. We also broke down the cities by size in order to fairly compare business creation rates in similar-sized cities. Our study focused on businesses that employ at least one paid employee, which excludes entities like financial or real estate holding companies. The United States has approximately 6 million businesses that have at least one employee, and the average rate of business creation was 2.3 new businesses created per 1,000 population. There were approximately 750,000 new businesses created in the United States in 2018. The top 7 states for business creation were western states, with Montana leading the way. Mississippi was the state where people were least likely to start a new business.

While many small rural towns face economic distress, some manage to overcome the odds to succeed in attracting new firms and job opportunities. It\u2019s well-known that small rural towns often face economic distress. Along with losses of established businesses, rates of self-employment have fallen in rural towns of all sizes.\u00a0Towns with a population of 10,000 or less had the largest decline and an even greater decline in employment rates. Attracting new business startups in small towns is difficult, but some small towns succeed in attracting new firms. What characteristics do these towns have that cause firms to locate there? A new study led by economists at Iowa State University examines data consistently collected over two decades on a sample of 98 typical small Iowa towns that don\u2019t share a border with a metropolitan city. The study looks at which factors encourage or discourage new firm entry in these\u00a0towns and suggests policy implications for addressing economic distress in small rural towns. Peter Orazem, University Professor of Economics at Iowa State, said, \u201cSince 2000, the only areas that consistently added new firms and increased employment were metropolitan areas. In contrast, the communities losing the most employees and entrepreneurs were towns under 10,000 population. But some of these small towns bucked the trend and were able to continue to attract new firm entry and employment.\u201d The research\u00a0is reported in a recent article in the American Journal of Agricultural Economics, \"Which small towns attract start-ups and why? Twenty years of evidence from Iowa.\"\u00a0Orazem\u2019s co-authors were the late Georgeanne Artz, associate professor of economics at Iowa State; Peter Han, social science analyst with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development; and Younjun Kim, associate professor of economics at Southern Connecticut State University.

Nitesh Garg Because of the focus on big cities for running businesses, many are becoming very expensive, crowded, and hard to thrive in as a new business. Because of this, many entrepreneurs, startups, and businesses are taking their ideas and their companies to smaller towns and cities around the country. Before you decide to do this with yourself and your business, keep reading. We're going over 3 things you need to consider when choosing between a small town vs big city options for your company. 1. Office Space: One of the main things that are driving people out of larger cities is the issue of space. New York is perhaps the most classic example of overcrowding. But most major cities like Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago and more are all becoming very crowded for businesses. This decreases the amount of permanent and private office space that\u2019s available to companies. One solution besides moving from a big city is to opt for a coworking space that can be rented out as needed. This decreases expenses and the need to have large amounts of employees in the crowded cities. Other businesses find it easier to move to city suburbs or locations that are somewhat close to metropolitan areas in small towns. However, a big drawback with that solution is that the business address is no longer as impressive or prestigious. That\u2019s where virtual office spac",

As many veteran entrepreneurs and failed startups understand well, bigger is not always better. A city with a smaller population can offer a greater chance of success, depending on an entrepreneur\u2019s personal preferences and the type of business they\u2019re starting. The best cities can even help new businesses survive economic shocks such as pandemics or inflation. To determine the best small cities to start a business, WalletHub compared the business-friendliness of more than 1,300 small-sized cities. Our data set of 18 key metrics ranges from the growth rate of the number of small businesses to investor access and labor costs. Cassandra Happe, WalletHub Analyst Main Findings Best Small Cities for Starting a Business \u00a0 In-Depth Look at the Best Small Cities to Start a Business Cedar City, UT Cedar City, UT, is the best small city to start a business. It has one of the highest rates of startups per capita, as well as the fourth-highest growth in the number of small businesses between 2015 and 2021, at over 33%. This growth is significant because it shows that the city has the conditions to keep small businesses afloat even during this period of economic difficulty. Cedar City has the fourth-lowest average commute time, too, at just 13 minutes, so people can spend less time sitting in traffic and more time being productive. It ranks in the top 100 cities (out of more than 1,300) when it comes to annual employment growth and working-age population growth. There will be plenty of people for new businesses to hire in the future. St. George, UT St. George, UT, is the second-best small city for starting a business, ranking at the top of the country for both startups per capita and growth in the number of small businesses (over 42% between 2015 and 2021). St. George also has very cheap office space, costing around $10.73 per square foot. In contrast, the mos",

Cassandra Happe, WalletHub Analyst Main Findings Best Small Cities for Starting a Business In-Depth Look at the Best Small Cities to Start a Business Cedar City, UT Cedar City, UT, is the best small city to start a business. It has one of the highest rates of startups per capita, as well as the fourth-highest growth in the number of small businesses between 2015 and 2021, at over 33%. This growth is significant because it shows that the city has the conditions to keep small businesses afloat even during this period of economic difficulty. Cedar City has the fourth-lowest average commute time, too, at just 13 minutes, so people can spend less time sitting in traffic and more time being productive. It ranks in the top 100 cities (out of more than 1,300) when it comes to annual employment growth and working-age population growth. There will be plenty of people for new businesses to hire in the future.

He was very insistent on moving back to the country after living in the city for a handful of years. I was on board because I wanted to see him happy, but honestly I had no idea how much country living would change my life! We\u2019ve now lived in the country outside a small town of 1000 people for almost seven years. I think our children have benefited the most from this lifestyle change. I would not trade our children\u2019s upbringing for anything in this world. I am 100% a convert from city living. Raising kids in the countryside can offer numerous benefits, contributing to a unique and enriching upbringing. Here are several reasons why some parents choose to raise their children in a rural or country environment. 1. Connection with Nature 2. Outdoor Activities 3. Less Noise and Pollution 4. Community Values 5. General Safety 6. Life Skills 7. Educational Opportunities 8. Character Development 9. Less Materialism 10. Family Bonding 11. Sense of Independence 12. Healthier Lifestyle 13. Cultural and Community Events 14. Stress Reduction \u00a0 This article isn\u2019t meant to pass judgement on anyone who is not living in the country. Every family is unique, and what works for one may not work for another. If you have a yearning to raise your children in this environment, I strongly encourage you to explore that option.

Now, let\u2019s dive deeper into these four advantages. \u00a0 Safe for Kids \u00a0 As a parent, it\u2019s your responsibility to ensure that your kids are safe. Thankfully, small towns tend to be safer than big cities due to low crime rates. They are safe to the extent that some homeowners don\u2019t lock their doors when leaving their houses. In some small towns, car owners can leave their car doors unlocked without worrying about car thefts. Be sure that your kids will be safe in such an environment. To find the safest neighbourhoods in your favourite small town, visit ballymorehomes.com. \u00a0 Low Traffic \u00a0 Heavy traffic is a common problem in big cities like Toronto. When commuting from one point to another, you must add extra time for travel due to delays. Besides, living in big cities with busy roads and heavy traffic can be dangerous for your kids. When you live in a small town, you won\u2019t experience delays since there\u2019s no heavy traffic. You can move from one part of the town to another point within a few minutes. Besides, the low traffic makes small towns safer for kids compared to big cities. \u00a0 Strong Sense of Community \u00a0 It wouldn\u2019t be wrong to say that most people who live in big cities mind about their businesses.

Despite the trials and tribulations, my small-town upbringing has taught me many valuable lessons. I often say, \u201cWhat you put into the community is what you get out of it.\u201d I have always believed that this community has helped me become who I am today. I am mountain made. (Pun totally intended.) Today, I want to share some of those lessons with you. What you can and can\u2019t get away with One of the first things I learned as a child is what I could and couldn\u2019t get away with. Not only are small towns notorious for town gossip, someone is always watching. Time and time again, I watched my peers try to get away with some rebellious act without getting caught. For example, one time a group of high schoolers ditched school to eat lunch at a local restaurant. The school clerk caught them when she walked in to pick up her lunch. Their failures taught me that doing something stupid wasn\u2019t worth the consequences. Have pride in yourself. I don\u2019t say something unless I am willing and able to back it up. You will receive pushback so you have to be ready to stand by your words or actions. If you don\u2019t want the whole town talking about you, don\u2019t give them something to talk about. Most importantly, when you do something wrong, there's no hiding it. Make your wrongs right by taking responsibility for your actions. How to get along with people you disagree with While I haven't completely masted this skill it is too important to leave off. Whether it\u2019s kids at school or your bossy neighbor, in a small town, you have to learn to live with people you don\u2019t necessarily like. Avoidance is not an option. It\u2019s Murphy's law.

We might wonder if we\u2019re ready for raising a family in such a challenging environment and that might be the reason number one for delaying parenting so much.\u00a0 Yes, this environment can undermine the values learned in small communities. On the other hand, the fast-paced environment may allow children to develop independence and a sense of self-reliance. Growing Up In A Big City Growing up in a big city can have its advantages and disadvantages.\u00a0 For one, it can make it easier to get access to health care. The number of physicians practicing in big cities is higher, and these doctors are easier to reach.\u00a0 Children living in rural areas often don\u2019t get the same amount of access to doctors and health advice. Living in a city also offers kids more exposure to diverse cultures and lifestyles. They can explore their artistic abilities, as well as learn to live with people of different beliefs. In addition, city children can play on a variety of playground equipment in parks and urban green spaces.\u00a0 There are also bike rental kiosks, riverfront spaces, and paved walking paths. Big city kids also learn to be independent. These skills will help them later in life. They also learn to be more social and analytical.\u00a0 Among other things, they learn to respect others and take turns in conversations. They also learn to be considerate of other people and traffic flow. In addition to this, living in a city can make kids more tolerant of different languages. Children living in big cities have the opportunity to learn more about a variety of cultures and backgrounds. For example, they can attend musical concerts and cultural events on weekends. In contrast, children living in the countryside have fewer cultural experiences. Children in the countryside rarely visit museums, or interact with different types ",

Raising a Family in the City Photo via @nataliesjourney Advantages One major advantage of raising children in the city is easy access to after-school or weekend activities. Movie theaters, museums, galleries, and festivals are all fun ways for kids and parents to enjoy themselves outside the home. Plus, most entertainment districts are within walking distance. If your family lives in the city, you can increase your exercise and decrease your time in a vehicle. Along with more amenities, cities have public transit options like trains, buses, or subways that can make getting your kids to activities or home without a car easy. Owning a vehicle costs roughly\u00a0$8,558\u00a0a year, making it a major expense that can strain family budgets. But living in a city means your family can walk and utilize public transportation more often, saving on vehicle maintenance costs and gas. You may even be able to get rid of your vehicle altogether! Speaking of transportation, if you work and live in the city, you can cut your drive time to work drastically. With\u00a025 minute one-way average commute times\u00a0(not including rush hour delays), those who work in the city but live in the suburbs spend at least an hour a day in commute traffic. In the city, your kids will be able to meet people from all walks of life. Schools are often more diverse, and after-school activities will offer opportunities to expand social horizons. Even walking the streets will provide tons of visual stimuli and the chance ",

However, some of the biggest social issues for children include fostering autonomy, building community, and combating obesity. And as a parent raising two young kids in a big-city neighborhood, I\u2019ve learned that urban living can have positive effects in all three areas. Autonomy Many\u00a0recent\u00a0articles\u00a0have discussed how modern intensive parenting is smothering kids\u2019 autonomy and harming their ability to build self-reliance. There is no panacea for this, but the rhythms of big-city living can have significant positive effects. Consider transportation. My own suburban childhood included hours each day strapped to a car seat, being ferried to school, friends\u2019 houses, or extracurricular activities. For a kid, it\u2019s hard to imagine a more passive or parent-dependent mode of transportation. By contrast, this way of life is utterly foreign to my own urban kids. We walk to school, friends\u2019 houses, and extracurricular activities at the local community center. For trips farther afield in the city, we take the Metro. While my kids are still too young to ride the Metro unattended, there\u2019s something ineffably charming about a four-year old swiping his own Metro card at the turnstile and navigating the stations on roughly-equal footing as an adult. More importantly, I\u2019d argue that navigating public transit like an adult helps build kids\u2019 self-reliance and sense of agency, compared to passively sitting in the back seat of a car day after day. (Added bonus: whenever we do take a Zipcar to state parks and the like, the car ride itself feels like a special adventure instead of a mundane event). Community Walkable urban neighborhoods can also foster a sense of community, as other commentators\u00a0have noted. M",

The availability of safe and affordable housing, income supports, food assistance, job training, childcare support, and other services help low-income rural residents take care of themselves so they can stay healthy. When faced with health challenges, people whose basic needs are met are better able to concentrate on recovery and take steps to avoid future problems. Some rural hospitals even employ their own social services staff, in an effort to provide patients with needed services that may help them avoid readmission. By implementing population health strategies and addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH) through the provision of human services, communities may be able to reduce healthcare costs and develop a more efficient healthcare system. Focusing on preventive care and ensuring that patients who use the healthcare system frequently, such as those with chronic conditions, have their basic needs met may lessen the stressors that contribute to their chronic conditions, decrease the amount of healthcare resources they require, and reduce hospital readmissions. See Social Determinants of Health for Rural People for more information on how SDOH can impact health. Rural healthcare providers and facilities can help patients find services to meet their basic needs by recommending benefit programs, providing referrals, or coordinating services with human services providers. Likewise, rural human services providers may find that working with healthcare providers is an effective way to identify unaddressed needs. Connecting human services to healthcare can help make limited resources go further and leverage the close-knit nature of rural communities.

They, along with other rural working families, rely on various social services to help them move toward self-sufficiency. Affording rural residents access to social services is a challenge even in the best of times. With the decline in state revenues expected to continue, the challenge will be greater.\u00a0 Many of the challenges to social service delivery in rural areas are similar to those faced in central cities and metropolitan areas. Other social service delivery challenges are more formidable in rural locations. For example, ensuring access to affordable and adequate child care and convenient and reliable transportation is especially difficult in geographically isolated areas. Encouraging economic development in these areas is also a challenge (Pindus 2001). Rural communities often lack the infrastructure needed to attract businesses, and the expenses associated with development can be high; both factors limit job opportunities. Less commercial development and lower per capita incomes limit local tax revenue in rural areas which may mean fewer resources for social services. Rural employers are less likely than urban and suburban employers to provide health insurance, and access to affordable health care is limited in rural locations. Rural welfare recipients who are making the transition from cash assistance to work rarely continue to make use of Medicaid benefits. Furthermore, rural agency staff sometimes find it hard to identify families in need because the sociological and psychological deterrents to reliance on public assistance are more prevalent in rural communities (Weber, Duncan and Whitener, 2002).\u00a0 The costs per capita associated with service delivery tend to be higher in rural areas because of their ",

Political pundits, media outlets, and other observers frequently underscore the growing polarization across rural and urban communities during this time.1-3 Extant research frequently portrays urban areas as harbingers of demographic and social change.4 Urban areas are often depicted as locales with growing numbers of racial minority and foreign-born residents.4 They are also portrayed as engines of economic growth.6 Politically, they are increasingly perceived to be the homes of social progressives.5 By contrast, rural areas are depicted as the stewards of the traditional way of life that have witnessed the out-migration of young adults in search of better educational and economic opportunities and population aging.4,6 Politically, they are increasingly perceived as the homes of social conservatives.5 The narratives of the rural-urban polarization magnify the perception of two societies with little in common co-existing in a nation. Despite the growing emphasis on the rural-urban divide, some dimensions of rural and urban life are converging. A growing body of work is showing that family life in rural areas is increasingly becoming more similar to family life in urban areas.4,7,8 According to a Pew Report (2018), marriage rates in rural and urban areas have been converging over the past few decades.

Juggling the demands of ministry, family, and community involvement is a complex endeavor that requires careful consideration and intentional effort. Each role comes with its own set of challenges and rewards, making it essential to find ways to harmonize these aspects without compromising any. The importance of this balance cannot be overstated, as it impacts personal well-being, relational dynamics, and overall effectiveness in each area. Understanding how to navigate these responsibilities can lead to a more fulfilling and sustainable lifestyle. Core Principles of Balancing Roles Balancing the multifaceted roles of ministry, family, and community involvement begins with a clear understanding of one\u2019s priorities. Establishing what matters most in each area can provide a roadmap for decision-making and time allocation. This clarity helps in setting boundaries, ensuring that each role receives the attention it deserves without overwhelming the individual. Communication stands as a foundational element in maintaining this balance. Open and honest dialogue with family members, ministry colleagues, and community partners fosters mutual understanding and support. When everyone is aware of each other\u2019s commitments and constraints, it becomes easier to coordinate efforts and share responsibilities. This collaborative approach not only alleviates stress but also strengthens relationships across all areas. Flexibility is another principle that cannot be overlooked. Life is inherently unpredictable, and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances is invaluable. Whether it\u2019s adjusting a family schedule to accommodate a ministry event or finding creative ways to engage with the community, being flexible allows for a more fluid integration of roles.

Mental health is a vital component of family well-being. Issues such as depression, anxiety, addiction, or trauma can profoundly affect family dynamics and individual relationships. Clinical social workers play a crucial role in assisting families dealing with these challenges. They provide support and guidance to help families navigate the complexities of mental health issues, offering counseling, therapy, and resources to manage and overcome these difficulties. Most importantly, they offer comprehensive support, from assessing individual and family needs to developing and implementing treatment plans. The impact of mental health challenges on family relationships cannot be overstated. When one family member is struggling with mental health issues, it can create stress and strain for everyone involved. Effective management and support are essential to maintaining family harmony and preventing long-term issues. Seeking professional help, such as the services provided by clinical social workers, can help families address these problems constructively. Looking up the keyword clinical social worker job duties on your search engine will enable you to understand their distinct yet impactful roles in boosting community and family wellness.\u00a0 Financial stability is another critical factor that affects family well-being.

It entails actively participating in activities or initiatives that benefit one\u2019s local community or broader society. In this guide, \u00a0Mark Belter will explore the multifaceted importance of community involvement and why it matters for individuals and the communities they serve. 1. Building Stronger Communities Community involvement strengthens the bonds within a community. It fosters a sense of belonging and encourages individuals to take ownership of their shared environment. When people engage in activities that improve their community, it becomes more vibrant and cohesive. 2. Addressing Local Issues Through community involvement, individuals can address pressing local issues. Whether it\u2019s volunteering at a food bank, participating in neighborhood cleanups, or mentoring youth, community members play a crucial role in solving problems that impact their daily lives. 3. Personal Growth and Development Community involvement provides opportunities for personal growth and development.

Fostering Empathy and Compassion Engaging with different segments of the community exposes individuals to diverse perspectives and challenges. This exposure fosters empathy and compassion as people become more aware of the struggles and needs of others. 5. Strengthening Social Networks Community involvement allows individuals to connect with like-minded people who share their values and interests.

It takes a village to raise a child \u2014 and support for that village to help the child succeed in school. In our report on The Current State of School Climate in Public School, only 50% of respondents agreed that their district modeled community engagement. With public school enrollment on a major decline, many districts are turning to K-12 family and community partnerships to promote more inclusive engagement. When families and community members are involved in student learning, students improve their academic performance and gain a stronger support system, helping them feel more confident at school. K-12 family and community engagement has long been a focus for schools. However, parental involvement in education tends to decline as students get older. Some studies found as much as a 17% decrease in parental involvement between third through fifth grade and middle school. This trend paired with ongoing academic recovery challenges illustrates the need to involve and support more district community members in the K\u201312 learning environment. By connecting family and community members to school experiences, districts can advance student development and learning, as well as improve school practices and operations by identifying the features that best support students.

Abstract Flexibility is crucial when employees manage their work and family demands and their commute between home and work. The\u00a0current study examined the\u00a0direct and moderation effects of variables from multiple domains including work schedule control (work domain), childcare hours (family domain), and life satisfaction (overall life domain). The impact of the geographic context on work\u2013family conflict was tested with two contextual variables that were generated with Geographic Information System (GIS) technology, where \u2018absolute\u2019 and \u2018relative commute time\u2019 were investigated in relation to work\u2013family conflict.

Sinclair, Committee Chair Dr. Patrick Rosopa Dr. Thomas Britt 2 ABSTRACT People spend a majority of their lives working and commuting is an essential part of most workers\u2019 daily schedule. According to the 2017 American Community Survey distributed by the U.S. Census Bureau, the average commute for Americans is approximately 27 minutes. Time spent commuting has increased in recent decades (Denstadli et al., 2017; Gimenez-Nadal & Molina, 2019; Hoehner et al., 2012; K\u00fcnn\u2010Nelen, 2016). Commuting to work is often a source of stress for workers, and its detrimental impacts are a rising public health issue as well as an area of concern for occupational health psychologists. Commuting is not considered a part of the workday and subsequently has not received as much attention as other wor",

Branding Bar OPRE - Main Navigation Conceptualizing and Measuring Access to Early Care and Education Download Report Introduction Research Questions Recent federal, state, and local policies and initiatives focus on increasing access to high-quality ECE for all families. Given the prevalence and potential importance of these initiatives for families and children, it is useful for the field to take stock of how access to ECE is conceptualized and measured and to understand the extent to which context, purposes, and available indicators shape the assessment of access. A recent report - Defining and Measuring Access to High-Quality Early Care and Education (ECE): A Guidebook for Policymakers and Researchers\u00a0(PDF) \u2014 provided guidance to support movement toward more consistent definitions, analysis and reporting on access. The report offered a family centered definition of access that emphasizes the importance of considering multiple dimensions of access including the degree to which families exert reasonable effort in securing ECE, the affordability of ECE, whether ECE meets the parents\u2019 needs, and whether ECE supports the child\u2019s development. The current report provides findings from a literature review that investigates and catalogues recent efforts to define and operationalize access, with a focus on the extent to which current work at the state and federal level aligns with the multi-dimensional definition of access proposed in the Access Guidebook. The review documents the extent to which current research and policy efforts have expanded beyond measures of the\u00a0 availability of ECE slots and affordability to also include measures of the availabil",

Branding Bar OPRE - Main Navigation Defining and Measuring Access to Child Care and Early Education with Families in Mind Download Brief Introduction Access is often measured in terms of supply (i.e., capacity) of licensed child care and early education (CCEE) centers and family child care (FCC) homes. Sometimes it is measured by counting the number of families who use different types of CCEE. These metrics assume that a large supply of or high use of CCEE means it is accessible to families. Recent research shows that these types of calculations overestimate families\u2019 access to CCEE because they do not account for what families search for, prefer, and need. The Access Guidebook introduced a definition of access that is centered on families and acknowledges four dimensions that families consider when choosing CCEE: access means that parents, with reasonable effort and affordability, can enroll their child in an arrangement that supports the child\u2019s development and meets the parents\u2019 needs. This multi-dimensional definition can help policymakers develop and refine policies that promote greater equitable access to child care for the families they serve. Purpose When families search for CCEE, they weigh several factors at the same time. CCEE access has four dimensions: 1) reasonable effort to find care, 2) affordability of care, 3) care that supports the child\u2019s development, and 4) care that meets parents\u2019 needs. If policymakers consider access in terms of these multiple dimensions, they may be more likely to build the supply of CCEE and provide resources to families that meet their varying needs and preferences.

The truth is, there are positive and negative aspects to both kinds of living. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in 2016, the median household income in rural communities was 4% lower than that of urban communities. However, roughly 3% more families in urban areas were living under the poverty line. The cost of living, earnings potential, and lifestyle differences all combine to make each lifestyle different. Before you decide to buy a farm in the country or get an apartment in Manhattan, it\u2019s essential to understand the pros and cons of both lifestyles. Advantages of urban living While urban living does get a certain amount of negative attention for its high price tag, it also comes with opportunities and amenities that rural living cannot offer. Urban living offers more options for employment, entertainment, and transportation, and many people feel these positives far outweigh the disadvantages. Earnings potential According to Bloomberg, urban areas (both large and small) consistently report earnings higher than the national average. Residents can find higher-paying jobs in urban areas than in rural areas, which leads to higher net worth. There is also a wider range of job opportunities for workers. Urban areas have long lists of businesses. A rural area will have a more limited list of open job opportunities, and thus a limited amount of earning potential for residents. Entertainment Urban areas have a variety of entertainment options. From restaurants and bars to music venues and community events, urban areas have fun activities for everyone. If you\u2019re on a budget, urban areas also offer free or low-cost entertainment opportunities. These include: Taking advantage of low-cost entertainment can help residents stick to their budgets, and avoid credit card debt while living in a high-cost area. It",

Here are the differences between rural and urban living in terms of budget, housing, net worth and lifestyle. Whether you\u2019re thinking about moving to the city or away from a city, it is good to know what kind of budget items you\u2019ll be looking at and how they differ. Living in a rural area isn\u2019t always as cheap as people assume. Let\u2019s start with some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics analysis of urban vs rural living costs. These statistics come from US Census data, which considers areas inside of metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) \u201curban\u201d and those outside MSAs \u201crural.\u201d It\u2019s not a perfect measure, but it\u2019s usually not clear exactly where the city ends and the country begins, so you have to draw the line somewhere. On average, households in urban areas earn $15,779 more than households in rural areas but they also spent $7,808 more than rural households. That leaves urban households have an extra $7,971 to save or invest. According to our Income Spending Simulator, over a period of 30 years, if that money were saved at rate of 5% it would add up to an additional $667,000 in net worth! However, the deeper you dive into the differences between urban and rural households, the blurrier the lines become in terms of which place is better for your budget and net worth.

Consequently, the types and levels of assets that rural Americans have could result in them missing out on owning certain financial instruments that may help them better build wealth. This Issue Brief examines the financial situations of Americans who live in urban areas vs. those who do not live in these areas (rural) by using the Survey of Income and Program Participation from the U.S. Census Bureau. The net result is that rural individuals appear to be missing out on certain financial assets, which over the long term have provided much higher rates of return than many other investments. Other means to access the financial markets may be necessary. In addition, rural business owners appear to have their assets highly concentrated in their businesses, which could be out of necessity to run their businesses. However, a better diversification of assets could help protect these individuals\u2019 retirement prospects if something caused the business to close. One clear commonality is that banks seem to be the economic base of most individuals, including those living in rural areas. Better understanding of how banks are being used by rural individuals may allow for an increase in the ownership of other assets for these individuals. 901 D Street, SW, Suite 802, Washington, DC 20024Phone: (202) 659-0670 | Fax: (202) 775-6360 | info@ebri.org Copyright \u00a9 1996 - 2017\u00a0Employee Benefit Research Institute.

Authors Affiliations Abstract This paper describes a scoping review of 42 studies of neighborhood effects on developmental health for children ages 0-6, published between 2009 and 2014. It focuses on three themes: (1) theoretical mechanisms that drive early childhood development, i.e. how neighborhoods matter for early childhood development; (2) dependence of such mechanisms on place-based characteristics i.e. where neighborhood effects occur; (3) dependence of such mechanisms on child characteristics, i.e. for whom is development most affected. Given that ecological systems theories postulate diverse mechanisms via which neighborhood characteristics affect early child development, we specifically examine evidence on mediation and/or moderation effects. We conclude by discussing future challenges, and proposing recommendations for analyses that utilize ecological longitudinal population-based databases.

Abstract A growing body of research in the United States and Western Europe documents significant effects of the physical environment (toxins, pollutants, noise, crowding, chaos, housing, school and neighborhood quality) on children and adolescents\u2019 cognitive and socioemotional development. Much less is known about these relations in other contexts, particularly the global South. We thus briefly review the evidence for relations between child development and the physical environment in Western contexts, and discuss some of the known mechanisms behind these relations. We then provide a more extensive review of the research to date outside of Western contexts, with a specific emphasis on research in the global South. Where the research is limited, we highlight relevant data documenting the physical environment conditions experienced by children, and make recommendations for future work. In these recommendations, we highlight the limitations of employing r",

Abstract Villages provide members with a wide range of support including socialization, vetted vendors and other services that assist the elder to age in place. While not every Village offers the same types of support many older adults join Villages to gain benefits they may have lost (such as an informal support network) or ones they cannot find (such as identifying reliable providers of home repair). However, Villages are not available everywhere and there are barriers to Village membership, especially cost. Do older adults without access to a Village simply \u201cdo without\u201d or do some of them create the same type of support system on their own? This presentation, using data collected in focus groups and individual interviews for a study of aging in community will describe the ways in which older adults have fashioned their own set of services and socialization opportunities to achieve the same goals as Village membership.

Understanding these differences is important for individuals considering where to live, work or travel. Rural areas are typically characterized by low population density, expansive natural landscapes, and a strong sense of community, often with agriculture playing a key role in the local economy. In contrast, urban areas are defined by their high population density, diverse and dense built environments, and a wide array of economic activities, including manufacturing, services, and technology sectors. This article aims to look into the nuanced distinctions between these two settings. By exploring population density, lifestyle, economic activities, infrastructure, environmental quality, and living costs, we can better appreciate the unique challenges and opportunities each presents. The goal is to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview, enabling readers to draw informed conclusions about the implications of living and working in rural versus urban areas. Population Density and Size: Contrasting Rural and Urban Realities The distinction between rural and urban areas is most starkly evident in their population density and community size. Population density refers to the number of people living per unit of area, typically measured in inhabitants per square kilometre or square mile, and it significantly influences the social dynamics, infrastructure, and resources of an area. Urban Areas: High-Density and Larger Communities Urban areas are characterized by their high population density. These regions are hubs of economic, cultural, and social activities, attracting a diverse population. According to the United Nations, in 2018, approxi",

How urban, suburban and rural residents interact with their neighbors Table of Contents Table of Contents Most Americans say they know at least some of their neighbors, but only about three-in-ten say they know all or most of them. Rural residents are more likely than those in urban or suburban areas to say they know all or most of their neighbors, but they don\u2019t necessarily interact with their neighbors more than their counterparts in other community types. Overall, Americans tend to be trusting of their neighbors, but this is particularly the case in suburban and rural areas. About six-in-ten in these types of community say they have a neighbor they would trust with a key to their home, compared with about half in urban areas. When asked to describe their neighbors, people in rural areas are far more likely than those in cities and suburbs to say all or most of their neighbors share their race or ethnicity. Suburbanites are somewhat more likely than their urban and rural counterparts to say their neighbors are the same social class as they are, while relatively few across community types say all or most of their neighbors share their political views. Rural residents are the most likely to know their neighbors Four-in-ten rural residents say they know all or most of their neighbors; the shares are smaller among those living in urban (24%) and suburban (28%) areas. Across community types, Americans ages 65 and older are substantially more likely than their younger counterparts to say they know all or most of their neighbors. The oldest urban residents are 24 percentage points more likely than those ages 18 to 29 to say they know all or most of their neighbors (39% vs. 15%); that gap is 18 points among suburban residents (36% vs. 18%) and 14 points among rural residents (48% vs. 34%).

The country is growing in numbers, it\u2019s becoming more racially and ethnically diverse and the population is aging. But according to a new analysis by Pew Research Center, these trends are playing out differently across community types. Urban areas are at the leading edge of racial and ethnic change, with nonwhites now a clear majority of the population in urban counties while solid majorities in suburban and rural areas are white. Urban and suburban counties are gaining population due to an influx of immigrants in both types of counties, as well as domestic migration into suburban areas. In contrast, rural counties have made only minimal gains since 2000 as the number of people leaving for urban or suburban areas has outpaced the number moving in. And while the population is graying in all three types of communities, this is happening more rapidly in the suburbs than in urban and rural counties. At the same time, urban and rural communities are becoming increasingly different from each other politically. Adults in urban counties, long aligned with the Democratic Party, have moved\u00a0even more to the left in recent years, and today twice as many urban voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic as affiliate with the Republican Party. For their part, rural adults have moved more firmly into the Republican camp. More than half (54%) of rural voters now identify with or lean to the GOP, while 38% are Democrats or lean Democratic. Against this backdrop, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that many urban and rural residents feel misunderstood and looked down on by Americans living in other types of communities.

And among those still employed, the young were nearly twice as likely to be on unpaid leave, according to the May 2020 Labour Force Survey. Nevertheless, young people possess some labour market advantages. A large fraction of their skills can be readily transferred to other jobs. Young workers tend not to have small business debts or family obligations. They are unlikely to own homes that must be sold to take up employment in other locations. Young people also tend to be more physically able to take up seasonal natural resource jobs, which are often lucrative. What\u2019s more, this age group is less likely to have the pre-existing medical conditions that seem to make COVID-19 more deadly. Spent fewer weeks on the job Young workers have generally worked at their jobs for shorter periods than older employees. The Labour Force Survey showed workers under age 30 had been with their current workplace for an average of 31 weeks. Those aged 31 to 65 had worked at the same place for an average of 115 weeks. Prior to the pandemic, young workers also spent less time unemployed when they did lose jobs. In April 2019, the average amount of time an unemployed youth had spent without work was about 11 weeks. Unemployed workers aged 30 or older had spent nearly twice as many weeks searching, on average. Even in a labour market upended by COVID-19, the ways economists think about matching jobs to workers are useful for predicting what might happen to young people",

The pros and cons of moving out of the city Before you move to a smaller town, ask yourself these key questions. by Nicole Dieker In 2017, I did something that my younger self once swore she would never do: I sold half of what I owned, packed up the rest and moved back to the Midwest. I had spent much of my early adulthood bouncing from one major coastal city to another, and this move took me from Seattle, Washington (population 744,955) to Cedar Rapids, Iowa (population 133,174). Like many people, I moved to be closer to family \u2014 but I also moved to take advantage of the lower cost of living, save more money and begin working towards financial independence. Rebecca Lake, personal finance expert and blogger at Boss Single Mama and Haven Life contributor, recently made a similar move \u2014 and took her children with her. \u201cI moved from Charleston, South Carolina, which is a pretty big city, to a town of less than 5,000 people. Financially, I\u2019ve been able to save a lot of money because things are cheaper, but there have been some trade-offs.\u201d In my case, the trade-offs were minimal. The benefits, on the other hand \u2014 a stronger relationship with my parents, the opportunity to participate in community arts organizations, the ability to significantly increase my net worth \u2014\u00a0were overwhelmingly positive. In fact, I\u2019d go so far as to say that my move to Cedar Rapids was the best $5,929.10 I\u2019ve ever spent.It\u2019s not just me. According to the Pew Research Center, 22% of American adults have either moved or know someone who moved because of the coronavirus, many of them being young adults leaving bigger cities. A Brookings Institution report indicates that this trend actually predates the coronavirus, and that we are in the middle of \u201ca longer-term, national dispersal away from large metropolitan area populations.\u201d Does that mean leaving the big city behind is the right move for you?

This generation, born between the mid-1990s and early 2010s, is known for its preference for experiences over material possessions and a desire to lead a more sustainable lifestyle. As a result, many young people are leaving urban areas in search of a slower pace of life and closer connection with nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has also played a role in accelerating this trend as remote work becomes more common and people seek out less crowded environments. While this shift away from cities may have significant impacts on urban economies, it represents an opportunity for rural communities to thrive and attract new residents. Reasons Why Gen Z Is Leaving Cities There are several reasons why Gen Z is leaving cities for the countryside. One of the main factors is the high cost of living in urban areas, particularly in terms of housing. Many young people are struggling to afford rent or mortgages, and find that they can get more for their money by moving to rural areas. Additionally, there is a growing desire among young people for a simpler, more sustainable lifestyle. This often involves growing their own food, living off the land, and being closer to nature. The COVID-19 pandemic has also accelerated this trend as many young people have been able to work remotely and no longer feel tied to city locations for employment opportunities. Ultimately, Gen Z\u2019s move towards rural living reflects a desire for affordability, sustainability and freedom. The Advantages Of Living In The Countryside For Gen Z, the advantages of living in the countryside are manifold. Firstly, it offers a slower pace of life, which can be a welcome change from the hustle and bustle of city living. This can be particularly beneficial for those who struggle with anxiety or stress-related issues. Secondly, there is greater a",

Air pollution, malnutrition, and lack of safe public spaces and sanitation are all major global health and wellbeing challenges to which children and young people are particularly vulnerable.

And, in a couple weeks, amid the costumes and candy, ghosts and goblins of Halloween, the world will mark UN World Cities Day on October 31st. For good reason, youth are part of the conversation.\u00a0 In today\u2019s global landscape, two demographic patterns should stand out:\u00a0 rapid urbanization and large youth populations.\u00a0 These patterns are especially robust across developing nations.\u00a0 Already the worlds\u2019 cities host half of its citizens, and Asia and Africa are expected to account for 90% of urban growth. While growing, cities have also become younger \u2013 many of the world\u2019s nearly four billion people under the age of 30 live in urban areas, and according to UN-HABITAT, it is estimated that 60% of urban populations will be under the age of 18 by 2030.

At the same time, however, this is not always the shape of urban development, and especially not for younger citizens. Inequality and exclusion are widespread, often at rates greater than the national average, at the expense of sustainable development that delivers for all.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract This study examined and compared how unsupportive relationships, perceived stress, and authentic self-presentation influence loneliness and what differences exist between these relationships across urban and rural young adults in Taiwan. In total, 356 young adults (188 urban and 168 rural) were investigated, and partial least squares structural equation modelling was used in this study. The results indicated that authentic self-presentation directly and negatively affects loneliness in the urban group, but only indirectly affects loneliness in the rural group through unsupportive relationships and perceived stress. Unsupportive relationships and perceived stress in both the urban and rural groups positively affect their loneliness. In addition, multiple group analysis revealed that significant differences only existed between the effects of authentic self-presentation on unsupportive relationships between urban and rural young adults.

Atherton, 3695 Cullen Blvd, Room 229D, Houston, TX 77204. oeatherton@uh.edu Issue date 2024 Feb. Abstract One large focus of personality psychology is to understand the biopsychosocial factors responsible for adult personality development and well-being change. However, little is known about how macro-level contextual factors, such as rurality-urbanicity, are related to personality development and well-being change. The present study uses data from two large longitudinal studies of U.S. Americans (MIDUS, HRS) to examine whether there are rural-urban differences in levels and changes in the Big Five personality traits and well-being (i.e., psychological well-being, life satisfaction) in adulthood. Multilevel models showed that Americans who lived in more rural areas tended to have lower levels of openness, conscientiousness, and psychological well-being, and higher levels of neuroticism. With the exception of psychological well-being (which replicated across MIDUS and HRS), rural-urban differences in personality traits were only evident in the HRS sample. The effect of neuroticism was fully robust to the inclusion of socio-demographic and social network covariates, but other effects were partially robust (i.e., conscientiousness, openness) or were not robust at all (i.e., psychological well-being). In both samples, there were no rural-urban differences in Big Five or well-be",

The country is growing in numbers, it\u2019s becoming more racially and ethnically diverse and the population is aging. But according to a new analysis by Pew Research Center, these trends are playing out differently across community types. Urban areas are at the leading edge of racial and ethnic change, with nonwhites now a clear majority of the population in urban counties while solid majorities in suburban and rural areas are white. Urban and suburban counties are gaining population due to an influx of immigrants in both types of counties, as well as domestic migration into suburban areas. In contrast, rural counties have made only minimal gains since 2000 as the number of people leaving for urban or suburban areas has outpaced the number moving in. And while the population is graying in all three types of communities, this is happening more rapidly in the suburbs than in urban and rural counties. At the same time, urban and rural communities are becoming increasingly different from each other politically. Adults in urban counties, long aligned with the Democratic Party, have moved\u00a0even more to the left in recent years, and today twice as many urban voters identify as Democrats or lean Democratic as affiliate with the Republican Party. For their part, rural adults have moved more firmly into the Republican camp. More than half (54%) of rural voters now identify with or lean to the GOP, while 38% are Democrats or lean Democratic. Against this backdrop, a new Pew Research Center survey finds that many urban and rural residents feel misunderstood and looked down on by Americans living in other types of communities.

Share: Facebook Twitter Pinterest LinkedIN Email FULL STORY As cities around the world continue to draw young people for work, education, and social opportunities, a new study identifies characteristics that would support young urban dwellers' mental health. The findings, based on survey responses from a global panel that included adolescents and young adults, provide a set of priorities that city planners can adopt to build urban environments that are safe, equitable, and inclusive. To determine city characteristics that could bolster youth mental health, researchers administered an initial survey to a panel of more than 400, including young people and a multidisciplinary group of researchers, practitioners, and advocates. Through two subsequent surveys, participants prioritized six characteristics that would support young city dwellers' mental health: opportunities to build life skills; age-friendly environments that accept young people's feelings and values; free and safe public spaces where young people can connect; employment and job security; interventions that address the social determinants of healt",

That\u2019s why, over the years, more and more people begin to consider moving to a smaller town. But is that really what you want?

Of course, both options have some pros and cons, so if you want to move but don\u2019t have to move to a specific town or city for work-related reasons, you should take a moment to make the right choice. The perfect destination for you depends on your priorities, and on what you want the most out of your life. Whether you are moving to a small town like London or a big city like Toronto, there are pros and cons of each. Either way, your next move should be an exciting new adventure. Are you alone, or with a family? What kind of lifestyle do you most enjoy, or do you wish you had? What are your expectations? Let\u2019s try to settle the small town vs big city debate to help you choose the best option for you: 1. Cost of living There are many factors to determine between living in a small town vs big city, but it all boils down on one key decision: the cost of living. Everything tends to be more expensive in a big city than in a small town. Renting or buying a home, buying groceries, and even shopping for clothes will probably be a lot more affordable in a small town. If you want to save some money, this is something you should keep in mind. That being said, if you know you can get a job with a big salary in a big city, you will easily be able to afford the higher cost of living. 2. Job market If you want to search for a job in a small town, you might be able to find one without too much competition. Of course, there are more jobs available in a big city, and you might even be able to find a job that pays more, so you can afford to rent an apartment or buy a house. However, finding your dream job might be more difficult, since many people will want the same one. 3. Crime rate If you want to move to a neighbourhood where you and your children will feel safe, a quiet small town could be the right choice for you. Big cities tend to have higher crime rates than small towns, but of course, it varies",

This calculator allows you to compare the cost of living in different locations. To do this we first calculate average living expenses based on your current location and desired location. These expenses are adjusted based on your annual income and household size. Next, the tax category uses tax data at the federal, state and local level to determine estimated tax burden. We then calculate the percentage difference between your current and desired locations in the categories of taxes, housing and food. Finally, we use these percentages to calculate the annual income that would give you a comparable standard of living in your desired location. \u2022 Adults: 1 = Single, Adults: 2 = Married filing jointly. \u2022 Number of children equals the number of dependents. \u2022 Otherwise assume all deductions and retirement account contributions are zero. \u2022 Number of personal exemptions is equal to the number of individuals in the household. Meaning, a single person is 1, a married couple is 2 and any additional children are counted as an additional individual.

If you live and work in an urban setting, imagine for a minute what it might be like to live in a rural setting. Often, people believe rural settings have fewer opportunities than urban ones, and may gravitate towards living and working in a larger community. However, it\u2019s important to understand that both urban and rural settings offer great opportunities for an organization to grow and be successful\u2014they just work in different ways. Many of ROI\u2019s staff have worked in both rural and urban settings. Here, we share some insights on the differences we\u2019ve observed working for nonprofit organizations in both types of communities. We\u2019ve found that they both creatively use resources to succeed and grow. In rural areas, connecting with a local school superintendent, sheriff, director of social services, or other key community leaders may be as simple as emailing and asking for a meeting. However, the same course of action in an urban setting will likely take months or even years of trying before successfully communicating with officials.\u00a0 This is because in rural areas, leaders serve a smaller population, often leaving more breathing room to help community organizations and build relationships with them. Urban officials often have large populations to tend to, making them less accessible to nonprofit organizations. Generally, compared to rural settings urban settings have access to many important resources. Urban organizations often receive more funding from investors and have larger populations to assist with their needs. In fact, only 3% of philanthropic dollars are allocated to rural communities in the US. However, when so much is at your fingertips, you might overlook opportunities to learn from others. This can mean your organization could miss out on collaborating with other organizations who ",

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK Rural-urban differences in the labor-force impacts of COVID-19 in the United States Matthew M Brooks J Tom Mueller Brian C Thiede Denotes corresponding author, mfb5341@psu.edu Issue date 2021 Jan-Dec. Abstract COVID-19 has had dramatic impacts on economic outcomes across the United States, yet most research on the pandemic\u2019s labor-market impacts has had a national or urban focus. We overcome this limitation using data from the U.S. Current Population Survey\u2019s COVID-19 supplement to study pandemic-related labor-force outcomes in rural and urban areas from May 2020 through February 2021. We find the pandemic has generally had more severe labor-force impacts on urban adults than their rural counterparts. Urban adults were more often unable to work, go unpaid for missed hours, and be unable to look for work due to COVID-19. However, rural workers were less likely to work remotely than urban workers. These differences persist even when adjusting for adults\u2019 socioeconomic characteristics and state-level factors. Our results suggest rural-urban differences in the nature of work during the pandemic cannot be explained by well-known demographic and political differences between rural and urban America.

That narrative holds some truth: rural America has a declining population, along with lower educational attainment and lower workforce participation than urban America. But while rural America certainly faces challenges, it also has its own strengths and assets.

What Is a Good Job? We define a good job as one that pays a minimum of approximately $43,000 to workers ages 25\u201344, a minimum of approximately $55,000 to workers ages 45\u201364, and a median of approximately $82,000 for all good jobs (in 2022 dollars).

In order to achieve this goal, the Federal Reserve steadily raised interest rates to historic levels, reaching 20 percent in 1981. Though Volcker ultimately succeeded in reducing inflation, it had many side effects. The ensuing recession, a strong dollar, and tax reforms accelerated the transition of the U.S. economy from manufacturing to a service-based economy. Manufacturing jobs, which peaked at 19.5 million in 1979, fell to under 11.5 million during the pandemic, while employment in finance and professional and business services soared from 12 million to 32 million. This economic shift brought with it a demographic realignment, with population growth concentrating in large metros where service industries thrived. While it remains uncertain whether we are now witnessing another such shift, Census data released over the summer shows that the demographic trends that have persisted this decade are unlike any seen since before 1980.

This also means that their renter journey will look a little different too. It\u2019s less about having huge spaces, private backyards, or settling down in the suburbs. Instead, a majority of millennials consider community amenities a higher priority than anything else in addition to a location that is nearby to work and friends and flexible leasing terms. Different things will be important to different people, but most millennials can agree on the top amenities that they hope to have within their chosen rental community. Apartment communities that not only allow pets, but also include them by offering things such as a dog park or pet spa will make an impression with millennial renters. Other common area spaces like outdoor entertainment areas, fitness centers and co-working rooms are also high on the list. Don\u2019t forget about smart home features or the power that convenience will have on a renter\u2019s ultimate decision on where they live. Additionally, this new age renter simply wants to live somewhere they can rely on so having strong communication with residents and also regularly engaging with them by hosting events is a must. Pet-Friendly Communities It\u2019s no secret that millennials value their four-legged friend\u2019s companionship as they often search for communities that offer dog parks, sanitary dog waste stations, and any additional amenities that will help their pets live their best lives. In fact, millennials are currently the largest segment of pet owners so it\u2019s crucial to have pet-friendly community amenities that will cater to these needs. Developed and managed by P.B.

Thanks to the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA), cities have access to over $65 billion in State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds (SLFRF) to help their communities recover.

Executive Summary The COVID-19 pandemic forced Americans across the country to reconsider their community preferences. Today, many Americans would prefer to live in small towns or rural areas rather than denser urban neighborhoods, and they are more likely to prioritize personal space over access to community amenities. When it comes to rating their communities, White Americans are more positive about their neighborhoods than are Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans. But White Americans are also less optimistic about the future of their communities than other groups are. Forty-three percent of Asian Americans, 42 percent of Black Americans, and 39 percent of Hispanic Americans say their communities will get better in the near future, compared to 30 percent of White Americans. Many Americans live close to at least some local amenities. Close proximity to amenities such as caf\u00e9s and parks increases neighborliness, feelings of safety, social trust, and positive feelings about the community. For Americans living in urban and suburban areas, greater amenity access is linked to higher levels of trust. More than three-quarters of high-amenity urbanites (76 percent) and su",

Community leaders are looking to enhance the vibrancy and desirability of their cities, and those grappling with how to recover a sense of community connection in the wake of COVID-19 and a national racial reckoning, can look to the Community Ties study to better understand the key role played by the arts.\u00a0 Out of a dozen urban amenities studied, local arts and cultural amenities stood out for their potential to boost resident satisfaction, civic engagement and ties to the community.

Contents How Urban Living Stimulates Cognitive Growth Urban environments are often buzzing with sensory and intellectual stimulation. For some, this constant activity can enhance cognitive function by providing opportunities to learn, adapt, and innovate. Exposure to Diverse Stimuli Cities bombard the brain with visual, auditory, and social stimuli\u2014billboards, traffic noise, and cultural events. This exposure pushes the brain to process and prioritize information quickly, strengthening working memory and decision-making. Opportunities for Lifelong Learning Urban areas often have rich educational resources, from museums and libraries to workshops and networking events. These opportunities encourage continuous learning, which keeps the brain sharp and adaptable. Fostering Creativity and Innovation The diverse mix of people and ideas in cities fuels creativity. Interacting with individuals from different backgrounds and perspectives encourages the brain to think more flexibly and solve problems in innovative ways. The Cognitive Challenges of Urban Life While urban living can stimulate the brain, it also presents challenges that may hinder cognitive function, especially when mental overload becomes a factor. Dealing with Noise Pollution Constant exposure to noise\u2014from traffic to construction\u2014can increase stress levels and impair focus. Over time, this sensory overload may impact memory and concentration.

Whether you\u2019re seeking the fast-paced opportunities of city life or the serenity of rural landscapes, we\u2019ve got you covered. Table of Contents Urban Vs Rural (A Comparison) Defining Urban vs. Rural Urban Areas Urban areas are typically characterized by high population density and significant human infrastructure. They encompass cities and towns where people live in close proximity to one another. These regions are hubs of economic, cultural, and social activities.\u00a0 Urban areas are marked by tall buildings, well-developed transportation systems, and access to various amenities such as hospitals, schools, shopping centers, and entertainment options. Rural Areas In contrast, rural areas are sparsely populated regions that are predominantly agricultural or natural in nature. These areas often consist of small villages, farmlands, and open spaces. Rural life is closely tied to agriculture, with communities relying on farming and livestock for their livelihoods.\u00a0 Unlike urban areas, rural communities tend to have fewer public services and amenities, with larger distances between homes and businesses.

In examining the nuances of urban vs rural societal roles, one can appreciate how these environments foster different employment opportunities, social networks, and access to essential services. Analyzing these factors reveals the intricate balance that sustains communities across diverse landscapes. Table of Contents Overview of Societal Structures Societal structures represent the organized frameworks through which communities operate, encompassing the relationships, institutions, and roles that shape human interaction. These structures are influenced by various factors including geography, economy, and culture, thus creating distinct urban vs rural societal roles. In urban areas, societal structures tend to be more complex and diverse due to higher population densities and varied economic activities. The presence of numerous institutions like corporations, educational facilities, and healthcare services facilitates a dynamic social environment, reflecting an intricate web of roles. Conversely, rural societal structures are often characterized by closer-knit communities and more homogenous job sectors. Here, roles are frequently tied to agriculture and local services, influencing social interactions and support systems, which differ significantly from urban settings. Understanding these varied societal roles is crucial in examining economic impacts and social dynamics, as they shape daily life and communal support in both urban and rural environments. Historical Context of Urban and Rural Societal Roles Urban and rural societal roles have evolved significantly throughout history, reflecting changing economic, social, and technological contexts.

Atherton, 3695 Cullen Blvd, Room 229D, Houston, TX 77204. oeatherton@uh.edu Issue date 2024 Feb. Abstract One large focus of personality psychology is to understand the biopsychosocial factors responsible for adult personality development and well-being change. However, little is known about how macro-level contextual factors, such as rurality-urbanicity, are related to personality development and well-being change. The present study uses data from two large longitudinal studies of U.S. Americans (MIDUS, HRS) to examine whether there are rural-urban differences in levels and changes in the Big Five personality traits and well-being (i.e., psychological well-being, life satisfaction) in adulthood. Multilevel models showed that Americans who lived in more rural areas tended to have lower levels of openness, conscientiousness, and psychological well-being, and higher levels of neuroticism. With the exception of psychological well-being (which replicated across MIDUS and HRS), rural-urban differences in personality traits were only evident in the HRS sample. The effect of neuroticism was fully robust to the inclusion of socio-demographic and social network covariates, but other effects were partially robust (i.e., conscientiousness, openness) or were not robust at all (i.e., psychological well-being). In both samples, there were no rural-urban differences in Big Five or well-be",

        "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, let's talk about something really important today: the future of young people. We firmly believe that escaping from big cities, not returning to them, is the way forward for today\u2019s youth.  We're here to examine the realities facing young people and how this shift can truly empower them.\n\nNow, what do we mean by \"escaping big cities\"? We're talking about young people choosing to build their lives and careers in smaller towns, rural areas, or suburban communities. Places where life is more affordable, community ties are stronger, and opportunities are perhaps a little less conventional but no less valuable.\n\nOur argument rests on three key pillars: affordability, civic engagement, and stronger communities. Let's explore each of these.\n\nFirst, let's talk about affordability.  Think about trying to buy your first home.  It's a dream for many, but in big cities, it feels more like a fantasy.  The numbers tell a stark story: 81% of millennials in rural areas own homes, compared to just 58% in urban areas. That's a huge difference! Why? Because housing costs significantly less in smaller towns. Plus, there are programs like USDA loans specifically designed to help first-time homebuyers in rural areas. Escaping the city breaks the cycle of sky-high rents and lets young people invest in their future through *affordable homeownership*. This builds equity, provides financial security, and sets the stage for long-term stability.  It's about building a solid foundation, not just chasing an expensive dream.\n\nSecond, consider this: how much influence do you really have in a big city?  Smaller communities offer young people a chance to truly engage and make a difference. Tufts University\u2019s CIRCLE, a leading research center on civic engagement, highlights how crucial youth involvement is for both individual and community well-being. They emphasize the need for supportive environments that empower young people to take action.  Smaller communities naturally provide this support.  It's easier to connect with local government and community organizations.  Your voice is heard, and your contributions matter.  In smaller populations, diverse perspectives are needed and valued. This translates to real opportunities for leadership and direct involvement in shaping your community.  While big cities have resources, their sheer size can make individual efforts feel like a drop in the ocean. Smaller communities offer a tangible sense of impact, empowering youth to shape their environment and see the direct results of their engagement.\n\nFinally, let's talk about community.  Think about your closest friends.  Where did you meet them?  How did those relationships develop?  Studies show a link between urban living and decreased mental well-being due to social isolation. The constant hustle and competition in big cities can make it hard to build deep, meaningful connections.  Smaller towns offer a different experience. They're built on close-knit relationships and community involvement.  This fosters a strong sense of belonging and helps create lasting bonds.  While big cities offer diverse social scenes, their size and anonymity can make it tough to establish roots.  The close-knit fabric of smaller communities provides fertile ground for nurturing stronger, more meaningful relationships, ultimately leading to a higher quality of life.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities offers young people a path to a more fulfilling and prosperous future.  By embracing the affordability, civic engagement, and stronger communities found outside major metropolitan areas, young people can build lives grounded in financial security, meaningful contributions, and lasting relationships. We urge you to affirm the motion and support a future where young people can thrive, not just survive.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1.

        "Friends, neighbors, fellow citizens, have you ever felt that squeeze, that pressure of city life?  The crowded commutes, the sky-high rent, the constant hustle?  Many of us have.  And it's tempting to dream of escaping to a quieter, seemingly more affordable life in a smaller town.  Our opponents today paint a rosy picture of this escape, but I'm here to tell you, they're overlooking some crucial details.\n\nThey talk about financial stability.  Sure, houses might *look* cheaper in smaller towns. But let's be real, how much is that house worth if you can't find a decent-paying job?  Census data consistently reveals lower median incomes and higher poverty rates in rural communities.  Think about it \u2013 a lower-priced home doesn't mean much when you're earning less.  It's like seeing a great deal on a fancy coffee maker when you can barely afford groceries.  Yes, remote work is growing, but it doesn't magically create high-paying jobs everywhere.  Competition for these remote positions is fierce, and many still require you to be close to a big city for meetings and networking.  So, while the initial price tag on a house might be lower, the long-term financial picture is often much bleaker.  We believe that big cities, with their diverse job markets and higher earning potential, offer a much stronger path to financial security.\n\nNow, let's talk about well-being.  Our opponents praise the slower pace of life and the access to green spaces.  And yes, those things are nice.  But they conveniently ignore the challenges of accessing quality healthcare, especially mental healthcare, in smaller communities.  Imagine needing specialized care and having to drive hours to the nearest specialist.  A 2023 study in *Cities & Health* actually shows a correlation between urban density and mental health issues, but it *also* highlights the greater availability of mental health resources in urban areas.  Big cities offer a wider range of therapists, support groups, and specialized treatment options.  Plus, that \"slower pace of life\" can quickly become isolating, especially for young people looking for opportunities and connections.  Big cities offer a vibrant cultural scene, diverse social opportunities, and a constant flow of new ideas.  This can be incredibly enriching and stimulating, fostering creativity and a sense of belonging.\n\nFinally, let's address the claim about career opportunities.  Our opponents point to the rise of remote work, but they fail to mention the *quality* and *variety* of those opportunities.  A 2024 Upwork survey shows a rise in remote work, but it doesn't tell us what *kinds* of jobs are available or where they're located.  Many remote positions still require you to be near a big city for client meetings and networking events.  And what about starting your own business?  Smaller communities often have smaller markets, fewer investors, and less access to the resources entrepreneurs need.  Big cities, on the other hand, are hubs for startups and small businesses.  They offer access to talent, capital, and a supportive network of other entrepreneurs.  A 2023 Small Business Administration report shows that small businesses created millions of jobs, but it doesn't break down the geographic distribution of these jobs.  Many of these new businesses are concentrated in urban areas, where they can thrive.\n\nSo, while the idea of escaping the city might sound appealing, the reality is often more complicated.  Big cities offer greater financial opportunities, better access to resources, and a more stimulating environment for personal and professional growth.  These are crucial factors for young people building their futures.  We believe that big cities, while not without their challenges, offer a more robust and promising path to a successful and fulfilling life.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1.

        "Friends, let\u2019s talk about what truly gives today\u2019s young people the best future.  Think about what really matters: a good life, strong relationships, and a real sense of belonging. Our opponents paint a rosy picture of big-city life, but let\u2019s be real, is that the whole story?\n\nThey talk about jobs, but haven't they heard of working from home?  Startups are booming everywhere, not just in skyscrapers.  They mention higher *potential* salaries, but forget about that tiny apartment eating up your paycheck.  When was the last time you looked at rent prices in a big city?  Forget owning a home \u2013 you\u2019re stuck renting forever.  They boast about city amenities, but what about real connections?  What about breathing fresh air and knowing your neighbors?\n\nEscaping the city isn't about *limiting* opportunities, it's about *creating* them.  Think about it: lower cost of living, wages rising in smaller towns \u2013 you're actually saving money, building a future.  Our opponents brought up Manhattan versus Bend, Oregon, but that\u2019s just one piece of the puzzle.  The Richmond Fed, MoneyMow, and Aditya Birla Capital all show how much cheaper it is to live in smaller communities across the board.  That\u2019s money in *your* pocket.\n\nAnd what about community?  According to the International City/County Management Association (ICMA) and the National Association of Development Organizations (NADO), close-knit communities are key for happiness and well-being.  In a small town, you're not just a face in the crowd.  You can actually make a difference.  Tufts University\u2019s CIRCLE research shows how young people in smaller towns are shaping their communities.\n\nSo, let\u2019s choose a future where young people can thrive, not just survive.  A future built on financial security, strong relationships, and real community.  Let\u2019s choose a future where our kids can build their *own* success story.  Vote to escape the city, and embrace a brighter future.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n1. https://www.moneymow.com/small-town-vs-big-city-what-are-the-pros-and-cons/\n2. https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/abc-of-money/cost-of-living-in-big-cities-vs-small-cities/\n3. https://www.richmondfed.org/region_communities/regional_data_analysis/regional_matters/2024/rm_08_15_24_labor_shortages_rural_urban\n4. https://icma.org/small-towns-rural-communities-and-sustainability\n5. https://www.nado.org/vibrant-rural-communities-case-study-series/\n6. https://circle.tufts.edu/understanding-youth-civic-engagement\n\n"

        "In this debate, we shall argue that escaping big cities, defined as relocating from a major metropolitan area to a smaller town, suburb, or rural area, is the optimal \"way out,\" or path towards a better future encompassing improved well-being, financial stability, and personal fulfillment, for young people (individuals aged 18-35).\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing overall well-being for young people, encompassing mental and physical health, financial security, and community engagement. This framework is appropriate because the motion concerns the best \"way out\" for young people, implying a focus on their overall quality of life.\n\nFirst, escaping big cities allows young people to achieve greater financial stability.  The high cost of living, particularly housing, in major metropolitan areas presents a significant barrier to financial security for young people.  For example, a 2022 report by the National Low Income Housing Coalition found that in no state, including rural areas, could a full-time minimum wage worker afford a modest two-bedroom rental unit. (1)  Escaping to smaller towns and rural areas, where the cost of living is generally lower, enables young people to allocate their income more effectively, save for the future, and pursue opportunities for homeownership, all contributing to enhanced financial well-being.  The median home price in Q4 2023 in Manhattan, NY was \\$1 million, while the median home price in Bend, OR (a popular smaller city destination) was $535,000. (2)  This substantial difference in housing costs demonstrates the financial advantages of escaping big cities, freeing up resources for other important life goals.\n\nSecond, escaping big cities improves mental and physical well-being.  The fast-paced, competitive, and often isolating environment of large urban centers can negatively impact mental health, leading to increased stress, anxiety, and depression.  A 2023 study published in the journal \"Cities & Health\" found a positive correlation between urban density and mental health issues among young adults. (3) Conversely, smaller communities often offer stronger social connections, increased access to nature, and a slower pace of life, all factors that contribute to improved mental and physical well-being.  Access to green spaces and outdoor recreational activities, often more readily available in smaller communities, promotes physical activity and reduces stress, as highlighted in a 2021 report by the World Health Organization. (4)\n\nThird, escaping big cities opens up diverse career and entrepreneurial opportunities. While certain industries may be concentrated in major metropolitan areas, the rise of remote work, the growth of the gig economy, and the increasing availability of high-speed internet in smaller towns and rural areas are creating a more geographically diverse job market.  A 2024 survey by Upwork found that 26.7% of the American workforce worked remotely. (5)  This allows young people to pursue careers in fields of their choice, regardless of location, while enjoying the benefits of a smaller community.  Furthermore, escaping big cities can foster entrepreneurship, as lower startup costs and a supportive local environment can encourage young people to launch their own businesses, contributing to both personal fulfillment and local economic development. A 2023 report by the Small Business Administration found that small businesses created 1.9 million net new jobs in 2022. (6)  This entrepreneurial spirit can revitalize smaller communities while offering young people a path towards self-sufficiency and career satisfaction.\n\nIn conclusion, escaping big cities provides a path towards a better future for young people, offering enhanced financial stability, improved mental and physical well-being, and diverse career and entrepreneurial opportunities. By embracing a life outside the confines of major metropolitan areas, young people can maximize their overall well-being and build a more fulfilling future.\n\nReference:\n(1) National Low Income Housing Coalition.

        "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are the alleged financial instability, lack of well-being, and limited career opportunities they associate with escaping large metropolitan areas.  Our side contends that escaping big cities offers young people a path to a more fulfilling life, encompassing financial security, enhanced well-being, and diverse career opportunities.  This holistic approach to a young person's future is what truly defines the best \"way out.\"\n\nFirst, the opponent argues that lower incomes in smaller towns negate the financial benefits of lower housing costs.  While it's true that incomes *can* be lower in some smaller towns, the opponent overlooks the significantly lower overall cost of living.  Accommodation costs, for example, are demonstrably lower in small towns. As resources like MoneyMow and Aditya Birla Capital point out, housing costs are generally much higher in cities.  This difference is not just about the sticker price of a house; it's about the overall cost of living, including groceries, transportation, and entertainment, which are all typically lower in smaller communities.  This allows for a higher disposable income and greater financial security, even with potentially lower salaries. Moreover, certain smaller cities are actively attracting young talent with financial incentives, further bolstering their financial prospects.  The BBC, for instance, has reported on US cities offering up to $15,000 to relocate.  Furthermore, the Richmond Fed reported in 2024 that wage growth in smaller cities and rural areas has been outpacing urban areas.  This, combined with lower overall living costs, contributes to greater financial stability for young people escaping big cities.\n\nSecond, they claim that smaller communities lack access to quality healthcare and lead to social isolation. This ignores the transformative growth and effectiveness of telehealth and remote healthcare services, which are bridging the gap in access to specialists. Resources like the NCBI highlight the growth of telehealth, particularly fueled by advancements in healthcare IT.  Furthermore, research by organizations like the NADO and ICMA points to the significant social capital and strong community support networks prevalent in smaller towns, directly countering the claim of social isolation. These tight-knit communities actively foster social connections and support, particularly beneficial for young families. While big cities offer a variety of amenities, studies have shown the negative impact of factors like long commutes and lack of access to nature, as highlighted by research from the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Harvard University.  These factors contribute to increased stress and reduced well-being, drawbacks often overlooked by the opposition.  The slower pace of life and increased access to nature found in smaller towns actively promote both mental and physical health, crucial components of our overall well-being framework.\n\n\nThird, the opponent\u2019s assertion that big cities offer superior career opportunities is outdated in today's increasingly remote work environment. Forbes Advisor reports that 71% of remote workers find remote work improves their work-life balance, and 65% want to work remotely full-time.  This flexibility enables young people to live where they choose, decoupling location from career opportunities. The growth of remote work, as evidenced by companies like Aquent, PNC Bank, and Splunk embracing fully remote positions, allows individuals to pursue fulfilling careers regardless of location. Additionally, SCORE reports that rural small businesses show comparable revenue and profit to urban counterparts, demonstrating the viability of entrepreneurship in smaller communities.  The lower startup costs and supportive local environments in these areas, often coupled with initiatives like the creation of \"third spaces\" reported by Farmers Advance, can foster a thriving entrepreneurial ecosystem.  Resources like Business Model Analyst offer numerous examples of successful startups in smaller communities, including grocery stores, auto repair shops, and carpentry businesses. These examples highlight the diverse opportunities available outside of major metropolitan areas, catering to a range of skills and interests.\n\n\nReference:\n(1) https://savingtoinvest.com/monthly-budget-comparison-big-city-10000-vs-small-town-4000/\n(2) https://www.moneymow.com/small-town-vs-big-city-what-are-the-pros-and-cons/\n(3) https://upgradedhome.com/small-town-living-vs-big-city/\n(4) https://www.adityabirlacapital.com/abc-of-money/cost-of-living-in-big-cities-vs-small-cities/\n(5) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-57516592\n(6) https://www.richmondfed.org/region_communities/regional_data_analysis/regional_matters/2024/rm_08_15_24_labor_shortages_rural_urban\n(7) https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7577680/\n(8) https://www.nado.org/vibrant-rural-communities-case-study-series/\n(9) https://icma.org/small-towns-rural-communities-and-sustainability\n(10) https://search.library.wisc.edu/article/cdi_crossref_primary_10_1016_j_jebo_2021_10_028\n(11) https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/time-spent-in-nature-can-boost-physical-and-mental-well-being/\n(12) https://www.forbes.com/advisor/business/remote-work-statistics/\n(13) https://money.usnews.com/careers/articles/big-companies-that-hire-remote-workers/\n(14) https://www.score.org/resource/infographic/infographic-rural-entrepreneurship\n(15) https://businessmodelanalyst.com/small-town-business-ideas/\n(16) https://www.farmersadvance.com/story/life/2024/05/16/theres-hope-in-small-towns/73717279007\n\n\n\n\n\n",
        "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today\u2019s debate centers on a fundamental question: what truly offers young people the best path forward? We firmly believe it lies not in returning to the clamor of big cities, but in embracing the opportunities found in escaping them.\n\nThe opposition argues that big cities offer superior financial prospects.  Yet, they overlook a simple truth:  a larger paycheck doesn't equate to greater financial security when the cost of living consumes every gain. While Manhattan boasts higher average salaries, Bend, Oregon, a thriving hub for young professionals, offers a comparable quality of life at a fraction of the cost. This allows young people to build wealth, not just tread water.  Moreover, the rise of remote work is not just about flexibility; it's about democratizing opportunity, allowing young people to contribute to innovative industries from anywhere, unshackling their potential from expensive urban centers.\n\nThe opposition also raises concerns about healthcare access in smaller communities.  However, they fail to account for the transformative impact of telehealth, which is rapidly bridging geographical barriers and connecting individuals with specialists across the country.  Furthermore, we\u2019ve highlighted the rich social fabric of smaller communities.  This isn\u2019t just about friendly neighbors; it\u2019s about a deep sense of belonging and mutual support, an environment where young families thrive and individuals find genuine connection \u2013 a stark contrast to the often isolating experience of big city life.\n\nFinally, the opposition\u2019s argument regarding career opportunities rests on an outdated paradigm.  They claim that smaller communities lack the dynamic job markets of big cities.  Yet, they ignore the vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystems flourishing in these very towns.  Lower startup costs, coupled with supportive local networks, empower young people to build their own businesses, contributing to both personal and community growth. This isn't just about finding a job; it's about forging your own path.\n\nEscaping big cities is not a rejection of ambition; it's a redefinition of success. It's about choosing a life grounded in genuine connection, balanced living, and the pursuit of self-actualization. It's about building a life of purpose, not just a career.  It's about choosing a life, not just a location. And that, esteemed judges, is the true way out, the path towards a richer, more fulfilling future for young people.\n\n\n"
