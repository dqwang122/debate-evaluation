      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that a fat tax, defined as a levy on foods and beverages high in fat, sugar, and/or salt, should be implemented to improve public health outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is the net societal benefit.  We will demonstrate that the benefits of a fat tax, including improved public health outcomes, revenue generation for health initiatives, and positive changes in consumer behavior, outweigh any potential negative consequences.\n\nFirst, a fat tax improves public health by reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and generating revenue for health initiatives.  Hungary's implementation of a similar tax resulted in an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed beverages (6). This demonstrates the potential for a fat tax to drive positive dietary changes.  The generated revenue can then be invested in public health programs targeting obesity prevention and education, magnifying the positive impact.  For example, revenue could fund subsidized healthy food programs, further encouraging healthier choices.\n\nSecond, a fat tax encourages positive shifts in consumer behavior.  When faced with increased prices on unhealthy options, consumers are more likely to seek healthier alternatives (4). This shift in consumption patterns contributes to a healthier population in the long term. As consumers adapt to the new pricing structure, they become more conscious of their food choices, fostering a culture of health and wellness.\n\nThird, the negative consequences of a fat tax can be mitigated through careful implementation and targeted support for low-income groups.  Concerns about regressive impacts can be addressed by using the generated revenue to subsidize healthy food options for low-income families (9). This ensures that healthier choices are accessible to all, regardless of income level. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can educate consumers on healthy eating habits and the rationale behind the tax, increasing acceptance and promoting positive behavioral change.\n\nIn conclusion, a fat tax, implemented strategically and thoughtfully, offers a significant net benefit to society by improving public health, encouraging positive consumer behavior changes, and generating revenue for targeted health initiatives.\n\nReference:\n(1)  FasterCapital.

      "content": "Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s talk about something that affects us all: food.  More specifically, the idea of a \u201cfat tax\u201d \u2013 a tax on foods high in sugar, fat, or salt.  Now, while the intention might seem good \u2013 encouraging healthier eating \u2013 we believe this approach is ultimately flawed and will do more harm than good. We\u2019re here to argue against imposing a fat tax.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about fairness. Think about your weekly grocery bill.  Now imagine if everything from a can of soda to a bag of chips suddenly became more expensive.  For many of us, that would be a noticeable pinch. But for families already struggling to make ends meet, it could be devastating.  *This isn\u2019t just a hypothetical scenario.*  A study in *The Lancet* showed that fat taxes hit low-income households the hardest (1).  They spend a larger portion of their income on food, so these taxes take a bigger bite out of their budgets. Remember the proposed soda tax in New York? It faced huge backlash because people recognized it would unfairly burden the poorest residents.  Simply redirecting the tax revenue to health programs doesn't solve the core problem \u2013 it\u2019s still taking more from those who can least afford it. We need solutions that promote healthy eating *without* punishing the poor.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s consider whether these taxes actually work.  Think about it \u2013 if the price of your favorite snack doubles, will you really stop eating it altogether?  You might buy less, sure, but you might also just switch to a slightly cheaper, equally unhealthy option. Or maybe you cut back on something else entirely, like fresh fruits and vegetables.  *Research backs this up.*  Several studies, including a comprehensive systematic review, have shown that people often find ways around these taxes (2, 3, 4). They substitute one unhealthy item for another, or they simply adjust their spending in other areas.  Remember the Danish saturated fat tax?  They tried it, and it barely made a dent in overall saturated fat intake. People just changed their shopping habits.  The tax was eventually repealed.  This shows us that simply taxing specific foods is unlikely to change overall consumption patterns.  While some suggest reinvesting the tax revenue, this avoids the real issue \u2013 people aren\u2019t necessarily eating healthier, and low-income families are still bearing the brunt of the cost.\n\nThird, let\u2019s look at the impact on businesses. Imagine you own a small grocery store.  Suddenly, demand for certain products drops because of a new tax.  That\u2019s lost revenue, and it can have a real impact on your livelihood.  A 2024 review in *Food Policy* analyzed 20 studies and found clear evidence of decreased sales and consumption of taxed foods, directly affecting industry revenues (5, 6).  The Danish fat tax, for example, led to more people crossing the border to shop and created huge administrative headaches for businesses.  It was repealed after just 15 months.  This illustrates the negative ripple effect these taxes can have.  While businesses might try to adapt by changing their products, that takes time and money, and it might not make up for the lost sales (7).  Plus, focusing on penalizing certain foods distracts us from the bigger picture \u2013 we need to educate people about healthy eating and make healthy options accessible to everyone.\n\nSo, let\u2019s recap.  Fat taxes disproportionately affect low-income families, they don\u2019t effectively reduce consumption, and they harm the food industry.  Instead of punishing people for their food choices, let\u2019s focus on real solutions.  We need to educate people about nutrition, improve access to healthy, affordable food, and encourage positive lifestyle changes.  Let\u2019s reject this fat tax and work together to build a healthier future for everyone.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are the supposed effectiveness of revenue redirection, the assumption of long-term behavior change, and the downplaying of the negative impact on businesses.\n\nFirst, the affirmative argues that a fat tax improves public health and that revenue generated can be used to fund health initiatives, mitigating the regressive impact on low-income families. However, even with revenue redirection, the initial increased cost of food burdens low-income households, restricting their choices and potentially leading to substitutions with cheaper, less healthy options. This financial strain disproportionately affects those already struggling to afford nutritious food, exacerbating existing health disparities. A study published in *The Lancet* (1) demonstrated that during the 2008 financial crisis, families facing economic hardship often substituted nutritious foods with less healthy alternatives due to price increases. This illustrates how a fat tax, even with revenue reallocation, can worsen dietary habits in vulnerable populations.\n\nSecond, the affirmative assumes that a fat tax encourages positive long-term shifts in consumer behavior.  However, this overlooks the fact that short-term reductions in the consumption of taxed items do not necessarily translate to sustained healthy habits.  The Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed just 15 months later (2), serves as a prime example. While initial sales of taxed items decreased, consumers often substituted them with equally unhealthy alternatives or crossed borders to purchase preferred foods.  This ultimately resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake and highlighted the ineffectiveness of the tax in achieving long-term dietary changes.  Therefore, simply taxing specific foods does not guarantee lasting improvements in dietary habits and may even lead to unintended consequences.\n\nThird, the affirmative minimizes the negative impact of a fat tax on businesses by suggesting that industry adaptation will mitigate these effects. This ignores the considerable costs and logistical challenges faced by businesses in reformulating products, as well as the potential job losses within affected industries.  A 2024 review in *Food Policy* (3) analyzed 20 studies and found that fat taxes consistently resulted in decreased sales of taxed products, impacting industry revenue. This economic burden can be significant, particularly for small businesses that operate on tighter margins and have less capacity to absorb such losses. The Danish fat tax, for instance, led to cross-border shopping and increased administrative burdens for businesses (4), ultimately contributing to its repeal.  The focus on penalizing specific foods, rather than promoting holistic health solutions, misdirects efforts and can have detrimental consequences for the food industry.\n\nReference:\n(1) \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n(2) The Conversation.

      "content": "Friends, neighbors, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects us all: our health.  My opponents raise some concerns about a fat tax, and I want to address them head-on.\n\nFirst, they worry about the impact on vulnerable populations. They argue that increasing food costs will force lower-income families to choose cheaper, less healthy options.  Think about your own grocery bill lately \u2013 we all feel the pinch.  But here's the key: *this tax isn't about taking money away; it's about redirecting it*.  Imagine the revenue generated being used to make healthy foods more affordable for everyone.  That's like a discount at the grocery store, specifically for fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This not only eases the burden on families but also encourages healthier eating habits.  It's a win-win.\n\nSecond, they bring up the Danish fat tax, claiming it didn't work. They say people just bought unhealthy foods elsewhere or switched to different, equally unhealthy options.  But let's be clear: the Danish tax was flawed. It was a small tax, applied inconsistently, and didn't offer healthier alternatives.  It's like trying to fix a leaky roof with a band-aid.  A well-designed fat tax, with a broader scope and paired with incentives for healthy choices, is more likely to create lasting change.  The Danish example isn't a failure of the concept; it's a lesson in *how to do it right*.\n\nThird, they express concern about the impact on businesses. They talk about reformulation costs and potential job losses.  But businesses adapt all the time.  Think about how companies have innovated to meet changing consumer demands in the past. A fat tax would encourage the food industry to develop and market healthier products, creating new opportunities for growth.  Plus, the revenue generated could help businesses transition to healthier product lines, protecting jobs and fostering innovation.  This isn't about punishing businesses; it's about *working together* to create a healthier marketplace.\n\nFourth, they argue that focusing on specific foods is a misdirection of efforts. They again point to the Danish example, highlighting unintended consequences like cross-border shopping.  While the Danish tax had shortcomings, this doesn't negate the potential benefits of a well-designed tax.  Focusing on foods high in sugar, fat, and salt \u2013 the ones linked to chronic diseases \u2013 allows for targeted interventions.  Think about it: if we can reduce consumption of these specific foods, we can make a real difference in public health.  The Danish experience teaches us to be mindful of unintended consequences and design policies that minimize them.  It doesn't invalidate the strategy of using taxation to influence consumer behavior and improve public health.\n\nFinally, let's address the concern about the regressive nature of fat taxes. The goal isn't to punish low-income individuals.  The aim is to incentivize healthier choices and generate revenue for programs that benefit everyone.  This includes subsidizing healthy food options, funding educational campaigns, and supporting community health initiatives.  Studies by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA, 2018) and The Lancet (2009) highlight the importance of addressing the regressive nature of fat taxes.  These studies don't negate the potential public health benefits; they emphasize the need for careful policy design and targeted interventions to mitigate the impact on low-income households.  Education and awareness campaigns can also play a crucial role in promoting healthy eating habits.  By empowering individuals with knowledge and resources, we can create a more equitable and sustainable approach to improving public health.  This is about *investing in our collective well-being*.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

      "content": "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the effectiveness and fairness of a fat tax.\n\nWhile the proposition emphasizes the potential public health benefits and revenue generation, they fail to address the fundamental flaws in this approach.  Their argument hinges on the idea that revenue redirection will mitigate the regressive impact on low-income families. However, this ignores the immediate burden of increased food prices.  Imagine a single mother already struggling to feed her children.  A fat tax, even with eventual subsidies, means she has to choose between less food or less nutritious food *today*.  This immediate impact, before any long-term benefits materialize, exacerbates existing inequalities and undermines the very goal of promoting public health.  Even with subsidies, access to healthy options remains unequal due to factors like food deserts and ingrained cultural preferences.\n\nFurthermore, the proposition\u2019s reliance on the idea that a fat tax encourages long-term behavior change is unsupported by evidence.  The Danish fat tax, a real-world example, demonstrates that consumers often substitute taxed items with equally unhealthy alternatives or simply adjust their spending elsewhere.  This highlights the complexity of behavior change, where price is just one factor among many.  Simply making unhealthy foods more expensive doesn\u2019t magically transform eating habits.  True change requires a holistic approach that empowers individuals through education, access to healthy options, and support for positive lifestyle choices.\n\nFinally, we must consider the value of individual autonomy.  A fat tax, in essence, dictates what people can and cannot eat, infringing on their freedom of choice.  Instead of punishing people for their food choices, we should focus on empowering them with the knowledge and resources they need to make informed decisions.  This respects individual liberty and fosters a more sustainable approach to public health.\n\nReferences:\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

Does a fat tax really make us healthier, or is it just another burden, especially for those already struggling? We believe it\u2019s the latter.\n\nOur opponents say the tax revenue will help, but how does that help families *right now* when they have to choose between less food and less healthy food?  Think about your own grocery bill \u2013 how would an extra tax affect your choices? This immediate impact undermines the very idea of improving public health.\n\nThey also talk about changing long-term habits. But look at what happened in Denmark.  Did the fat tax there change habits? No. People just bought different, sometimes *less* healthy things, or shopped across the border.  According to a study published in *Health Economics*, the Danish fat tax led to a significant increase in cross-border shopping for groceries. This shows we need real solutions, not just higher prices. Our opponents haven\u2019t addressed this at all.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: a fat tax hits low-income families hardest. They spend a bigger part of their income on food. This fact remains unchallenged.  What about the impact on our local food businesses?  Fewer sales, job losses, the cost of changing recipes \u2013 these are real consequences.  A report by the *Institute for Fiscal Studies* highlighted the potential negative impact of a fat tax on the food industry, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nInstead of punishing people with a fat tax, let\u2019s empower them.  Give them the information and the access to healthy, affordable food they need.  This respects our freedom to choose while creating real, lasting change.  A fat tax restricts choice, burdens the vulnerable, and doesn\u2019t guarantee better health.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue.

Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: A Policy Failure Liam Sigaud* Since 2014, eight U.S. cities have implemented sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes. Several other cities and states are contemplating similar measures. SSB taxes are intended to curb sugar consumption and improve public health, but policymakers too often ignore the unintended consequences these measures provoke. This ConsumerGram examines the effects of SSB taxes, including their disproportionate impact on poor households, their failure to meaningfully shift consumers behaviors, and their negative economic effects on local communities. Introduction The debate that Americans, as a whole, consume too much sugar has received much attention recently.1 Research shows that diets high in added sugar contribute to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other chronic conditions.2 To address these public health concerns, some policymakers have embraced targeted \u201csin\u201d taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). In 2014, Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction in the nation to pass an SSB tax. In the years since, several more U.S. cities -- including Seattle, Philadelphia, and San 1 Miller, Paige E., Robin A. McKinnon, Susan M. Krebs-Smith, Amy F.

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

Denmark is abandoning its effort to engineer a slimmer people while filling government coffers: It\u2019s the end for their fat tax on foodstuffs exceeding 2.3% saturated fat content, imposed only last year. So what went wrong? Little that wasn\u2019t predicted and predictable: The tax drove people to cheaper, lower quality, occasionally less fatty alternatives. And it drove Danes, quite literally, across the border to nearby Germany or Sweden to get their favorite foods. Danish television meanwhile scored high with a cooking show that extolled the virtues of butter. But do-gooder politicians have yet to repeal any tax just because it is not working, or impeding the daily lives of citizens. The fat tax was instead fried by Danish farmers complaining of the high administrative cost of fat-tax compliance, and losing business to foreign competitors who were running away with the bacon and the kringles. A planned Danish sugar tax has, for the same reasons, been shelved for now. Even then, no tax will just disappear: Danish politicians plan on filling the $200 million revenue gap left by the fat tax by raising the income tax. That\u2019s richer than those tax-threatened cheeses, since the fat tax came in addition to other taxes, without offsets. Yet the new income tax hike is marketed as offsetting lost revenue! That confirms this tax scheme was never more than a tax-hike masquerading as a public health measure. Health benefits for Danes, only 13% of whom count as obese, seem dubious, and none are being claimed..\u00a0 It\u2019s true that picking customer\u2019s wallets at food-store checkouts can alter behavior, but hardly in the desired direction.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Denmark is abandoning its effort to engineer a slimmer people while filling government coffers: It\u2019s the end for their fat tax on foodstuffs exceeding 2.3% saturated fat content, imposed only last year. So what went wrong? Little that wasn\u2019t predicted and predictable: The tax drove people to cheaper, lower quality, occasionally less fatty alternatives. And it drove Danes, quite literally, across the border to nearby Germany or Sweden to get their favorite foods. Danish television meanwhile scored high with a cooking show that extolled the virtues of butter. But do-gooder politicians have yet to repeal any tax just because it is not working, or impeding the daily lives of citizens. The fat tax was instead fried by Danish farmers complaining of the high administrative cost of fat-tax compliance, and losing business to foreign competitors who were running away with the bacon and the kringles. A planned Danish sugar tax has, for the same reasons, been shelved for now. Even then, no tax will just disappear: Danish politicians plan on filling the $200 million revenue gap left by the fat tax by raising the income tax. That\u2019s richer than those tax-threatened cheeses, since the fat tax came in addition to other taxes, without offsets. Yet the new income tax hike is marketed as offsetting lost revenue! That confirms this tax scheme was never more than a tax-hike masquerading as a public health measure. Health benefits for Danes, only 13% of whom count as obese, seem dubious, and none are being claimed..\u00a0 It\u2019s true that picking customer\u2019s wallets at food-store checkouts can alter behavior, but hardly in the desired direction.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

The Lancet's analysis of \"fat taxes\" reveals their inherent regressivity, demonstrating that low-income households allocate a significantly higher proportion of their income to food, thus bearing a disproportionate burden from the tax (\"0_0\").  For example, the proposed \"soda tax\" in New York drew heavy criticism for its potential to harm the state's poorest citizens. This evidence demonstrates that even well-intentioned fat taxes can have unintended negative consequences, deepening existing socioeconomic disparities. While some argue that revenue from fat taxes could be used to fund health initiatives, this fails to address the core issue of regressivity and its impact on those least able to afford increased food costs.  The focus should be on equitable solutions that promote healthy eating without penalizing the poor.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes are ineffective at reducing overall consumption of targeted foods.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_15', 'query': 'Effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing consumption', 'title': 'Taxation of the fat content of foods for reducing their consumption and ...', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914461/'}, {'id': '0_16', 'query': 'Effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing consumption', 'title': 'Featured Review: Taxation of the fat content of foods for reducing ...', 'url': 'https://www.cochrane.org/news/featured-review-taxation-fat-content-foods-reducing-their-consumption-and-preventing-obesity-or'}, {'id': '0_18', 'query': 'Effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing consumption', 'title': 'Full article: A systematic review of the effectiveness of taxes on ...', 'url': 'https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.2147/CEOR.S49659'}, {'id': '0_45', 'query': 'Unintended consequences of fat taxes', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Sugar-Taxes-ConsumerGram-Final.pdf'}]\n**Long Argument**: A systematic review examining the effects of food taxation on consumption and health outcomes found that the effectiveness of such policies is questionable. The review highlights the complexities of consumer behavior, noting that substitution effects often undermine the intended impact of fat taxes.  For example, consumers may switch from taxed high-fat products to untaxed, but equally unhealthy alternatives, or increase consumption of other unhealthy foods to compensate.  The Danish saturated fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed in 2013, exemplifies this. Despite taxing foods like minced beef and cream, the tax had minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake, as consumers substituted or sought alternative sources. This demonstrates that fat taxes, in isolation, are unlikely to achieve significant reductions in overall consumption of targeted foods. While some argue that fat taxes generate revenue for health initiatives, this does not address the core issue of consumption and may not offset the economic burden on low-income consumers.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Fat taxes can harm the food industry and related businesses.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_2', 'query': 'Impact of fat taxes on food industry profits', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '2_6', 'query': 'Negative effects of fat taxes on food businesses', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods ...', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '2_8', 'query': 'Negative effects of fat taxes on food businesses', 'title': 'Taxes On \"Fatty Foods\", And Their Unintended Consequences - Forbes', 'url': 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2012/11/27/taxes-on-fatty-foods-and-their-unintended-consequences/'}, {'id': '2_20', 'query': 'Effect of fat taxes on food production companies', 'title': 'Obesity, Fat Taxes and Their Effects on Consumers', 'url': 'https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-77045-1_9'}]\n**Long Argument**: A 2024 review in 'Food Policy' analyzed 20 studies on the impact of HFSS food taxes.  The review found evidence of decreased sales and consumption of taxed foods, directly impacting food industry revenues.  While the review notes potential health benefits, the negative economic consequences for businesses are undeniable.  For example, the Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011, led to increased cross-border shopping and high administrative costs for businesses.  This ultimately resulted in the tax's repeal just 15 months later, demonstrating the significant negative impact on the food industry and related sectors.  While some argue that businesses can adapt by reformulating products, this requires significant investment and may not fully offset lost revenue.\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else.

        "statements": "Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s talk about something that affects us all: food.  More specifically, the idea of a \u201cfat tax\u201d \u2013 a tax on foods high in sugar, fat, or salt.  Now, while the intention might seem good \u2013 encouraging healthier eating \u2013 we believe this approach is ultimately flawed and will do more harm than good. We\u2019re here to argue against imposing a fat tax.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about fairness. Think about your weekly grocery bill.  Now imagine if everything from a can of soda to a bag of chips suddenly became more expensive.  For many of us, that would be a noticeable pinch. But for families already struggling to make ends meet, it could be devastating.  *This isn\u2019t just a hypothetical scenario.*  A study in *The Lancet* showed that fat taxes hit low-income households the hardest (1).  They spend a larger portion of their income on food, so these taxes take a bigger bite out of their budgets. Remember the proposed soda tax in New York? It faced huge backlash because people recognized it would unfairly burden the poorest residents.  Simply redirecting the tax revenue to health programs doesn't solve the core problem \u2013 it\u2019s still taking more from those who can least afford it. We need solutions that promote healthy eating *without* punishing the poor.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s consider whether these taxes actually work.  Think about it \u2013 if the price of your favorite snack doubles, will you really stop eating it altogether?  You might buy less, sure, but you might also just switch to a slightly cheaper, equally unhealthy option. Or maybe you cut back on something else entirely, like fresh fruits and vegetables.  *Research backs this up.*  Several studies, including a comprehensive systematic review, have shown that people often find ways around these taxes (2, 3, 4). They substitute one unhealthy item for another, or they simply adjust their spending in other areas.  Remember the Danish saturated fat tax?  They tried it, and it barely made a dent in overall saturated fat intake. People just changed their shopping habits.  The tax was eventually repealed.  This shows us that simply taxing specific foods is unlikely to change overall consumption patterns.  While some suggest reinvesting the tax revenue, this avoids the real issue \u2013 people aren\u2019t necessarily eating healthier, and low-income families are still bearing the brunt of the cost.\n\nThird, let\u2019s look at the impact on businesses. Imagine you own a small grocery store.  Suddenly, demand for certain products drops because of a new tax.  That\u2019s lost revenue, and it can have a real impact on your livelihood.  A 2024 review in *Food Policy* analyzed 20 studies and found clear evidence of decreased sales and consumption of taxed foods, directly affecting industry revenues (5, 6).  The Danish fat tax, for example, led to more people crossing the border to shop and created huge administrative headaches for businesses.  It was repealed after just 15 months.  This illustrates the negative ripple effect these taxes can have.  While businesses might try to adapt by changing their products, that takes time and money, and it might not make up for the lost sales (7).  Plus, focusing on penalizing certain foods distracts us from the bigger picture \u2013 we need to educate people about healthy eating and make healthy options accessible to everyone.\n\nSo, let\u2019s recap.  Fat taxes disproportionately affect low-income families, they don\u2019t effectively reduce consumption, and they harm the food industry.  Instead of punishing people for their food choices, let\u2019s focus on real solutions.  We need to educate people about nutrition, improve access to healthy, affordable food, and encourage positive lifestyle changes.  Let\u2019s reject this fat tax and work together to build a healthier future for everyone.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are the supposed effectiveness of revenue redirection, the assumption of long-term behavior change, and the downplaying of the negative impact on businesses.\n\nFirst, the affirmative argues that a fat tax improves public health and that revenue generated can be used to fund health initiatives, mitigating the regressive impact on low-income families. However, even with revenue redirection, the initial increased cost of food burdens low-income households, restricting their choices and potentially leading to substitutions with cheaper, less healthy options. This financial strain disproportionately affects those already struggling to afford nutritious food, exacerbating existing health disparities. A study published in *The Lancet* (1) demonstrated that during the 2008 financial crisis, families facing economic hardship often substituted nutritious foods with less healthy alternatives due to price increases. This illustrates how a fat tax, even with revenue reallocation, can worsen dietary habits in vulnerable populations.\n\nSecond, the affirmative assumes that a fat tax encourages positive long-term shifts in consumer behavior.  However, this overlooks the fact that short-term reductions in the consumption of taxed items do not necessarily translate to sustained healthy habits.  The Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed just 15 months later (2), serves as a prime example. While initial sales of taxed items decreased, consumers often substituted them with equally unhealthy alternatives or crossed borders to purchase preferred foods.  This ultimately resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake and highlighted the ineffectiveness of the tax in achieving long-term dietary changes.  Therefore, simply taxing specific foods does not guarantee lasting improvements in dietary habits and may even lead to unintended consequences.\n\nThird, the affirmative minimizes the negative impact of a fat tax on businesses by suggesting that industry adaptation will mitigate these effects. This ignores the considerable costs and logistical challenges faced by businesses in reformulating products, as well as the potential job losses within affected industries.  A 2024 review in *Food Policy* (3) analyzed 20 studies and found that fat taxes consistently resulted in decreased sales of taxed products, impacting industry revenue. This economic burden can be significant, particularly for small businesses that operate on tighter margins and have less capacity to absorb such losses. The Danish fat tax, for instance, led to cross-border shopping and increased administrative burdens for businesses (4), ultimately contributing to its repeal.  The focus on penalizing specific foods, rather than promoting holistic health solutions, misdirects efforts and can have detrimental consequences for the food industry.\n\nReference:\n(1) \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n(2) The Conversation.

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue.

My latest publication is a commentary on the reversal of the Danish fat tax in New Scientist, November 26: Fighting the flab means fighting makers of fatty foods A YEAR ago in these pages, I congratulated the Danish government on its revolutionary experiment. It had just implemented a world-first fiscal and public health measure \u2013 a tax on food products containing more than 2.3 per cent saturated fat. This experiment has now been dropped. Under intense pressure from the food industry in an already weak economy, the Danish government has repealed the fat tax and abandoned an impending tax on sugars. Nobody likes taxes, and the fat tax was especially unpopular among Danish consumers, who resented having to pay more for butter, dairy products and meats \u2013 foods naturally high in fat. But the real reason for the repeal was to appease business interests. The ministry of taxation\u2019s rationale was that the levy on fatty foods raised the costs of doing business, put Danish jobs at risk and drove customers to buy food in Sweden and Germany. In June this year, a coalition of Danish food businesses organised a national repeal-the-tax campaign. The coalition said that fat and sugar taxes would cause the loss of 1300 jobs, generate high administrative costs and increase cross-border shopping \u2013 precisely the arguments cited by the government for its U-turn. We can now ask the obvious questions. Did the tax achieve its aims? Was it good public policy? What should governments be doing to reduce dietary risk factors for obesity? The purpose of food taxes is to reduce sales of the products concerned. In bringing in its fat tax, the Danish government also wanted to raise revenue, reduce costs associated with obesity-related diseases, and increase health and longevity. A year is hardly time to assess the impact on health, but the tax did bring in $216 million. Danes will now face higher income taxes to make up for the loss of the fat tax.

A 2024 review in *Food Policy* analyzed 20 studies on HFSS food taxes, finding evidence of decreased sales and intake, especially when combined with healthy food subsidies.  Higher tax rates were more effective, and subsidies helped offset regressive impacts on low-income groups.  While the Danish fat tax failed, its design flaws, including a low tax rate, narrow focus on saturated fat, and lack of accompanying measures, contributed to its ineffectiveness.  This doesn't negate the potential for well-designed fat taxes to achieve long-term dietary changes, as demonstrated by the broader evidence base.  The Danish case highlights the need for comprehensive tax design, not the inherent flaw of fat taxes.",

My latest publication is a commentary on the reversal of the Danish fat tax in New Scientist, November 26: Fighting the flab means fighting makers of fatty foods A YEAR ago in these pages, I congratulated the Danish government on its revolutionary experiment. It had just implemented a world-first fiscal and public health measure \u2013 a tax on food products containing more than 2.3 per cent saturated fat. This experiment has now been dropped. Under intense pressure from the food industry in an already weak economy, the Danish government has repealed the fat tax and abandoned an impending tax on sugars. Nobody likes taxes, and the fat tax was especially unpopular among Danish consumers, who resented having to pay more for butter, dairy products and meats \u2013 foods naturally high in fat. But the real reason for the repeal was to appease business interests. The ministry of taxation\u2019s rationale was that the levy on fatty foods raised the costs of doing business, put Danish jobs at risk and drove customers to buy food in Sweden and Germany. In June this year, a coalition of Danish food businesses organised a national repeal-the-tax campaign. The coalition said that fat and sugar taxes would cause the loss of 1300 jobs, generate high administrative costs and increase cross-border shopping \u2013 precisely the arguments cited by the government for its U-turn. We can now ask the obvious questions. Did the tax achieve its aims? Was it good public policy? What should governments be doing to reduce dietary risk factors for obesity? The purpose of food taxes is to reduce sales of the products concerned. In bringing in its fat tax, the Danish government also wanted to raise revenue, reduce costs associated with obesity-related diseases, and increase health and longevity. A year is hardly time to assess the impact on health, but the tax did bring in $216 million. Danes will now face higher income taxes to make up for the loss of the fat tax. Business groups insist that the t",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

(2015), as cited in the Institute of Economic Affairs publication (IEA, 2018), confirms the regressive impact of fat taxes, particularly on the elderly and low-income individuals in the US.  This is because these groups spend a larger proportion of their income on food, regardless of nutritional value.  The Lancet (2009) acknowledges this regressive nature, highlighting that low-income households spend a higher proportion of their income on the tax. While some argue that revenue redirection can mitigate this, the initial price increase still restricts food choices for low-income families, potentially leading to less healthy substitutions. This reinforces the argument that fat taxes disproportionately burden those least able to afford them.",

One such strategy is the imposition of taxes on foods and beverages high in sugar, salt, and fat. These taxes aim to reduce consumption of unhealthy products, improve public health, and generate revenue for health-related initiatives. This article delves into the effects of these taxes, examining their impact on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and economic factors. Understanding the Rationale Behind Food Taxes Before exploring the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes, it is essential to understand why these measures are considered. The primary reasons for implementing such taxes include: Effects on Consumer Behavior One of the immediate effects of imposing taxes on unhealthy food items is a change in consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to a decrease in the purchase and consumption of taxed products. For example: However, the effectiveness of these taxes in changing long-term behavior remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Impact on Health Outcomes The ultimate goal of sugar, salt, and fat taxes is to improve public health by reducing the incidence of diet-related diseases. While it is challenging to directly link these taxes to health outcomes due to the multifactorial nature of diseases, some studies suggest potential benefits: Nevertheless, the full health effects may only become apparent after several years or even decades. Economic Considerations Beyond health, sugar, salt, and fat taxes also have economic implications: It is crucial to balance the potential economic drawbacks with the long-term savings in healthcare costs due to improved public health.

Furthermore, these taxes disproportionately burden low-income households, leading to the purchase of cheaper, less healthy alternatives.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive.

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

The Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed in 2013, exemplifies this.  Initial decreases in sales of taxed items were offset by substitutions with equally unhealthy alternatives or cross-border purchases. This resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake, highlighting the ineffectiveness of the tax in achieving long-term dietary changes. Conversely, a study in *BMC Public Health* on promoting meal planning through mass media demonstrated positive changes in attitudes and behaviors related to healthy eating.  This suggests that education campaigns, by fostering awareness and empowering informed choices, offer a more sustainable and equitable path to improved public health outcomes compared to taxation.",

Abstract Objective: To evaluate awareness of the Eat Well Campaign (EWC) among parents and assess perceptions about its effectiveness. Design: Post-campaign evaluation study with a cross-section of parents recruited through random digit dialling. Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy). Setting: A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013\u20132014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents. Participants: Parents (n 964) of children aged 2\u201312 years from all Provinces and Territories. Results: Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0\u00b705). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1\u00b768, 95 % CI 1\u00b703, 2\u00b774) and planning meals (OR = 1\u00b766, 95 % CI 1\u00b703, 2\u00b754), b",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

A 2012 study in *The Lancet* examined the tax's effects and found that while initial sales of taxed items decreased, consumers adapted by substituting with equally unhealthy alternatives or crossing borders to purchase preferred foods. This resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake, demonstrating the tax's ineffectiveness in achieving long-term dietary changes.  Furthermore, a 2024 review in *Food Policy* highlighted the regressive nature of fat taxes, noting that low-income groups were more responsive to price changes and often substituted taxed items with cheaper, less healthy options. This substitution effect, coupled with the administrative burden on businesses and increased cross-border shopping, contributed to the tax's repeal and underscores its potential to worsen dietary habits, particularly among vulnerable populations. While revenue redirection may be intended to mitigate some negative impacts, the Danish case demonstrates that it doesn't fully address the core issue of substitution and may not prevent the exacerbation of health disparities.",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

My latest publication is a commentary on the reversal of the Danish fat tax in New Scientist, November 26: Fighting the flab means fighting makers of fatty foods A YEAR ago in these pages, I congratulated the Danish government on its revolutionary experiment. It had just implemented a world-first fiscal and public health measure \u2013 a tax on food products containing more than 2.3 per cent saturated fat. This experiment has now been dropped. Under intense pressure from the food industry in an already weak economy, the Danish government has repealed the fat tax and abandoned an impending tax on sugars. Nobody likes taxes, and the fat tax was especially unpopular among Danish consumers, who resented having to pay more for butter, dairy products and meats \u2013 foods naturally high in fat. But the real reason for the repeal was to appease business interests. The ministry of taxation\u2019s rationale was that the levy on fatty foods raised the costs of doing business, put Danish jobs at risk and drove customers to buy food in Sweden and Germany. In June this year, a coalition of Danish food businesses organised a national repeal-the-tax campaign. The coalition said that fat and sugar taxes would cause the loss of 1300 jobs, generate high administrative costs and increase cross-border shopping \u2013 precisely the arguments cited by the government for its U-turn. We can now ask the obvious questions. Did the tax achieve its aims? Was it good public policy? What should governments be doing to reduce dietary risk factors for obesity? The purpose of food taxes is to reduce sales of the products concerned. In bringing in its fat tax, the Danish government also wanted to raise revenue, reduce costs associated with obesity-related diseases, and increase health and longevity. A year is hardly time to assess the impact on health, but the tax did bring in $216 million. Danes will now face higher income taxes to make up for the loss of the fat tax. Business groups insist that the t",

Higher tax rates were more effective, and subsidies helped offset regressive impacts on low-income groups.  While the Danish fat tax failed, its design flaws, including a low tax rate, narrow focus on saturated fat, and lack of accompanying measures, contributed to its ineffectiveness.  This doesn't negate the potential for well-designed fat taxes to achieve long-term dietary changes, as demonstrated by the broader evidence base.

My latest publication is a commentary on the reversal of the Danish fat tax in New Scientist, November 26: Fighting the flab means fighting makers of fatty foods A YEAR ago in these pages, I congratulated the Danish government on its revolutionary experiment. It had just implemented a world-first fiscal and public health measure \u2013 a tax on food products containing more than 2.3 per cent saturated fat. This experiment has now been dropped. Under intense pressure from the food industry in an already weak economy, the Danish government has repealed the fat tax and abandoned an impending tax on sugars. Nobody likes taxes, and the fat tax was especially unpopular among Danish consumers, who resented having to pay more for butter, dairy products and meats \u2013 foods naturally high in fat. But the real reason for the repeal was to appease business interests. The ministry of taxation\u2019s rationale was that the levy on fatty foods raised the costs of doing business, put Danish jobs at risk and drove customers to buy food in Sweden and Germany. In June this year, a coalition of Danish food businesses organised a national repeal-the-tax campaign. The coalition said that fat and sugar taxes would cause the loss of 1300 jobs, generate high administrative costs and increase cross-border shopping \u2013 precisely the arguments cited by the government for its U-turn. We can now ask the obvious questions. Did the tax achieve its aims? Was it good public policy? What should governments be doing to reduce dietary risk factors for obesity? The purpose of food taxes is to reduce sales of the products concerned. In bringing in its fat tax, the Danish government also wanted to raise revenue, reduce costs associated with obesity-related diseases, and increase health and longevity. A year is hardly time to assess the impact on health, but the tax did bring in $216 million. Danes will now face higher income taxes to make up for the loss of the fat tax. Business groups insist that the t",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Objective: The aim of this review was to examine the contribution of food prices and diet cost to socioeconomic inequalities in diet quality. Data Sources: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases was performed. Study Selection: Publications linking food prices, dietary quality, and socioeconomic status were selected. Data Extraction: Where possible, review conclusions were illustrated using a French national database of commonly consumed foods and their mean retail prices. Data Synthesis: Foods of lower nutritional value and lower-quality diets generally cost less per calorie and tended to be selected by groups of lower socioec",

(2015), as cited in the Institute of Economic Affairs publication (IEA, 2018), confirms the regressive impact of fat taxes, particularly on the elderly and low-income individuals in the US.  This is because these groups spend a larger proportion of their income on food, regardless of nutritional value.  The Lancet (2009) acknowledges this regressive nature, highlighting that low-income households spend a higher proportion of their income on the tax. While some argue that revenue redirection can mitigate this, the initial price increase still restricts food choices for low-income families, potentially leading to less healthy substitutions. This reinforces the argument that fat taxes disproportionately burden those least able to afford them.",

Objective: The aim of this review was to examine the contribution of food prices and diet cost to socioeconomic inequalities in diet quality. Data Sources: A systematic literature search of the PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science databases was performed. Study Selection: Publications linking food prices, dietary quality, and socioeconomic status were selected. Data Extraction: Where possible, review conclusions were illustrated using a French national database of commonly consumed foods and their mean retail prices. Data Synthesis: Foods of lower nutritional value and lower-quality diets generally cost less per calorie and tended to be selected by groups of lower socioec",

One such strategy is the imposition of taxes on foods and beverages high in sugar, salt, and fat. These taxes aim to reduce consumption of unhealthy products, improve public health, and generate revenue for health-related initiatives. This article delves into the effects of these taxes, examining their impact on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and economic factors. Understanding the Rationale Behind Food Taxes Before exploring the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes, it is essential to understand why these measures are considered. The primary reasons for implementing such taxes include: Effects on Consumer Behavior One of the immediate effects of imposing taxes on unhealthy food items is a change in consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to a decrease in the purchase and consumption of taxed products. For example: However, the effectiveness of these taxes in changing long-term behavior remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Impact on Health Outcomes The ultimate goal of sugar, salt, and fat taxes is to improve public health by reducing the incidence of diet-related diseases. While it is challenging to directly link these taxes to health outcomes due to the multifactorial nature of diseases, some studies suggest potential benefits: Nevertheless, the full health effects may only become apparent after several years or even decades. Economic Considerations Beyond health, sugar, salt, and fat taxes also have economic implications: It is crucial to balance the potential economic drawbacks with the long-term savings in healthcare costs due to improved public health.

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

Abstract Objective: To evaluate awareness of the Eat Well Campaign (EWC) among parents and assess perceptions about its effectiveness. Design: Post-campaign evaluation study with a cross-section of parents recruited through random digit dialling. Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy). Setting: A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013\u20132014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents. Participants: Parents (n 964) of children aged 2\u201312 years from all Provinces and Territories. Results: Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0\u00b705). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1\u00b768, 95 % CI 1\u00b703, 2\u00b774) and planning meals (OR = 1\u00b766, 95 % CI 1\u00b703, 2\u00b754), b",

The Danish fat tax saw initial decreases but consumers substituted with equally unhealthy alternatives or crossed borders, resulting in minimal overall impact. Moreover, the increased cost burdens low-income households, potentially leading to worse dietary choices due to substitutions with cheaper, less healthy options.  This ultimately exacerbates existing health disparities, not improves them.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: Short-term reductions in the consumption of taxed items do not necessarily translate to sustained healthy habits.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_43', 'query': 'Long-term effects of fat taxes on public health', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '1_14', 'query': 'Studies on fat taxes and their impact on public health', 'title': 'Review: Effectiveness and policy implications of health taxes on foods high in fat, salt, and sugar', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306919224000101'}, {'id': '3_30', 'query': 'Fat tax Denmark cross border shopping', 'title': \"The Proof of the Pudding: Denmark's fat tax fiasco\", 'url': 'https://iea.org.uk/publications/research/the-proof-of-the-pudding-denmark\u2019s-fat-tax-fiasco'}, {'id': '3_32', 'query': 'Fat tax Denmark cross border shopping', 'title': 'The Danish fat tax: reflections on its demise.', 'url': 'https://www.foodpolitics.com/2012/11/the-danish-fat-tax-reflections-on-its-demise/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: While the Danish fat tax failed to achieve long-term dietary changes due to substitution and cross-border shopping, this case highlights the importance of comprehensive tax design, not the inherent flaw of fat taxes.  Evidence suggests that higher tax rates, combined with subsidies for healthy foods, can offset regressive impacts and drive sustained reductions in unhealthy food intake.  The Danish case underscores the need for complementary policies and robust enforcement, not the abandonment of fat taxes altogether.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: Fat taxes are regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income individuals.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_5', 'query': 'Regressive nature of fat taxes', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://iea.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/CC63_Sin-taxes_web.pdf'}, {'id': '0_6', 'query': 'Regressive nature of fat taxes', 'title': '\"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet', 'url': 'https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext'}, {'id': '0_9', 'query': 'Regressive nature of fat taxes', 'title': 'Evidence shows a fat tax would hit poorest the hardest', 'url': 'https://iea.org.uk/in-the-media/press-release/evidence-shows-a-fat-tax-would-hit-poorest-the-hardest'}, {'id': '0_10', 'query': 'Studies on socioeconomic disparities and fat taxes', 'title': 'Contribution of food prices and diet cost to socioeconomic disparities ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4586446/'}]\n\n**Long Argument**: Chouinard et al. (2015), as cited in the Institute of Economic Affairs publication (IEA, 2018), confirms the regressive impact of fat taxes, particularly on the elderly and low-income individuals in the US.  This is because these groups spend a larger proportion of their income on food, regardless of nutritional value.  The Lancet (2009) acknowledges this regressive nature, highlighting that low-income households spend a higher proportion of their income on the tax. While some argue that revenue redirection can mitigate this, the initial price increase still restricts food choices for low-income families, potentially leading to less healthy substitutions. This reinforces the argument that fat taxes disproportionately burden those least able to afford them.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Education and awareness campaigns are more effective than taxation in promoting healthy eating.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_16', 'query': 'Examples of fat taxes and their outcomes', 'title': 'Taxation of the fat content of foods for reducing their consumption and ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9508786/'}, {'id': '4_17', 'query': 'Effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing obesity', 'title': 'Taxation of the fat content of foods for reducing their consumption and ...', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32914461/'}, {'id': '5_36', 'query': 'Real world examples of fat taxes failing to achieve public health goals', 'title': 'Evidence shows a fat tax would hit poorest the hardest', 'url': 'https://iea.org.uk/in-the-media/press-release/evidence-shows-a-fat-tax-would-hit-poorest-the-hardest'}, {'id': '6_0', 'query': 'Effectiveness of education and awareness campaigns on healthy eating', 'title': 'Promoting meal planning through mass media: awareness of a nutrition ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10260515/'}]\n**Long Argument**: A 2020 review in *Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews* assessing the effects of fat taxes found limited evidence of long-term impact on total fat or saturated fat intake, body weight, or obesity. The Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed in 2013, exemplifies this.  Initial decreases in sales of taxed items were offset by substitutions with equally unhealthy alternatives or cross-border purchases. This resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake, highlighting the ineffectiveness of the tax in achieving long-term dietary changes. Conversely, a study in *BMC Public Health* on promoting meal planning through mass media demonstrated positive changes in attitudes and behaviors related to healthy eating.  This suggests that education campaigns, by fostering awareness and empowering informed choices, offer a more sustainable and equitable path to improved public health outcomes compared to taxation.\n\n\nOnly provide the generated statement without anything else. \n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, neighbors, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects us all: our health.  My opponents raise some concerns about a fat tax, and I want to address them head-on.\n\nFirst, they worry about the impact on vulnerable populations. They argue that increasing food costs will force lower-income families to choose cheaper, less healthy options.  Think about your own grocery bill lately \u2013 we all feel the pinch.  But here's the key: *this tax isn't about taking money away; it's about redirecting it*.  Imagine the revenue generated being used to make healthy foods more affordable for everyone.  That's like a discount at the grocery store, specifically for fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This not only eases the burden on families but also encourages healthier eating habits.  It's a win-win.\n\nSecond, they bring up the Danish fat tax, claiming it didn't work. They say people just bought unhealthy foods elsewhere or switched to different, equally unhealthy options.  But let's be clear: the Danish tax was flawed. It was a small tax, applied inconsistently, and didn't offer healthier alternatives.  It's like trying to fix a leaky roof with a band-aid.  A well-designed fat tax, with a broader scope and paired with incentives for healthy choices, is more likely to create lasting change.  The Danish example isn't a failure of the concept; it's a lesson in *how to do it right*.\n\nThird, they express concern about the impact on businesses. They talk about reformulation costs and potential job losses.  But businesses adapt all the time.  Think about how companies have innovated to meet changing consumer demands in the past. A fat tax would encourage the food industry to develop and market healthier products, creating new opportunities for growth.  Plus, the revenue generated could help businesses transition to healthier product lines, protecting jobs and fostering innovation.  This isn't about punishing businesses; it's about *working together* to create a healthier marketplace.\n\nFourth, they argue that focusing on specific foods is a misdirection of efforts. They again point to the Danish example, highlighting unintended consequences like cross-border shopping.  While the Danish tax had shortcomings, this doesn't negate the potential benefits of a well-designed tax.  Focusing on foods high in sugar, fat, and salt \u2013 the ones linked to chronic diseases \u2013 allows for targeted interventions.  Think about it: if we can reduce consumption of these specific foods, we can make a real difference in public health.  The Danish experience teaches us to be mindful of unintended consequences and design policies that minimize them.  It doesn't invalidate the strategy of using taxation to influence consumer behavior and improve public health.\n\nFinally, let's address the concern about the regressive nature of fat taxes. The goal isn't to punish low-income individuals.  The aim is to incentivize healthier choices and generate revenue for programs that benefit everyone.  This includes subsidizing healthy food options, funding educational campaigns, and supporting community health initiatives.  Studies by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA, 2018) and The Lancet (2009) highlight the importance of addressing the regressive nature of fat taxes.  These studies don't negate the potential public health benefits; they emphasize the need for careful policy design and targeted interventions to mitigate the impact on low-income households.  Education and awareness campaigns can also play a crucial role in promoting healthy eating habits.  By empowering individuals with knowledge and resources, we can create a more equitable and sustainable approach to improving public health.

        "statements": "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the effectiveness and fairness of a fat tax.\n\nWhile the proposition emphasizes the potential public health benefits and revenue generation, they fail to address the fundamental flaws in this approach.  Their argument hinges on the idea that revenue redirection will mitigate the regressive impact on low-income families. However, this ignores the immediate burden of increased food prices.  Imagine a single mother already struggling to feed her children.  A fat tax, even with eventual subsidies, means she has to choose between less food or less nutritious food *today*.  This immediate impact, before any long-term benefits materialize, exacerbates existing inequalities and undermines the very goal of promoting public health.  Even with subsidies, access to healthy options remains unequal due to factors like food deserts and ingrained cultural preferences.\n\nFurthermore, the proposition\u2019s reliance on the idea that a fat tax encourages long-term behavior change is unsupported by evidence.  The Danish fat tax, a real-world example, demonstrates that consumers often substitute taxed items with equally unhealthy alternatives or simply adjust their spending elsewhere.  This highlights the complexity of behavior change, where price is just one factor among many.  Simply making unhealthy foods more expensive doesn\u2019t magically transform eating habits.  True change requires a holistic approach that empowers individuals through education, access to healthy options, and support for positive lifestyle choices.\n\nFinally, we must consider the value of individual autonomy.  A fat tax, in essence, dictates what people can and cannot eat, infringing on their freedom of choice.  Instead of punishing people for their food choices, we should focus on empowering them with the knowledge and resources they need to make informed decisions.  This respects individual liberty and fosters a more sustainable approach to public health.\n\nReferences:\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Three specific types of taxes are studied in the literature: food group taxes; nutrient taxes; and nutrient index taxes. Anumber of studies use food expenditure data to assess the impact of various taxes on obesity and therefore only indirectly measure the impacts of taxes and subsidies on obesity. These studies generally conclude that food group taxes, nutrient taxes and nutrient index taxes have a small impact on the purchases of food and the nutrients purchased. Other studies use the body mass index as the explanatory variable and thus measure the impacts of taxes on body mass index directly. Nutrient taxes are found to be more effective than food group taxes, although even for nutrient taxes, the effects are small. In general, thin subsidies seem to offer more effective control of obesity than obesity taxes. However, due to the small effects of both fat taxes and thin subsidies, they are not recommended as instruments of food and nutrition policy.

The aim of this study is to estimate the impact of specific dietary taxes and subsidies on CMD deaths and disparities in the US. Methods Using nationally representative data, we used a comparative risk assessment to model the potential effects on total CMD deaths and disparities of price subsidies (10%, 30%) on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and nuts/seeds and taxes (10%, 30%) on processed meat, unprocessed red meats, and sugar-sweetened beverages. We modeled two gradients of price-responsiveness by education, an indicator of socioeconomic status (SES), based on global price elasticities (18% greater price-responsiveness in low vs. high SES) and recent national experiences with taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (65% greater price-responsiveness in low vs. high SES). Results Each price intervention would reduce CMD deaths. Overall, the largest proportional reductions were seen in stroke, followed by diabetes and coronary heart disease. Jointly altering prices of all seven dietary factors (10% each, with 18% greater price-responsiveness by SES) would prevent 23,174 (95% UI 22,024\u201324,595) CMD deaths/year, corresponding to 3.1% (95% UI 2.9\u20133.4) of CMD deaths among Americans with a lower than high school education, 3.6% (95% UI 3.3\u20133.8) among high school graduates/some college, and 2.9% (95% UI 2.7\u20133.5) among college graduates. Applying a 30% price change and larger price-responsiveness (65%) in low SES, the corresponding reductions were 10.9% (95% UI 9.2\u201310.8), 9.8% (95% UI 9.1\u201310.4), and 6.7% (95% UI 6.2\u20137.6).

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet.

While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Upon the examination of the available evidence as to the effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing obesity authors conclude that all types of fat taxes are not sufficiently specific in targeting obesity. In some cases imposition of fat tax may actually lead to reversal of the intended effect. Therefore, the use of taxes to reduce obesity and promote healthy outcomes is not recommended.

The rise in obesity forced governments to take certain actions economically, but the effectiveness of the same is studied through this research paper. The data has been collected from reputed news websites and journals. Denmark and Hungary have other schemes to tackle obesity, other than the fat tax; therefore the abolishing of the same was insignificant. Kerala did not learn from the mistakes of the countries and implemented it. We study the effect of the tax on the countries and state and the citizens.

The poll was undertaken in May 2024 and those surveyed were also asked to confirm their voting intention between Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat. 59% of those surveyed supported the view that a tax should be levied on companies producing food high in sugar and salt, with some of the resulting tax revenues to be used to fund fresh fruit and vegetables for low-income families. That percentage rose to 70% of the Labour voters surveyed compared to 54% of Conservative voters and 63% of Liberal Democrat voters. In a similar question, 53% of those surveyed supported the introduction of a tax on ultra-high processed food, again on the basis a proportion of the tax receipts were used to fund fresh fruit and vegetables for low-income families.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Ellingvag/Dagens Naringsliv/Corbis via Getty Images A regressive tax is one that\u00a0imposes a harsher burden on lower-income households than on households with higher incomes. In lower-income families, a larger proportion of their income pays\u00a0for shelter, food, and transportation. Any tax decreases their ability to afford these basics. Regardless of your income level, it is important to understand how these taxes affect your income so that you can make more informed decisions regarding your financial circumstances\u2014such as when you are voting on new tax laws, making purchases, or creating a budget. Key Takeaways What Is a Regressive Tax? Higher-income families, on the other hand, have no problem affording the basics.\u00a0Taxes can decrease their ability to invest in\u00a0stocks, add to retirement savings, or purchase luxury items. They may affect their standard of living but won't deprive them of living essentials. The\u00a0Bureau of Labor Statistics annual Consumer Expenditure Survey found that\u00a0the lowest-earning fifth of the population spent an average of $28,724 in 2020. Of that, they spent $12,317 on housing, $4,099 on food, and $4,363 on transportation. They only spent $610 on retirement savings and personal insurance. The highest-earning fifth spent $114,840 that year. Of that, they spent $36,645 on housing, $12,245 on food, and $16,796 on transportation. They spent $19,952 on retirement savings and insurance. The following chart illustrates the typical spending statistics by quintiles (fifths) of the population. Types of Regressive Taxes A regressive tax takes a higher proportion of earnings\u00a0from lower-income households than those with higher incomes. This is because they are taxed the same when consuming as higher earners\u2014$100 when shopping is worth more to a lower-tiered earner than it is to a higher-tiered earner, so taxes take more from them.

Its opposite, a progressive tax, imposes a larger burden on the wealthy. A change to any tax code that renders it less progressive is also referred to as regressive. If regressivity is part of a proposed tax, it can often become the focus of a political argument against that tax, even if regressivity is a by-product rather than the intention of the tax. Consequently, the chief examples of specific regressive taxes are those on goods whose consumption society wishes to discourage, such as tobacco, gasoline, and alcohol. These are often called \u201csin taxes.\u201d Most economists agree that the regressivity or progressivity of any specific tax is of minor economic importance. What matters is the degree of progressivity of the tax system as a whole. This is why even economists who advocate a steeply progressive overall tax system might support a tax on gasoline as a way of reducing air pollution; if the gasoline tax is an efficient way of reducing air pollution, its modest contribution to overall regressivity can be easily offset by more progressive wage or income taxes. However, any regressivity stemming from broad-based consumption taxes\u2014such as a general sales tax or a value-added tax\u2014can be hard to offset if a government raises a large proportion of its total revenues through these taxes. Consumption taxes are generally considered to be regressive because studies have shown that wealthier people spend a smaller proportion of their incomes. (A full analysis, however, must take into account any future consumption taxes that will ultimately be paid when the savings of the rich are eventually consumed.) To mitigate this perceived regressivity, consumption taxes are often levied at lower rates on goods perceived as necessities (such as food and clothing), while higher rates are levied on goods perceived as luxuries (such as jewelry and yachts).

Low-income taxpayers pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden, while middle- and high-income taxpayers shoulder a relatively small tax burden. What Are Some Examples of a Regressive Tax? The burden of a tax results from both the design of a tax and the true economic burden of a tax. A regressive tax is often flat in nature, meaning that the same rate of tax applies (generally) regardless of income. These taxes include most sales taxes, payroll taxes, excise taxes, and property taxes. Because the same rate of tax applies regardless of one\u2019s income, a lower-income individual may face a higher tax burden than a higher-income individual with the same amount of consumption. For example, if two individuals who make $20,000 and $40,000 spend $100 on clothing with a 5 percent sales tax rate, the lower-earner will be paying more taxes as a share of their income than the higher-earner. The same can be true of two neighbors with similar property values and property tax burdens. They will pay the same level of property taxes regardless of their income. How Regressive Are Excise Taxes and Tariffs? Excise taxes are particularly regressive. Households in the lowest one-fifth by income faced an average federal excise tax rate that is nine times greater than the average excise tax rate faced by the top 1 percent of households. The distributional effects of a tariff (the economic burden it places on households across income levels) tend to be regressive, burdening lower-income households more than higher-income households. Tariffs ultimately fall on the factors of production and reduce taxpayer labor and capital income. This occurs either by raising prices or reducing wage and capital income. Ana",

In a regressive tax system, the tax rate reduces as the taxpayer's income increases. For example, a sales tax on basic necessities such as food and clothing is an example of a regressive tax system. Low-income households allocate a greater proportion of their income towards necessities than high-income households, which leads to them paying a higher percentage of their income in sales taxes. In contrast, a progressive tax system increases the tax rate as the taxpayer's income increases. High-income households pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than low-income households. For example, a graduated income tax is an example of a progressive tax system. Impact of Regressive Tax System on Low-Income Households The impact of a regressive tax system on low-income households is significant. A regressive tax system places a greater burden on low-income households, who are already struggling to make ends meet. Low-income households allocate a larger proportion of their income toward fundamental needs, such as food, housing, and healthcare. Therefore, a tax on necessities such as food and clothing would significantly impact low-income households. Furthermore, a regressive tax system can exacerbate income inequality. When low-income households pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than high-income households, the gap between the rich and the poor widens. This widening gap can have a negative impact on social and economic stability. Examples of Regressive Tax Policies and Their Impact A sales tax is one of the most common examples of a regressive tax policy. Sales taxes are usually flat taxes that apply to all purchases, regardless of the buyer's income level.

Advertisement Food and health The Danish tax on saturated fat: why it did not survive European Journal of Clinical Nutrition volume\u00c2\u00a069,\u00c2\u00a0pages 223\u00e2\u20ac\u201c226 (2015)Cite this article 6622 Accesses 61 Citations 115 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Abstract Background/Objectives: Health promoters have repeatedly proposed using economic policy tools, taxes and subsidies, as a means of changing consumer behaviour. As the first country in the world, Denmark introduced a tax on saturated fat in 2011. It was repealed in 2012. In this paper, we present arguments and themes involved in the debates surrounding the introduction and the repeal. Subjects/Methods: An analysis of parliamentary debates, expert reports and media coverage; key informant interviews; and a review of studies about the effects of the tax on consumer behaviour. Results: A tax on saturated fat had been suggested by two expert committees and was introduced with a majority in parliament, as a part of a larger economic reform package. Many actors, including representatives from the food industry and nutrition researchers, opposed the tax both before and after its introduction, claiming that it harmed the economy and had no positive influence on health, rather the contrary. Few policy actors defended the tax. Public health had a prominent role in the politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arguments for introducing the tax but was barely mentioned in the debate about the repeal. Shortly after the repeal of the tax, research was published showing that consumption of saturated fat had declined in Denmark. Conclusions: The analysis indicates that the Danish tax on fat was introduced mainly to increase public revenue. As the tax had no strong proponents and man",

The model is used to simulate the impacts of a policy, in which a tax based on saturated fat content is combined with subsidy on fruit and vegetables. Changes in consumption are used to compute the effects on the risks of a range of diet-related disease using measures of relative risk.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: A Policy Failure Liam Sigaud* Since 2014, eight U.S. cities have implemented sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes. Several other cities and states are contemplating similar measures. SSB taxes are intended to curb sugar consumption and improve public health, but policymakers too often ignore the unintended consequences these measures provoke. This ConsumerGram examines the effects of SSB taxes, including their disproportionate impact on poor households, their failure to meaningfully shift consumers behaviors, and their negative economic effects on local communities. Introduction The debate that Americans, as a whole, consume too much sugar has received much attention recently.1 Research shows that diets high in added sugar contribute to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other chronic conditions.2 To address these public health concerns, some policymakers have embraced targeted \u201csin\u201d taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). In 2014, Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction in the nation to pass an SSB tax.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Existing evidence concerning their effects comes largely from simulation studies and trials in closed settings, both of which have limitations. Rigorous evaluation of actual taxes may provide richer evidence with greater external validity to support policy making. This article describes existing evaluation studies and outlines an implicit underlying theoretical framework for how taxes are expected to affect health. It then explores three important issues for future studies: selection of an appropriate evaluative perspective (comparing realist and biomedical experimental paradigms); approaches to causal inference; and the challenge of a low signal-to-noise ratio. We argue that evaluation should be informed by a realist perspective as well as making appropriate use of established empirical quasi-experimental approaches to testing causal effects. This should be underpinned by a theoretical framework that acknowledges complexity and the potential diversity of impacts.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive.

As the first country in the world, Denmark introduced a tax on saturated fat in 2011. It was repealed in 2012. In this paper, we present arguments and themes involved in the debates surrounding the introduction and the repeal. Subjects/Methods: An analysis of parliamentary debates, expert reports and media coverage; key informant interviews; and a review of studies about the effects of the tax on consumer behaviour. Results: A tax on saturated fat had been suggested by two expert committees and was introduced with a majority in parliament, as a part of a larger economic reform package. Many actors, including representatives from the food industry and nutrition researchers, opposed the tax both before and after its introduction, claiming that it harmed the economy and had no positive influence on health, rather the contrary. Few policy actors defended the tax. Public health had a prominent role in the politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arguments for introducing the tax but was barely mentioned in the debate about the repeal. Shortly after the repeal of the tax, research was published showing that consumption of saturated fat had declined in Denmark. Conclusions: The analysis indicates that the Danish tax on fat was introduced mainly to increase public revenue. As the tax had no strong proponents and man",

One such strategy is the imposition of taxes on foods and beverages high in sugar, salt, and fat. These taxes aim to reduce consumption of unhealthy products, improve public health, and generate revenue for health-related initiatives. This article delves into the effects of these taxes, examining their impact on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and economic factors. Understanding the Rationale Behind Food Taxes Before exploring the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes, it is essential to understand why these measures are considered. The primary reasons for implementing such taxes include: Effects on Consumer Behavior One of the immediate effects of imposing taxes on unhealthy food items is a change in consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to a decrease in the purchase and consumption of taxed products. For example: However, the effectiveness of these taxes in changing long-term behavior remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Impact on Health Outcomes The ultimate goal of sugar, salt, and fat taxes is to improve public health by reducing the incidence of diet-related diseases. While it is challenging to directly link these taxes to health outcomes due to the multifactorial nature of diseases, some studies suggest potential benefits: Nevertheless, the full health effects may only become apparent after several years or even decades. Economic Considerations Beyond health, sugar, salt, and fat taxes also have economic implications: It is crucial to balance the potential economic drawbacks with the long-term savings in healthcare costs due to improved public health.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive. This article delves into the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and the economy, supported by relevant examples, case studies, and statistics.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: A Policy Failure Liam Sigaud* Since 2014, eight U.S. cities have implemented sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes. Several other cities and states are contemplating similar measures. SSB taxes are intended to curb sugar consumption and improve public health, but policymakers too often ignore the unintended consequences these measures provoke. This ConsumerGram examines the effects of SSB taxes, including their disproportionate impact on poor households, their failure to meaningfully shift consumers behaviors, and their negative economic effects on local communities. Introduction The debate that Americans, as a whole, consume too much sugar has received much attention recently.1 Research shows that diets high in added sugar contribute to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other chronic conditions.2 To address these public health concerns, some policymakers have embraced targeted \u201csin\u201d taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). In 2014, Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction in the nation to pass an SSB tax. In the years since, several more U.S. cities -- including Seattle, Philadelphia, and San 1 Miller, Paige E., Robin A. McKinnon, Susan M. Krebs-Smith, Amy F.

A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet.

Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

Abstract In 2011, Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat, but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses, casting doubt on evidence, diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented, the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However, other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals, politicians and the public. In the end, the fat tax was abolished for financial reaso",

For instance, Denmark\u2019s fat tax, introduced in 2011, charged approximately $0.25 per kilogram of saturated fat, although it was short-lived due to public backlash and economic challenges.

Three specific types of taxes are studied in the literature: food group taxes; nutrient taxes; and nutrient index taxes. A number of studies use food expenditure data to assess the impact of various taxes on obesity and therefore only indirectly measure the impacts of taxes and subsidies on obesity. These studies generally conclude that food group taxes, nutrient taxes and nutrient index taxes have a small impact on the purchases of food and the nutrients purchased. Other studies use the body mass index as the explanatory variable and thus measure the impacts of taxes on body mass index directly. Nutrient taxes are found to be more effective than food group taxes, although even for nutrient taxes, the effects are small. In general, thin subsidies seem to offer more effective control of obesity than obesity taxes. However, due to the small effects of both fat taxes and thin subsidies, they are not recommended as instruments of food and nutrition policy.

As the first country in the world, Denmark introduced a tax on saturated fat in 2011. It was repealed in 2012. In this paper, we present arguments and themes involved in the debates surrounding the introduction and the repeal. Subjects/Methods: An analysis of parliamentary debates, expert reports and media coverage; key informant interviews; and a review of studies about the effects of the tax on consumer behaviour. Results: A tax on saturated fat had been suggested by two expert committees and was introduced with a majority in parliament, as a part of a larger economic reform package. Many actors, including representatives from the food industry and nutrition researchers, opposed the tax both before and after its introduction, claiming that it harmed the economy and had no positive influence on health, rather the contrary. Few policy actors defended the tax. Public health had a prominent role in the politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arguments for introducing the tax but was barely mentioned in the debate about the repeal. Shortly after the repeal of the tax, research was published showing that consumption of saturated fat had declined in Denmark. Conclusions: The analysis indicates that the Danish tax on fat was introduced mainly to increase public revenue. As the tax had no strong proponents and man",

While much remains unresolved, the available evidence does not favor subsidies on fresh fruit and vegetables or taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) as obesity policy. Taxes on specific nutrients are generally found to be more effective in reducing calorie consumption and body weight as well as economically more efficient. However, any food tax will be regressive and could have other undesirable unintended consequences, and it is not clear that it would be politically feasible to set any such tax at a high enough rate to have a worthwhile effect on reducing obesity.

Indeed, the established theory and evidence on the economics of the \u201cfixed charge\u201d (Alchian and Allen 1964; Barzel 1976) suggests that the opposite effect is likely: imposition of a fixed per unit cost (as with a per unit tax) reduces the relative price of higher quality and tends to induce quality upgrading. SSBs are disfavored in a number of countries, meaning that they are taxed at a higher rate than general foods and beverages. Countries that have implemented such a policy include Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, and the United Kingdom (Jou and Techakehakij 2012). For these countries, the VAT on SSBs ranges between 19% and 30%. Thow et al. (2011) s",

Abstract Several countries have introduced public health product taxes with the objective of reducing the absolute amount of consumption of unhealthy food and tackling obesity. This study aims to estimate the long-term impact of the Hungarian public health product tax introduced in 2011. To achieve this, a unique consumer purchase dataset was analysed to examine daily fast-moving consumer goods purchases from a representative sample of 2,000 households from 2010 to 2018. The results indicate that the tax has been fully reflected in consumer prices. A decline in consumption was observed initially, consistent with previous experiences in Hungary and other countries. However, over time, the data suggests a recovery and even an increase in line with the growth of disposable income. The proportion of taxed products in total fast-moving consumer goods purchases increased from 5.9 % (95 % CI: 5.7 % to 6.0 %) in 2010 to 7.4 % (95 % CI: 7.3 % to 7.6 %)",

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

One such strategy is the imposition of taxes on foods and beverages high in sugar, salt, and fat. These taxes aim to reduce consumption of unhealthy products, improve public health, and generate revenue for health-related initiatives. This article delves into the effects of these taxes, examining their impact on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and economic factors.

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Denmark is abandoning its effort to engineer a slimmer people while filling government coffers: It\u2019s the end for their fat tax on foodstuffs exceeding 2.3% saturated fat content, imposed only last year. So what went wrong? Little that wasn\u2019t predicted and predictable: The tax drove people to cheaper, lower quality, occasionally less fatty alternatives. And it drove Danes, quite literally, across the border to nearby Germany or Sweden to get their favorite foods. Danish television meanwhile scored high with a cooking show that extolled the virtues of butter. But do-gooder politicians have yet to repeal any tax just because it is not working, or impeding the daily lives of citizens. The fat tax was instead fried by Danish farmers complaining of the high administrative cost of fat-tax compliance, and losing business to foreign competitors who were running away with the bacon and the kringles. A planned Danish sugar tax has, for the same reasons, been shelved for now. Even then, no tax will just disappear: Danish politicians plan on filling the $200 million revenue gap left by the fat tax by raising the income tax. That\u2019s richer than those tax-threatened cheeses, since the fat tax came in addition to other taxes, without offsets. Yet the new income tax hike is marketed as offsetting lost revenue! That confirms this tax scheme was never more than a tax-hike masquerading as a public health measure. Health benefits for Danes, only 13% of whom count as obese, seem dubious, and none are being claimed..\u00a0 It\u2019s true that picking customer\u2019s wallets at food-store checkouts can alter behavior, but hardly in the desired direction.

But there isn\u2019t clear evidence on the effectiveness of so called \u201cfat taxes\u201d on changing consumption behavior. New research by Kanishka Misra of the University of Michigan\u2019s Ross School of Business shows how a fat tax could work, and help consumers to make healthier consumption decisions. He and co-authors Romana Khan of \u00d6zyegin University in Turkey and Vishal Singh of New York University accomplished this by analyzing milk purchases. Their study, \u201cWill a Fat Tax Work?,\u201d was published in the journal Marketing Science.Their results show that for a fat tax to nudge consumers to make healthier choices, they have to see the actual price difference on the shelf. The way milk is priced and produced allowed the researchers to see this behavior at work. \u201cWe find that it\u2019s really important for consumers to see the price difference right on the shelf, as opposed to a tax that\u2019s tacked on at the checkout scanner. And we saw this in data from milk purchases, because of the unusual way it\u2019s priced,\u201d said Misra, assistant professor of marketing and the Sanford Robertson Assistant Professor of Business Administration. Due to the way milk is processed, the more the fat content in milk, the higher the cost. Therefore, whole is the most expensive, followed by 2 percent, 1 percent, and fat-free is the least expensive. In some states, retailers follow this pricing structure, where whole milk is on average 5 percent more expensive than 2 percent milk (variable pricing), and in other states, all varieties are the same price (flat pricing). Importantly, they found no demographic differences between stores with the two different pricing schemes. That gave the researchers a natural quasi-experiment. Studying six years of milk purchase data, they noticed that stores with variable pricing have lower whole milk share and higher 2 percent milk shares when compared to stores with ",

Here Suzie Ferrie explains why a fat tax isn\u2019t enough to deal with the problem while Kathryn Backholer and Anna Peeters look at the relationship between socioeconomic status and weight. We often hear calls for a junk food tax or \u201cfat tax\u201d when there\u2019s discussion of Australia\u2019s growing obesity problem. The idea behind such a tax is that it would enable governments to subsidise healthy foods so that they\u2019re more affordable, and make unhealthy foods comparatively expensive so people buy less of them. But would they really? Is cost really the most powerful determinant of what food products people buy? Let\u2019s consider the likely effects of a junk food tax. Researchers claim that a 20% tax on a can of soft drink would be a sufficient deterrent to purchasing it. It\u2019s easy to visualise this: someone approaches the refrigerator in a convenience store wanting to buy a drink and ready to make a decision based on taste and cost. If a soft drink is more expensive than low-fat milk or water, it becomes less attractive and we could see a change in buying behaviour \u2013 and the attendant reduction in the consumption of obesity-promoting products. But the junk food tax idea falls over in other situations where food choices are made \u2013 when factors other than price come into play. Family dinner options, for instance, are rarely arrayed together in one location for a simple price comparison. In lower-in",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer, and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: - saturated (mostly from animal products, such as meat, cow's milk, cheese, cream, and butter); and - unsaturated (mostly found in oils from plants and fish). Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: - reduce the overall amount of fat they eat; - limit the amount of saturated fats they eat; and - eat unsaturated fats instead of saturated fats. Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue. We wanted to know whether increasing the prices of foods that have a lot of fats or saturated fats could put people off eating them, and reduce obesity. What did we do? We searched for studies that looked at the effects of a tax on the fat content of foods. We were interested in how a tax affected the: - total amount of fat, and saturated fats eaten; - total calories eaten; - calories eaten from all fats and saturated fats; and - rates of overweight and obesity.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Powell, Institute for Health Research and Policy and Department of Economics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 West Roosevelt, Room 558, Chicago, IL 60608 (email: powelll@uic.edu). Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

What is obesity? Body mass index (BMI) is usually a useful measure to show whether people are a healthy weight for their height. A BMI of 18 to 25 shows a healthy weight, a BMI over 25 is considered overweight, and a BMI over 30 shows obesity. Obesity is generally caused by consuming more energy (calories) than you burn off through physical activity or exercise. The body stores the excess energy as fat. Obesity can lead to serious and life-threatening conditions, including type 2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, some types of cancer (such as breast cancer and bowel cancer), and stroke. Obesity can also affect people's quality of life (well-being). What are fats? Fat is essential to a healthy, balanced diet. Fats help the body to absorb some vitamins, and are a source of some fatty acids that the body cannot make. The main types of fat in foods are: Health guidelines usually recommend that people should: Why we did this Cochrane Review Rates of overweight and obesity are increasing around the world and are a major public health issue.

Ideally, this should be combined with subsidies on healthy foods such as fruit and vegetables, they add. Their views come ahead of the 65th World Health Assembly taking place in Geneva on 21-26 May 2012 where prevention and control of non-communicable diseases will be a key issue for discussion. As an increasing number of countries introduce taxes on unhealthy food and drinks, Oliver Mytton and colleagues at the University of Oxford examine the evidence on the health effects of food taxes. Evidence suggests that taxing a wide range of unhealthy foods or nutrients is likely to result in greater health benefits than narrow taxes, they say, although the strongest evidence base is for tax on sugary drinks. For example, a US study found a 35% tax on sugar sweetened drinks ($0.45 (\u00a30.28; \u20ac0.34) per drink) in a canteen led to a 26% decline in sales. Meanwhile modelling studies predict a 20% tax on sugary drinks in the US would reduce obesity levels by 3.5%, and suggest that extending VAT (at 17.5%) to unhealthy foods in the UK could cut up to 2700 heart disease deaths a year. Opinion polls from the US also put support for tax on sugary drinks at between 37% and 72%, particularly when the health benefits of the tax are emphasised. However, they point out that understanding the overall effect on health is complicated, and that policy makers need to be wary of negative effects, like changes in other important nutrients and compensatory behaviour that may increase energy intake or reduce energy expenditure.

Related Follow @TIMEHealth To gain control of expanding waistlines worldwide, unhealthy foods and drinks need a 20% fat tax, along with subsidies for healthy food, experts say in a new paper published online in the British Medical Journal. Oliver Mytton, of the British Heart Foundation\u2019s Health Promotion Research Group, and his colleagues at the University of Oxford conducted a review of about 30 international studies to determine the effect that food taxes \u2014 which\u00a0are levied at a higher rate on food items considered unhealthy \u2014\u00a0have on public health. The team concluded that fat taxes can improve outcomes \u2014 but only if they put a significant dent in consumers\u2018 wallets. \u201cEconomists generally agree that government intervention, including taxation, is justified when the market fails to provide the optimum amount of a good for society\u2019s well-being,\u201d writes Mytton. \u201c[This] include[s] a failure to appreciate the true association between diet and disease, time inconsistency (preference for short-term gratification over long-term well-being), and not bearing the full health and social costs of consumption.\u201d (MORE:\u00a0Fat Forecast: 42% of Americans Could Be Obese by 2030) More and more countries are adopting\u00a0fat taxes in an effort to curb rising obesity rates. Both\u00a0Denmark and Hungary have introduced a fat tax or junk food tax, and France is taxing sweetened drinks. These taxes on sugary beverages have the strongest association with health benefits, according to the study.

Rapid Response: Re: Are taxes on fatty foods having their desired effects on health? Professor Winkler and Caillavet & Darmon, raise important issues related to the demise of the Danish fat tax. Professor Winkler calls for more information on the political process surrounding the success or failure of nutrition policies and Caillavet & Darmon suggest regulation for low cost reformulated products as an alternative. Also Professor Winkler correctly states that Smed and Robertson did not mention the debate raging in 2012 concerning the repeal of the tax by Danish government as of January 2013. Until more in-depth investigations are published this commentary provides an anecdotal review of the process that appeared to be behind the decision to repeal of the tax and asks whether any lessons can be learned regarding future tax related nutrition policies. Although \u201cluxury\u201d food items such as chocolate, ice-cream etc., have been taxed for many years, it represented a remarkably shift when the previous Danish government in 2011 ruled that saturated fats were to be taxed. It appears to be the first time any European Government decided to tax saturated fat as a compound. In addition to this decision the present Government that took office in late 2011 decided to implement another \u201ccompound\u201d tax, namely on food containing sugar as from January 2013. As yet no systematic investigations have been published regarding the political process that unfolded before and after the repeal of the fat tax. During 2012 the existing fat tax and the planned sugar tax was more or less treated as one topic in the huge media debate that followed which makes a detailed analysis a complex task. However it seems that the role of consensus building between the affected stakeholders was important for the final outcome along with high profile media coverage.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Abstract In 2011, Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat, but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses, casting doubt on evidence, diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented, the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However, other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals, politicians and the public. In the end, the fat tax was abolished for financial reaso",

View all partners It\u2019s easy to assume that public health measures, such as taxing unhealthy foods, are most successful when they are based on the best available evidence. However, research suggests that evidence-based policy-making doesn\u2019t always dictate public response. Researchers have also noted tensions between different types of evidence when establishing the legitimacy of a policy. We study taxes placed on foods that are deemed unhealthy, and find scientific evidence has not dominated the debates over the legitimacy of these measures. Instead, a food tax\u2019s chances of survival are based on the ability of political interests to create a successful narrative surrounding the policy\u2019s purpose. We compare Denmark, which implemented and quickly repealed a tax on saturated fats in 2011-12, and Ireland, which implemented a sugar-sweetened beverage tax in 2018 that has remained in place.

Roland Fumasi, head of RaboResearch Food and Agribusiness North America, shared insights into these possible challenges and opportunities during a recent interview. \u201cThe most tangible and likely thing right now is some adjustment to tariffs,\u201d Fumasi explained. He highlighted the potential for increased trade tensions with China, as well as proposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada. According to Fumasi, tariffs and retaliatory tariffs could have a \u201ctriple negative\u201d effect on the agricultural sector. First, they could lead to inflation in farm inputs such as chemicals and durable goods. Second, they might drag down U.S. exports due to retaliatory measures. Finally, a stronger U.S. dollar could make American products less competitive in global markets. These issues could also spill over into consumer behavior. Fumasi noted that tariffs on imports like fresh produce could significantly raise prices, particularly for fruits and vegetables from Mexico and Canada. While higher-income households may weather these increases, lower-income families could struggle to afford nutritious food. \u201cConsumers who already have a hard time paying for healthy fruits and vegetables could find these items even less affordable,\u201d he said. However, Fumasi also pointed to potential benefits. He suggested that Trump\u2019s focus on reducing regulatory burdens and increasing U.S. energy production could help control inflation and lower production costs for farmers. These steps might provide some relief in an otherwise uncertain environment. Fumasi urged farmers to stay alert as the new administration\u2019s policies take shape. \u201cPay attention to how the details unfold\u2026 capture some profit when you can,\u201d he advised, emphasizing the need for flexibility in navigating potentia",

After winning his return bid on Tuesday, Trump\u2019s second term is likely to once again have a sizable impact on the nation\u2019s farms and ranches. Here are four ways Trump\u2019s next four years as president could impact the agriculture industry. Trump may reject sustainable food movement in response to climate change President Joe Biden\u2019s administration spent billions on agriculture practices meant to curtail greenhouse gas emissions, but some environmentalists worry Trump will reverse those investments.\u00a0 \u201cThere\u2019s a possibility that $19 billion of historic generational climate investments in agriculture could be completely lost,\u201d said Ranjani Prabhakar, the legislative director of healthy communities for Earthjustice, a nonprofit environmental law center.\u00a0 The nation\u2019s agriculture sector accounted for 10% of all greenhouse gas emissions in 2022, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency data. The agency cites cattle production, rice crops and the application of chemical fertilizers as major sources of climate pollution. During his first term, Trump reversed more than 100 climate and environmentally-focused rules that originated under former president Barack Obama\u2019s administration. Under Trump, the USDA also stopped publishing government studies that mentioned climate change, according to a 2019 Politico investigation. He also pulled the U.S. out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. Project 2025, the roadmap for a second term created by many Trump supporters and advisors, outlines that, under Trump, the USDA should remove the country from any \u201cschemes\u201d to produce sus",

The economic literature shows that the U.S. import tariffs and subsequent retaliatory tariffs imposed by China and other countries on U.S. agricultural exports have hurt the U.S. agricultural industry and could impact future production, further raising food prices. Tariffs generally raise consumer prices, and while that\u2019s true of export tariffs too, the mechanism operates a bit differently. Limitations on exports, whether through tariffs or explicit export bans, often produce an excess in goods. If firms are unable to sell their products to the world, they must sell more of them domestically. The surplus lowers prices in the short run. But when firms invest in producing food, a highly volatile commodity, they invest based on what return they think they will be likely to earn in the future. If their access to a foreign market is limited due to another country\u2019s tariffTariffs are taxes imposed by one country on goods imported from another country.

This paper is the first to propose ex ante evaluations of these policy options. To this end, we study the French market for fromages blanc and dessert yogurts, which is characterized by an exogenous variation in legal labeling requirements across products. This is used to identify separately the consumer preferences for fat-content labels and for fat in a structural demand model that is estimated from household scanner panel data. The estimated demand functions are then combined with a structural supply model to evaluate the impact of fat policies on several market outcomes. An ad-valorem tax of 10% on the producer price of full-fat products is shown to result in a 9% fall in fat purchases, whereas the mandatory labeling of fat content produces a 1.5% decrease only. This is explained by the producer price responses, which neutralize up to 96% of the impact of mandatory labeling on consumer demand. 2011 A number of public health advocates and consumer associations urge policy makers to strengthen nutrient labelling rules, in order to help people to make healthier and better informed food choices. Yet, little is known about the e\u00a4ectiveness of mandatory labelling.

Abstract In 2011, Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat, but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses, casting doubt on evidence, diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented, the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However, other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals, politicians and the public. In the end, the fat tax was abolished for financial reaso",

Then it proceeds to look at the negative impact of illicit trade: income for organized crime, insurgents and terrorists, loss of income for legitimate actors, human deaths and human health, the economic cost of human health, the growth of \u201ccriminal-support ecosystems,\u201d environmental destruction, worker\u2019s rights, bad governance, and the sustenance of rogue regimes. In short, the conclusion of the aforementioned negative effects is that illicit trade hampers human development \u2013 clearly undermining the Sustainable Development Goals. A short discussion on how illicit trade can be used as a strategic tool is also included. The low-profile and constantly ongoing nature of illicit trade is also compared to other more dramatic high-profile nature of other security challenges, which is given as a possible reason for the relatively low prioritization of some of its component problems. In terms of addressing the problem of illicit trade going forward three solutions are proposed: (1) collecting better data on illicit trade providing for better policy analysis, (2) \u201ccompleting globalization\u201d through enhancing counter illicit trade mechanisms in trade frameworks and developing new legal frameworks to address international cybercrime, and (3) more effective targeting of \u201cproblem states\u201d that are central for certain kinds of illicit trade by collective action of like-minded states opposed to illicit trade.

The Stratbase ADR Institute for Strategic and International Studies (ADRi) is an independent strategic research organization with the principal goal of addressing the issues affecting the Philippines and East Asia through: 1. Effecting national, regional and international policy change or support 2. Fostering strategic ideas based on cooperation and innovative thinking 3. Providing a regional venue for collaboration and cooperation in dealing with critical issues in East Asia; and 4. Actively participating in regional debates and global conversations With its international focus, ADRi believes that Philippine and regional security and development can be achieved through the cooperation of the public and private sectors. ADRi traces its roots to the Stratbase Research Institute (SRI) established in 2004. SRI focused on providing strategic solutions to domestic governance, socio-economic, and other policy concerns. It aimed to contribute to Philippine development through research and responsive policy alternatives. As SRI sought solutions, East Asia\u2019s affairs frequently inserted themselves into the equation.

Consequently, Jamaica is moving away from the largely unprocessed and minimally processed traditional Jamaican diet to the ultra-processed Standard American Diet (SAD), which is rich in refined carbohydrates, added sugars, trans fats, and saturated fats \u2014 all hallmarks of an unhealthy diet.\u00a0 While obesity is complex, an unhealthy diet is the number one risk factor for certain noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease. 54% of Jamaicans are either overweight or obese, while one in three have hypertension and one in eight have type 2 diabetes. Four out of five annual deaths are attributable to NCDs, and a 30-year-old has a 17% chance of dying prematurely from NCDs. The prevalence of NCDs threatens the nation\u2019s health and economic and sustainable development goals. Additionally, the impact of unhealthy diets on Jamaican children is particularly concerning as it can lead to the early onset of NCDs, weaken their immune systems, and contribute to behavioral issues \u2014 all of which can stunt their development.\u00a0 To combat this, Jamaica must leverage public health taxes \u2014 particularly on unhealthy foods and beverages, such as sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) \u2014 as one of the many interventions needed to address the growing NCD burden.\u00a0 Understanding Public Health Taxes: Case Studies Public health taxes are a type of excise tax imposed on products that negatively impact population health, such as tobacco, alcohol, and SSBs. The World Health Organization has recommended their implementation reduce the attractiveness of unhealthy foods and change obesogenic food environments. By increasing prices, these taxes aim to decrease the demand for unhealthy products. Additionally, the revenue generated can be directed toward health care initiatives and public health campaigns, further supporting the nation\u2019s health and dev",

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Abstract Background Fiscal policies to fight obesity such as taxation of unhealthy foods or sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) have gained considerable attention in recent years. Many studies modelling the impact of various magnitudes of taxes on SSB purchasing and their potential effects on various health outcomes have been published; however, legislation and implementation of such taxes have encountered many obstacles in the countries that have implemented them to date. We investigated the perceptions and views of key opinion leaders, policy makers and various other Israeli stakeholders on taxation of SSBs and unhealthy snacks. We also evaluated the challenges and barriers that may be expected for initiating such a policy. Methods A qualitative study based on 39 in-depth interviews with",

Contact Is the fat tax really effective? Recently, some European countries, including Spain, have considered introducing new taxes to reduce their budget deficits. Among the set of measures, they have proposed a fat tax, which has the aims of not only increasing revenues, but also reducing junk food consumption, and thereby obesity rates and the concomitant health costs. Although this is what we expect from the theory, empirical evidence is revelatory of a different picture. Firstly, the tax is not fully reflected in the prices of the products that have been targeted. In fact, in the countries where the tax has been imposed, supermarkets and other food stores have played with prices and margins of other products in an attempt to avoid raising the prices of the products that are subject to taxation. For example, some firms have increased the prices of substitutes (e.g. sodas with low calories) while spreading the higher cost of taxed food onto other foods or own-branded products that typically have higher profit margins. Another interesting reaction from the supply side has been that producers have been substituting those taxed products with un-taxed products that are just as unhealthy. Additionally, they have also reduced the amount of some inputs below the legal threshold to avoid the fat tax. Ostensibly, these tricks have clearly diminished the effectiveness of the tax. On the demand side, we have also seen interesting reactions. Firstly, it is important to notice that people who consume more junk food are less responsive to a price increase than moderate consumers. Hence, the fat tax is not actually benefiting its most important target audience. Furthermore, there is an important substitution effect as all products have, on the whole, become more expensive, consumers have switched",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

LaFaive, Todd Nesbit, Ph.D. and Scott Drenkard Contents Introduction Since 2008 the Mackinac Center for Public Policy \u2014 and more recently in conjunction with the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation \u2014 has worked to estimate the degree to which cigarettes are smuggled into and out of American states. Our research, and that of other scholars too, suggests that smuggling is a rampant problem, particularly in states with high cigarette excise taxes. Unintended and unforeseen consequences are a frequent problem in public policy. Few politicians realize when they vote for higher excise taxes that doing so may dramatically increase cigarette-related crime, such as smuggling. These crimes not only deprive local and state governments of tax revenues, they also tend to descend into violence, which produces all sorts of unnecessary damage. Policymakers should take these realities into consideration when contemplating how much to tax cigarettes. This report analyzes the relationship between cigarette tax rates and cigarette smuggling rates. It relies on the same statistical model used in our previous studies, but uses the latest available data from 2014. New York State once again claims the highest smuggling rate in the nation. In fact, according to our analysis, New Yorkers consume more smuggled cigarettes than they do legally taxed ones. New York state has the highest excise tax rate on cigarettes in the country at $4.35 per pack and New York City adds another $1.50 tax. Arizona, Washington state, New Mexico and Minnesota round out the top five states for percentage of in-bound smuggling. Michigan ranks 12th, down two positions. Massachusetts distinguished itself between our 2015 and 2016 analyses for its change in rank among smuggling states. It leapt 15 positions from 22nd in our rankings to 7th. Minnesota increased by 11 spots from 16th to 5th and we expect to see the North Star State continue to climb due to a state law that ties automatic cigarette tax inc",

In recent years, state governments have frequently turned to higher cigarette excise taxes as a means of both raising taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local, state, and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services, goods, and activities. revenues and enforcing a particular social policy through their tax codes. The escalation in state cigarette excise taxes, however, has not been uniform across the nation. While some states have raised their cigarette excise taxes by as much as 200 percent in recent years, others have not altered these taxes in nearly a quarter of a century. This has created a situation where a wide disparity exists among the states in both cigarette excise taxes and prices. One possible response to higher cigarette prices is to lower consumption .The compact, lightweight nature of cigarettes, however, makes it an ideal product for both casual cross-border purchases and large scale, interstate smuggling. Thus the disincentive to consume tobacco products posed by higher taxes can be largely mitigated by changes in purchasing patterns. The incentives to engage in either of these activities clearly increase as the tax differentials between states rise. This is not a new phenomenon. The avoidance of excise taxes has a long history both in the United States and the rest of the world. During the late 1960s and early 1970s differentials of a similar magnitude l",

This paper examines how a policy went from having almost unanimous parliamentary support to becoming \u2018an unbearable burden\u2019 on the Danish people.The economic effects of the fat tax were almost invariably negative. It was blamed for helping inflation rise to 4.7 per cent in a year in which real wages fell by 0.8 per cent. Many Danes switched to cheaper brands or went over the border to Sweden and Germany to do their shopping. At least ten per cent of fat tax revenues were swallowed up in administrative costs and it was estimated to have cost 1,300 Danish jobs.The fat tax had a very limited impact on the consumption of \u2018unhealthy\u2019 foods. One survey found that only seven per cent of the population reduced the amount of butter, cream and cheese they bought and another survey found that 80 per cent of Danes did not change their shopping habits at all.The fat tax was always controversial and it became increasingly unpopular as time went on. Objections came not just from business owners, but also from trade unions, politicians, journalists and the general public. It was widely criticised across the political spectrum for making the poor poorer. By October 2012, 70 per cent of Danes considered the tax to be \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018very bad\u2019 and newspapers routinely described it as \u2018infamous\u2019, \u2018maligned\u2019 and \u2018hated\u2019. Mette Gjerskov, the minister for food, agriculture and fisheries, admitted in late 2012: \u2018The fat tax is one of the most criticised policies we have had in a long time.\u2019Denmark\u2019s fat tax remains the leading example of an ambitious anti-o",

My latest publication is a commentary on the reversal of the Danish fat tax in New Scientist, November 26: Fighting the flab means fighting makers of fatty foods A YEAR ago in these pages, I congratulated the Danish government on its revolutionary experiment. It had just implemented a world-first fiscal and public health measure \u2013 a tax on food products containing more than 2.3 per cent saturated fat. This experiment has now been dropped. Under intense pressure from the food industry in an already weak economy, the Danish government has repealed the fat tax and abandoned an impending tax on sugars. Nobody likes taxes, and the fat tax was especially unpopular among Danish consumers, who resented having to pay more for butter, dairy products and meats \u2013 foods naturally high in fat. But the real reason for the repeal was to appease business interests. The ministry of taxation\u2019s rationale was that the levy on fatty foods raised the costs of doing business, put Danish jobs at risk and drove customers to buy food in Sweden and Germany. In June this year, a coalition of Danish food businesses organised a national repeal-the-tax campaign. The coalition said that fat and sugar taxes would cause the loss of 1300 jobs, generate high administrative costs and increase cross-border shopping \u2013 precisely the arguments cited by the government for its U-turn. We can now ask the obvious questions. Did the tax achieve its aims? Was it good public policy? What should governments be doing to reduce dietary risk factors for obesity? The purpose of food taxes is to reduce sales of the products concerned. In bringing in its fat tax, the Danish government also wanted to raise revenue, reduce costs associated with obesity-related diseases, and increase health and longevity. A year is hardly time to assess the impact on health, but the tax did bring in $216 million. Danes will now face higher income taxes to make up for the loss of the fat tax.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Taxing unhealthy foods like sugary drinks makes them relatively more expensive, potentially encouraging people to buy more healthy alternatives. Evidence shows that such taxes do reduce consumption and that firms reformulate their products, with beneficial effects on health. Taxes on sugary soft drinks have been implemented in many places. In the UK, the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (commonly known as the \u2018sugar tax\u2019), which was introduced in March 2018, adds a charge of between 18p and 24p per litre on drinks depending on the quantity of sugar that they contain. These types of taxes have been effective at reducing consumption of sugary soft drinks, and at encouraging firms to reformulate and reduce the amount of sugar in the drinks they produce. According to one study, the percentage of drinks with over five grams of sugar per 100 millilitres fell from an expected level of 49% to 15% between September 2015 and February 2019. This suggests that broader taxes that increase the prices of other types of unhealthy food could be effective tools for tackling obesity, although their ultimate success will depend on how consumers and firms respond to their introduction. Why tax some foods and not others? Governments commonly use taxes to make some goods more expensive than others to discourage people from purchasing them. These are called \u2018corrective taxes\u2019 because they aim to correct the fact that the market price of a product may not fully reflect all the costs associated with consumption, including any to wider society. These include the costs of trea",

Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 15 January 2018 Abstract The global burden of obesity leads to significant morbidity and has major economic implications. In April 2018, Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle this using fiscal measures when the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy is introduced. We review recent evidence from natural experiments of the impact of health-related food and drink taxes on consumer behaviour, and discuss the possible consequences of these approaches on purchases and health. We highlight some of the potential indirect consequences and the importance of robust prospective evaluation. Keywords In recent decades, the global burden of obesity and related conditions has surged. In 2014, 13\u00a0% of the world's population were obese(1), with an estimated cost to the global economy of $2 trillion(2). Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle the consequences of obesity using fiscal measures when the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) is introduced in April, 2018(3). Recent data on the impact of health-related food and drink taxes from natural experimental evaluations are allowing us to better understand how fiscal measures affect behaviour. In this review, we draw on this new evidence and discuss how health-related food and drink taxes might change purchasing habits and improve health. Why implement food and drink taxes?

By: Jacob Silverman The fat tax is a contentious topic, with some experts questioning whether it\u2019s a helpful way to fight obesity. See more diet fads pictures. Photographer: Lyn Baxter | Agency: \u00adIn the fight against obesity, suggestions to increase nutrition education, remove soft drinks from schools, change how companies can advertise, ban trans fats and subsidize healthy foods are all common. But there's one potential tool you may not have heard of, though it's been discussed for more than a decade. A June 2007 study suggests that a \"fat tax\" -- placing a tax on fatty or unhealthy foods -- might save thousands of lives and reduce health care costs. Also called the Twinkie tax, the fat tax concept was pioneered by Kelly D. Brownell, a professor of psychology at Yale University, who wrote about it in the New York Times in 1994. Dr. Brownell outlined two proposals, the first of which suggested a 7 percent to 10 percent tax on unhealthy foods. The tax revenue would then subsidize the sale of healthy foods. The tax would apply to broad types of foods or target certain fatty foods. Brownell's alternate proposal stated that a lesser tax could be used to fund public programs promoting healthy and responsible eating. Advertisement Researchers at Oxford University and Nottingham University claim that a 17.5 percent Value Added Tax (VAT) on unhealthy food could save up to 3,200 lives a year. The tax would effectively save lives by reducing demands for unhealthy foods, consequently reducing occurrences of serious complications from obesity, such as heart attacks and diabetes. In determining how demand would",

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

Advertisement Food and health The Danish tax on saturated fat: why it did not survive European Journal of Clinical Nutrition volume\u00c2\u00a069,\u00c2\u00a0pages 223\u00e2\u20ac\u201c226 (2015)Cite this article 6622 Accesses 61 Citations 115 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Abstract Background/Objectives: Health promoters have repeatedly proposed using economic policy tools, taxes and subsidies, as a means of changing consumer behaviour. As the first country in the world, Denmark introduced a tax on saturated fat in 2011. It was repealed in 2012. In this paper, we present arguments and themes involved in the debates surrounding the introduction and the repeal. Subjects/Methods: An analysis of parliamentary debates, expert reports and media coverage; key informant interviews; and a review of studies about the effects of the tax on consumer behaviour. Results: A tax on saturated fat had been suggested by two expert committees and was introduced with a majority in parliament, as a part of a larger economic reform package. Many actors, including representatives from the food industry and nutrition researchers, opposed the tax both before and after its introduction, claiming that it harmed the economy and had no positive influence on health, rather the contrary. Few policy actors defended the tax. Public health had a prominent role in the politicians\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 arguments for introducing the tax but was barely mentioned in the debate about the repeal. Shortly after the repeal of the tax, research was published showing that consumption of saturated fat had declined in Denmark. Conclusions: The analysis indicates that the Danish tax on fat was introduced mainly to increase public revenue. As the tax had no strong proponents and man",

One such strategy is the imposition of taxes on foods and beverages high in sugar, salt, and fat. These taxes aim to reduce consumption of unhealthy products, improve public health, and generate revenue for health-related initiatives. This article delves into the effects of these taxes, examining their impact on consumer behavior, health outcomes, and economic factors. Understanding the Rationale Behind Food Taxes Before exploring the effects of sugar, salt, and fat taxes, it is essential to understand why these measures are considered. The primary reasons for implementing such taxes include: Effects on Consumer Behavior One of the immediate effects of imposing taxes on unhealthy food items is a change in consumer behavior. Studies have shown that price increases can lead to a decrease in the purchase and consumption of taxed products. For example: However, the effectiveness of these taxes in changing long-term behavior remains a subject of ongoing research and debate. Impact on Health Outcomes The ultimate goal of sugar, salt, and fat taxes is to improve public health by reducing the incidence of diet-related diseases. While it is challenging to directly link these taxes to health outcomes due to the multifactorial nature of diseases, some studies suggest potential benefits: Nevertheless, the full health effects may only become apparent after several years or even decades. Economic Considerations Beyond health, sugar, salt, and fat taxes also have economic implications: It is crucial to balance the potential economic drawbacks with the long-term savings in healthcare costs due to improved public health.

Upon the examination of the available evidence as to the effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing obesity authors conclude that all types of fat taxes are not sufficiently specific in targeting obesity. In some cases imposition of fat tax may actually lead to reversal of the intended effect. Therefore, the use of taxes to reduce obesity and promote healthy outcomes is not recommended.

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive.

A fat tax aims to discourage unhealthy diets and offset the economic costs of obesity. A fat tax aims to decrease the consumption of foods that are linked to obesity. A related idea is to tax foods that are linked to increased risk of coronary heart disease. Numerous studies suggest that as the price of a food decreases, individuals get fatter.[2][3][4] In fact, eating behavior may be more responsive to price increases than to nutritional education.[5] Estimates suggest that a 1 cent per ounce tax on sugar-sweetened beverages may reduce the consumption of those beverages by 25%.[6] However, there is also evidence that obese individuals are less responsive to changes in the price of food than normal-weight individuals.[7] To implement a fat tax, it is necessary to specify which food and beverage products will be targeted. This must be done with care, because a carelessly chosen food tax can have surprising and perverse effects.[8] For instance, consumption patterns suggest that taxing saturated fat would induce consumers to increase their salt intake, thereby putting themselves at greater risk for cardiovascular death.[8] Current proposals frequently single out sugar-sweetened drinks as a target for taxation.[9][10] Cross-sectional, prospective, and experimental studies have found an association between obesity and the consumption of sugar-sweetened drinks.[11][12] However, experimental studies have not always found an association, and the size of the effect can be very modest.[13] Since the poor spend a greater proportion of their income on food, a fat tax might be regressive. Taxing foods that provide primarily calories, with little other nutritional value reduces this problem, since calories are readily available from many sources in diet of industrialized nations. To make a fat tax less burdensome for the poor, proponents recommend ear",

Contact Is the fat tax really effective? Recently, some European countries, including Spain, have considered introducing new taxes to reduce their budget deficits. Among the set of measures, they have proposed a fat tax, which has the aims of not only increasing revenues, but also reducing junk food consumption, and thereby obesity rates and the concomitant health costs. Although this is what we expect from the theory, empirical evidence is revelatory of a different picture. Firstly, the tax is not fully reflected in the prices of the products that have been targeted. In fact, in the countries where the tax has been imposed, supermarkets and other food stores have played with prices and margins of other products in an attempt to avoid raising the prices of the products that are subject to taxation. For example, some firms have increased the prices of substitutes (e.g. sodas with low calories) while spreading the higher cost of taxed food onto other foods or own-branded products that typically have higher profit margins. Another interesting reaction from the supply side has been that producers have been substituting those taxed products with un-taxed products that are just as unhealthy. Additionally, they have also reduced the amount of some inputs below the legal threshold to avoid the fat tax. Ostensibly, these tricks have clearly diminished the effectiveness of the tax. On the demand side, we have also seen interesting reactions. Firstly, it is important to notice that people who consume more junk food are less responsive to a price increase than moderate consumers. Hence, the fat tax is not actually benefiting its most important target audience. Furthermore, there is an important substitution effect as all products have, on the whole, become more expensive, consumers have switched",

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

Restaurant foods were not covered by the labeling requirement, but a more stringent \u201ctrans fat ban\u201d for restaurants (servings cannot exceed 0.5 grams) was passed later that year in New York City [2, 3]. Similar restaurant-specific \u201cbans\u201d have since been enacted in dozens of local and state jurisdictions [4, 5] but remain highly controversial. It is no surprise that policymakers have taken an increased interest in trans fat consumption. A large and growing medical literature links consumption of trans fats to cardiovascular disease [6]. According to the American Medical Association, replacing artificial trans fats with healthier oils could save 30,000 to 100,000 lives annually in the U.S. [7]. Should the government not try to reduce the amount of trans fat Americans consume to help improve the population\u2019s health and longevity? More generally, what role (if any) should public policy play in moving the population towards healthier diets?

Abstract Although obesity rates among US children have increased during the past 3 decades, effective public policies have been limited, and the quest for workable solutions raises ethical questions. To address these concerns, in 2010, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation convened an expert panel to consider approaches to the ethics problems related to interventions for childhood obesity. On the basis of recommendations from the expert panel, we propose frameworks for policy approaches and ethical aspects of interventions and evaluation. We present these frameworks in the context of other papers in this collection and make recommendations for public health practice. Introduction Childhood obesity in the United States presents major health challenges, but neither the medical industry, public health advocates, nor policy makers have identified effective ways of reversing increasing rates of obesity among youth. Policy debates often focus on low energy expenditure attributable to increasingly inactive lifestyles. However, efforts to increase physical activity among youth have limited benefits without simultaneous attention to decreasing caloric consumption.

As with most indirect taxes, they take a greater share of income from the poor than from the rich in all plausible scenarios. \u25cf \u25cf \u0007 Sin taxes are regressive if we look at income groups and are even more regressive if we look at individual consumers.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Received 2012 Nov 9; Accepted 2013 Feb 19; Issue date 2013 Jul. Abstract Personalized nutrition has the potential to enhance individual health control. It could be seen as a means to strengthen people\u2019s autonomy as they learn more about their personal health risks, and receive dietary advice accordingly. We examine in what sense personalized nutrition strengthens or weakens individual autonomy. The impact of personalized nutrition on autonomy is analyzed in relation to responsibility and trustworthiness. On a societal level, individualization of health promotion may be accompanied by the attribution of extended individual responsibility for one\u2019s health. This constitutes a dilemma of individualization, caused by a conflict between the right to individual freedom and societal interests. The extent to which personalized nutrition strengthens autonomy is consequently influenced by how responsibility for health is allocated to individuals. Ethically adequate allocation of responsibility should focus on prospective responsibility and be differentiated with regard to individual differences concerning the capacity of adults to take responsibility. The impact of personalized nutrition on autonomy also depends on its methodological design. Owing to the complexity of information received, personalized nutrition through genetic testing (PNTGT) is open to misinterpretation and may not facilitate informed c",

Understanding individual attitudes toward paternalism Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 14 December 2022 Abstract In the past decades, behavioral economics has credibly identified numerous decision-making biases leading people to make choices they would not have made if better informed about the long-term consequences of their actions. This has given rise to a new reason for government interventions: internalities. In contrast to traditional reasons for government intervention, such as redistribution and externalities, overcoming internalities often involves the use of paternalistic policies. We investigate theoretically and empirically the formation of attitudes toward paternalistic policies. Theoretically, we focus on the role of self-interest and distinguish between self-interest as construed for the rational decision-maker, self-interest when self-control problems are present, and self-interest when procedural or expressive elements, such as autonomy, matter. Empirically, we employ two novel data sets: a Danish survey on political opinion combined with administrative data on actual behavior and a large-scale cross-country survey to analyze attitudes toward paternalistic policies in the health and financial domains. We show that targets of paternalism are more opposed to paternalism than non-targets both in Denmark and across nine Western democracies and rely on our theoretical priors to explore mechanisms that can explain these attitudes.

Abstract Although inequality in the US has increased since the 1960s, several studies show that Americans underestimate it. Reasons include overreliance on one\u2019s local perspective and ideologically-motivated cognition. We propose a novel mechanism to account for the misperceptions of income inequality. We hypothesize that compared to those who feel less autonomy, the people who believe they are autonomous and have control over their lives also believe that (1) income inequality is lower and (2) income inequality is more acceptable. Using a representative sample of 3,427 Americans, we find evidence to support these hypotheses. Introduction In the American dream, freedom comes with opportunities for prosperity if people work hard, make sacrifices, and take risks. Success is not limited by social class. This ideal may explain Americans\u2019 tolerance for greater income inequality relative to the tolerance of citizens from other wealthy countries. How much income inequality is there in the US?

Please enable cookies to ensure you get the best experience on our website Sign the petition to call for a Convention of States! 10 terrifying examples of federal overreach Published in Blog on May 23, 2019 by Convention Of States Project The following was written by Utah Rep. Merrill Nelson and was originally published on DeseretNews.com. Most people would agree that the federal government has exceeded its constitutional bounds \u2014 that it is too big, too intrusive and too expensive. Congress functions as a national legislature, far beyond its \"few and defined\" powers, to encroach on those reserved to the states and the people. Examples include education, health care and various criminal laws. Even more intrusive, however, are the more than 400 federal agencies created by Congress that issue thousands of regulations controlling every aspect of our lives, from our air and water to our farms and factories. The executive branch now chooses which laws to enforce and issues its own laws through executive orders and administrative rules. And the federal courts now routinely decide matters of public policy historically reserved to the states, including life, marriage and morality. In short, we have lost the balance of federalism \u2014 that apportionment of powers between the federal and state governments so carefully crafted by our Founders. Our state laws contain over 500 references to controlling federal law. Federal agencies now overlap and control our state agencies with thousands of federal regulations. And how are we controlled? With the lure of federal dollars, which now comprise over 25 percent of our state budget. Utah, of course, is not unique. The carefully limited federal government created by the states now has an annual budget three times the size of all 50 states combined! Of course, most of that spending is based on debt that now exceeds $22 trillion. The federal government dominates the states with its laws, regulations, courts, agents and blandishments. ",

A report by the University of Nottingham and University of Oxford [1], claimed that introducing a tax on unhealthy foods would save, at least, 3,000 lives a year from heart disease. The authors also claim this is a conservative estimate, because it ignores the benefits from the reduced incidence of diabetes, strokes and other obesity related illnesses. Yet, despite the real benefits promised, many politicians and consumers were quick to dismiss the idea. Is it really a good idea to introduce a fat tax, or do Big Macs deserve to remain cheap and free of extra tax? Arguments for a Tax on Unhealthy Foods Externalities of Unhealthy Foods. Unhealthy eating has an impact on ourselves but also on the rest of society. Obesity related diseases cost the UK \u00a33.4bn per year. [2] The cost of Obesity in the US is estimated at $75 bn.[3] If we choose to eat foods that make us unhealthy and obese, this creates external costs such as: Medical Costs \u2013 treating obesity. Lost productivity at Work e.g. Time off sick Premature death Therefore, the government should collect sufficient tax from unhealthy foods to pay for the external costs that they create. It is the same principle as to why petrol and cigarettes are taxed; e.g. higher petrol tax is justified because petrol causes pollution. The external cost of unhealthy food is not easy to calculate, but this is not a reason to avoid having a tax. The point is that at the moment society is effectively subsidising the consumption of unhealthy foods, and ultimately it is the taxpayer who has to pay for this. Personal Cost of Obesity Eating unhealthy foods increases the likelihood of obesity, early death, depression and a whole catalogue of related problems [4]. Higher prices would discourage people from consuming unhealthy foods. It may not stop p",

Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out.

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1.

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options.

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

Supporters say the measure will stop 2 million kids from lighting up and spur about 1 million adults to quit, but the sharp hike has some smokers fuming. Cigarette taxes, detractors argue, are a way for governments to line their coffers by legislating personal choice--and a prime example of a regressive \"sin tax,\" the term often used for fees tacked on to popular vices like drinking, gambling and smoking. The sin tax is an established tactic. In the early 1500s, Pope Leo X underwrote his lavish lifestyle in part by taxing licensed prostitutes, and Peter the Great preyed on Russian vanity two centuries later by charging men who grew beards. In the Federalist papers, American patriot Alexander Hamilton proposed an excise tax on alcohol to boost revenues and curb consumption. The measure, enacted in 1791, sparked the Whiskey Rebellion, in which federal authorities were forced to quash an uprising by livid Pennsylvania settlers. The U.S. has taxed cigarettes since the Civil War, although its levies often lag behind those assessed by other nations. This month's increase--signed by a President who's trying to kick the habit himself--comes as recession-battered states are considering charges on everything from pornography to marijuana as a way to pad their budgets.

Giselleflissak / Getty Images What Is a Sin Tax? A sin tax is an excise tax on\u00a0specific goods and services due to their ability, or perception, to be harmful or costly to society. The tax comes at the time of purchase. Some items that often have a sin tax include tobacco products, alcohol, and gambling. Sin taxes seek to deter people from engaging in socially\u00a0harmful activities and behaviors. They also provide a\u00a0source of revenue for governments. Key Takeaways Understanding Sin Taxes Sin taxes are typically added to liquor, cigarettes, and goods that are considered morally hazardous. Because they generate enormous\u00a0revenue, state governments favor sin taxes. Society accepts sin taxes because they affect only those who use sin taxed products or engage in sin taxed behaviors. When individual states run a\u00a0deficit, a sin tax is generally one of the first taxes recommended by lawmakers to help fill the budget gap. A sin tax is a type of Pigovian tax, which is levied on companies that create negative externalities with their business practices. Pigovian taxes seek to lower or end the use of harmful products by making them more expensive to buy. Sin tax proponents maintain that the targeted behaviors and goods produce negative externalities. In other words, they foist an unfair burden on the rest of society. The effects of alcohol and tobacco products increase healthcare costs, driving up the cost of insurance for everyone. Also, compulsive gambling compromises the security and well-being of the home life, children, and families of the gambler. The sin taxes are designed to reduce those negative behaviors. In many cases, these taxes are effective, especially with younger consumers who have less disposable income and are still developing their habits and preferences. For example, taxes on cigarettes can decrease rates and smoking and improve public health outcomes. A 10% tax on ci",

It describes how sin taxes evolved from a politically- or religiously-motivated policy to the present-day conventional wisdom, which holds that sin taxes serve as economic penance for externality-generating choices and as a correction for cognitive biases. It illustrates how the conventional wisdom traces to the progressive era and its belief in the power of experts to diagnose and cure societal ills, especially those involving public health. The chapter contrasts that vision against criticism that paternalism overvalues experts\u2019 abilities and that, despite its success in politics, paternalism tends to fail in practice.

In some instances, sumptuary laws did not target intrinsically sinful choices but instead attempted to enforce a class system. For example, certain laws banned the poor from wearing types of clothing that were typically worn by the wealthy. Other laws, particularly during the reign of Edward I in England, sought to curb meat consumption. In 1216, he proclaimed that too many \u201cpersons of inferior rank\u201d imitated the \u201cgreat men\u201d of the time by eating an \u201coutrageous and excessive multitude of meats,\u201d which led to \u201cmany great evils.\u201d That the taxes were often levied on only a few items did not mean the burden was intended to fall on a small number of individuals.

Increasing a sin tax is often more popular than increasing other taxes. However, these taxes have often been criticized for burdening the poor and disproportionately taxing the physically and mentally dependent.[2] Summary The enactment of sin taxes on harmful activities varies by jurisdiction. In many cases, sumptuary taxes are implemented to mitigate use of alcohol and tobacco, gambling, and vehicles emitting excessive pollutants. Sumptuary tax on sugar and soft drinks has also been suggested.[3] Some jurisdictions have also levied taxes on recreational drugs such as cannabis where it has been legalized and regulated.[4] Revenue generated by sin taxes supports many projects imperative in accomplishing social and economic goals.[5] American cities and counties have utilized funds from sin taxes to expand infrastructure,[6] while in Sweden the tax for gambling is used for helping people with gambling problems. Public acceptance of sumptuary taxes may be greater than income tax or sales tax. Support Opposition See also References ",

Taxes on Sugar-Sweetened Beverages: A Policy Failure Liam Sigaud* Since 2014, eight U.S. cities have implemented sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes. Several other cities and states are contemplating similar measures. SSB taxes are intended to curb sugar consumption and improve public health, but policymakers too often ignore the unintended consequences these measures provoke. This ConsumerGram examines the effects of SSB taxes, including their disproportionate impact on poor households, their failure to meaningfully shift consumers behaviors, and their negative economic effects on local communities. Introduction The debate that Americans, as a whole, consume too much sugar has received much attention recently.1 Research shows that diets high in added sugar contribute to obesity, heart disease, diabetes, and a host of other chronic conditions.2 To address these public health concerns, some policymakers have embraced targeted \u201csin\u201d taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs). In 2014, Berkeley, California became the first jurisdiction in the nation to pass an SSB tax.

The Concept of Fat Tax The concept of a fat tax is rooted in the idea of using fiscal policy as a tool to promote healthier eating habits and reduce the consumption of foods that contribute to obesity. The rationale behind this approach is multifaceted, involving not only health considerations but also economic and social dimensions. From a public health perspective, the increasing prevalence of obesity worldwide presents a significant challenge, with numerous studies linking high body mass index (BMI) to a range of chronic diseases, including diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Economically, the costs associated with treating obesity-related conditions place a substantial burden on healthcare systems, prompting governments to explore innovative solutions to mitigate these expenses. From a social standpoint, the debate around fat taxes often centers on the balance between personal responsibility and the role of the state in safeguarding public health. Proponents argue that such taxes can act as a deterrent against unhealthy food choices, much like taxes on tobacco aim to reduce smoking rates. Critics, however, raise concerns about the regressive nature of fat taxes, which may disproportionately affect lower-income individuals who often have limited access to healthier food options. 1. Health Impact: A fat tax aims to decrease the intake of foods high in saturated fats, trans fats, and added sugars, which are known contributors to o",

Unfortunately, the lack of sound thinking behind vilifying sugary drinks or less healthful snacks has not changed, nor has the blunt, imprecise, and unfair nature of a \"junk food\" or sugary drink tax. No matter the good intentions, taxing certain foods to make us healthier remains bad public policy. There are several reasons why this is so, the most fundamental being that such taxes affect everyone regardless of their girth or lifestyle choices. Consider the case of a Canadian who runs three times a week, plays sports from time to time, eats a well-balanced diet, and is in excellent physical condition. If she likes to relax with a pop and watch a movie on the weekend, or enjoy a chocolate bar with lunch, why should she pay more to do so? Notably, in 2012, 52.5 per cent of Canadians aged 18 and older, and 21.8 per cent of Canadian youth (aged 12 to 17) reported themselves to be overweight or obese. In other words, flip those statistics over, and a sizable portion of the adult population and the majority of the youth population are neither overweight nor obese by body mass index (the common metric of overweight and obesity) standards. \"Junk food\" or sugary drink taxes not only fail to distinguish between overweight/obese Canadians and those who are not, but they are also a regressive form of taxation. A number of studies have found that diets of less healthy food options are less expensive than diets of healthier food options. Further, lower socioeconomic classes are typically more dependent on fast foods for their nourishment. Both suggest that a tax on less healthful/fattier food options will have a disproportionate effect on lower-income Canadians. \"Junk food\" taxes are also not guaranteed to reduce overall caloric intake, ",

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

She applies theories of rational and irrational consumer decision-making to obesity-related consumption decisions and presents a simple supply and demand model to suggest the likely consequences of a fat tax. The author concludes that, before implementing a fat tax, additional research is needed to determine if a fat tax is merely the latest fad or a significant policy initiative that will make real contributions to correcting a major health problem in the United States.

Such taxes are currently already in place in countries in Europe (e.g. Hungary, France and Finland) and in various states in the USA. Although these taxes are possibly efficient in reducing by a small amount the consumption of targeted products if the tax is fully transmitted to the consumer, there is too little available evidence on what will be consumed instead and whether these food substitutions undermine the hoped-for health benefits of the tax. We also know very little on how the food supply side will respond and what overall impact this will have. Without a proper appreciation of the potential indirect impacts we do not know the overall impact of taxes foods on unhealthy foods and beverages and further that there is a very real possibility that they may not be beneficial for health after all. Fighting the \u2018obesity\u2019 problem Obesity and the implications of high bodyweight are among the greatest challenges facing health systems worldwide. Governments are, quite rightly, desperately seeking effective policy tools to turn the tide before it becomes a tsunami.1\u20133 The list of policy options follows the well-worn staples of public health: front of pack labels to improve consumer information on foods, restricting marketing of unhealthy foods, promoting healthy foods and the selection of healthy diets, and subsidizing healthy foods and activities. Unfortunately so far, at a population level, these policies have not been effective at scale: overweight and obesity rates and as well as nutrition-related chronic disease rates continue to increase in countries irrespective of income level.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

They are not approaches that on their own are likely to bring about change. Policy evidence from existing food tax implementation suggest that taxes need to be paralleled by subsidies and other interventions to encourage healthy eating. Such dual methods help not only contribute to nutrition outcomes but also ensure political support for food taxes. Politicians and policy makers are suspicious of taxes, using subsidies and revenue monies from taxes to support healthy eating is more likely to encourage both political and public support. Building support for policies is never just a matter of academic evidence. Public health advocates need to show more ambition by developing skills in implementing pricing policies to support healthy eating. Key opponents to taxes are the food industry who use a range of arguments to prevent taxation being implemented. Public health advocates are weak in tackling the issues of corporate power and providing evidence to maintain policy and political support. The public health movement needs to continue to develop the political will among politicians and the public for taxes on food. A new way of looking at policy formation is required and this includes addressing the power of corporate interests ",

At the same time, these taxes raise revenue to offset the supposed public costs of the supposedly harmful products being taxed, or to fund other government programs. Today, public health advocates champion taxing sugary foods and drinks, like soda, as a way to fight obesity. While most U.S. states have food taxes that encompass products like soda, few\u2014apart from Berkeley, California\u2014have soda taxes specifically aimed at reducing obesity. Past efforts to implement these \u201cfat taxes\u201d have largely failed to gain support due to opposition from consumers, economists, and the industry,2 but the recent apparent \u201csuccess\u201d in Mexico, which enacted a soda tax in 2014, has reinvigorated efforts in the states.3 Most recently, Philadelphia is considering a 1.5 to 3 cent per ounce soda tax aimed at raising $400 million for a universal pre-K program and \u201cother\u201d programs.4 But do soda taxes work? Arguments for soda taxes rely on the assumption that a small price increase will encourage people to consume less soda, and that reduced soda consumption will lead to an overall reduction in calorie consumption and thus weight. This paper examines these assumptions and makes the case that soda taxes disproportionately affect the poorest members of society while failing to achieve both their stated public health and revenue goals. Do Soda Taxes Reduce Soda Consumption? Basic economic theory holds that as the price of a good increases, the demand ",

Abstract Objective To systematically review evidence from field interventions on the effectiveness of monetary subsidies in promoting healthier food purchases and consumption. Design Keyword and reference searches were conducted in five electronic databases: Cochrane Library, EconLit, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science. Studies were included based on the following criteria: (i) intervention: field experiments; (ii) population: adolescents 12\u201317 years old or adults 18 years and older; (iii) design: randomized controlled trials, cohort studies or pre\u2013post studies; (iv) subsidy: price discounts or vouchers for healthier foods; (v) outcome: food purchases or consumption; (vi) period: 1990\u20132012; and (vii) language: English. Twenty-four articles on twenty distinct experiments were included with study quality assessed using predefined methodological criteria. Setting Interventions were conducted in seven countries: the USA (n 14), Canada (n 1), France (n 1), Germany (n 1), Netherlands (n 1), South Africa (n 1) and the UK (n 1). Subsidies applied to different types of foods such as fruits, vegetables and low-fat snacks sold in supermarkets, cafeterias, vending machines, farmers\u2019 markets or restaurants.

                      "raw_content": "To fill budget gaps, several state legislatures have proposed increasing existing taxes on tobacco and alcohol products. In addition, some states (as well as the federal government) are considering the enactment of new \u201csin taxes,\u201d for example taxes on high-sugar drinks and internet pornography. This Article examines many of the traditional arguments for and against sin taxes. It then focuses on an argument that has previously received little attention\u2014the conflict of interest created by a state\u2019s dependence on sin tax revenues. When states become dependent on sin tax revenues to fund essential government services, they develop an interest in maintaining sales of the \u201csinful\u201d product. Consequently, the states\u2019 financial interest may conflict with the interest in protecting their citizens\u2019 health. The Article examines this conflict of interest in the context of the states\u2019 dependence on tobacco revenues. In particular, the Article explains how the $200 billion Master Settlement Agreement between the states and the major tobacco manufacturers aligns the states\u2019 and the tobacco companies\u2019 financial interests. The Article then considers two alternatives that may break, or at least mitigate, the alignment of interest between the states and the sellers of harmful, taxed products: earmarking and securitization. By earmarking or securitizing sin tax revenues, states decouple their financial interests from the interests of companies selling the \u201csinful\u201d product. The Article concludes that unless states take action to address the conflict of interest that arises as a result of their dependence on sin tax revenues, the states themselves may become the \u201csinners\u201d by sacrificing their citizens\u2019 health for much-needed revenue.

They\u2019re called sin taxes, and they drive up costs for consumers of goods deemed unhealthy, risky, or otherwise undesirable. While they aim to curb use, sin taxes stir up surprising debate. In this post, we\u2019ll uncover the backstory behind sin taxes, detail how they secretly impact your purchases, and explore the controversy around these sneaky surcharges. From early America to present day, views on so-called \u201csinful\u201d goods have always shaped sin tax policies and heated discourse. What consumes the most wallet share \u2013 the revenues from sin tax or public wellbeing? Do the ends justify the means? We\u2019ll break down need-to-know basics, global perspectives, future outlooks, and yes \u2013 effects on your own bottom line. By exposing financial arteries influenced by sin taxes, you can gain consumer powers that authorities prefer kept hush. What is the main purpose of a sin tax? Have you ever felt guilty ordering one too many drinks? Or maybe those cigarette cravings snuck up on you when you were already short on cash? Well my friend, you\u2019re not alone. So-called \u201csinful\u201d indulgences have been around for centuries. But the concept of a special tax on vices emerged surprisingly early in American history. In the beginning, sin taxes were embraced as an easy way to fund lofty political goals without ruffling too many feathers. Tobacco became one of the first targets in the 1790s, soon followed by alcohol taxes intended to finance the fledgling nation\u2019s Revolutionary War debts. And yes, some moral judgment was baked in from the start. But the main appeal was financial. Fast forward a few decades and the motivation shifted. Spurred by growing temperance movements, alcohol taxes began aiming to curb overconsumption rather than simply raise funds. And once smoking\u2019s dire health effects came to light in the 1960s, tobacco taxes followed a similar trajectory. Revenue generation remai",

Haile\u2217 To fill budget gaps, several state legislatures have proposed increasing existing taxes on tobacco and alcohol products. In addition, some states (as well as the federal government) are considering the enactment of new \u201csin taxes,\u201d for example taxes on high-sugar drinks and internet pornography. This Article examines many of the traditional arguments for and against sin taxes. It then focuses on an argument that has previously received little attention\u2014the conflict of interest created by a state\u2019s dependence on sin tax revenues. When states become dependent on sin tax revenues to fund essential government services, they develop an interest in maintaining sales of the \u201csinful\u201d product. Consequently, the states\u2019 financial interest may conflict with the interest in protecting their citizens\u2019 health. The Article examines this conflict of interest in the context of the states\u2019 dependence on tobacco revenues. In particular, the Article explains how the $200 billion Master Settlement Agreement between the states and the major tobacco manufacturers aligns the states\u2019 and the tobacco companies\u2019 financial interests. The Article then considers two alternatives that may break, or at least mitigate, the alignment of interest between the states and the sellers of harmful, taxed products: earmarking and securitization. By earmarking or securitizing sin tax revenues, states decouple their financial interests from the interests of companies selling the \u201csinful\u201d product. The Article concludes that unless states take action to address the conflict of interest that arises as a result of their dependence on sin tax revenues, the states themselves may become the \u201csinners\u201d by sacrificing their citizens\u2019 health for much-needed revenue.

The Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed in 2013, exemplifies this.  Initial decreases in sales of taxed items were offset by substitutions with equally unhealthy alternatives or cross-border purchases. This resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake, highlighting the ineffectiveness of the tax in achieving long-term dietary changes.

Abstract Objective: To evaluate awareness of the Eat Well Campaign (EWC) among parents and assess perceptions about its effectiveness. Design: Post-campaign evaluation study with a cross-section of parents recruited through random digit dialling. Participants completed an online survey about EWC awareness, its perceived effectiveness among parents and their meal planning practices (attitudes, behaviours and self-efficacy). Setting: A federal mass-media campaign disseminated by Health Canada (2013\u20132014) to promote meal planning to Canadian parents. Participants: Parents (n 964) of children aged 2\u201312 years from all Provinces and Territories. Results: Of respondents, 41 % (390/964) were aware of the campaign; Quebec City and rural Quebec had the highest rates of awareness, whereas Vancouver, Winnipeg and Toronto had the lowest. Awareness was greater among parents with lower income, basic education and French-speakers. Campaign intensity was significantly associated with greater odds of reporting positive attitudes towards the EWC and meal planning (P < 0\u00b705). Campaign awareness was significantly associated with greater odds of believing that meal planning helps maintain a healthy diet (OR = 1\u00b768, 95 % CI 1\u00b703, 2\u00b774) and planning meals (OR = 1\u00b766, 95 % CI 1\u00b703, 2\u00b754), b",

We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods.

Design: Data were cross-sectional and collected as part of the 2018 International Food Policy Study. Respondents were asked whether they had seen government healthy eating campaigns in the past year; if yes (awareness), they were asked to describe the campaign. Open-ended descriptions were coded to indicate recall of specific campaigns. Logistic models regressed awareness of healthy eating campaigns on participant country, age, sex, ethnicity, education, income adequacy and BMI. Analyses were also stratified by country. Setting: Online surveys. Participants: Participants were Nielsen panelists aged \u226518 years in Australia, Canada, Mexico, UK and the USA (n 22 463). Results: Odds of campaign awareness were higher in Mexico (50\u00b79 %) than UK (18\u00b72 %), Australia (17\u00b79 %), the USA (13\u00b70 %) and Canada (10\u00b72 %) (P < 0\u00b7001). Awareness was also higher in UK and Australia v. Canada and the USA, and the USA v. Canada (P < 0\u00b7001). Overall, awareness was higher among males v. females and respondents with medium or high v. low education (P < 0\u00b7001 for all).

Different food environment policies can influence food availability, affordability, and marketing, all of which shape food choice and dietary quality. This chapter describes how optimal food environments can support healthy diets and nutrition. Select policy areas that influence diets and nutrition are discussed, including food marketing and advertising, market-based subsidies and taxes, labeling, food-based dietary guidelines and mass media campaigns, consumer awareness and nutrition education, and nudge and choice architecture. The application of policy action within physical spaces and places is also described. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

Published online by Cambridge University Press:\u00a0 15 January 2018 Abstract The global burden of obesity leads to significant morbidity and has major economic implications. In April 2018, Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle this using fiscal measures when the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy is introduced. We review recent evidence from natural experiments of the impact of health-related food and drink taxes on consumer behaviour, and discuss the possible consequences of these approaches on purchases and health. We highlight some of the potential indirect consequences and the importance of robust prospective evaluation. Keywords In recent decades, the global burden of obesity and related conditions has surged. In 2014, 13\u00a0% of the world's population were obese(1), with an estimated cost to the global economy of $2 trillion(2). Britain will join a growing number of countries attempting to tackle the consequences of obesity using fiscal measures when the Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) is introduced in April, 2018(3). Recent data on the impact of health-related food and drink taxes from natural experimental evaluations are allowing us to better understand how fiscal measures affect behaviour. In this review, we draw on this new evidence and discuss how health-related food and drink taxes might change purchasing habits and improve health. Why implement food and drink taxes?

The absence of sales tax on food in certain states presents an economic scenario worth exploring. This policy can influence consumer behavior and state economies, offering benefits and challenges. States with No Sales Tax on Food Sales tax policies across the United States vary, with some states exempting food from sales tax entirely. This decision often aims to reduce the financial burden on residents, particularly those with lower incomes, by lowering the cost of essential goods. States like Oregon, Montana, and New Hampshire have embraced this approach, choosing to forgo the revenue a food tax might generate to support consumer purchasing power. In these states, the absence of a sales tax on food simplifies the shopping experience, as consumers are not required to calculate additional costs at checkout. This simplicity benefits families and individuals who are budgeting carefully, allowing them to allocate more resources to other necessities or savings. The policy can also attract residents and businesses considering relocation, as it effectively lowers the cost of living. However, states must balance the potential loss of revenue with the benefits of increased consumer spending and economic activity. This trade-off can influence budget allocations for public services and infrastructure, requiring careful fiscal management. States often rely on alternative revenue streams, such as income or property taxes, to fund their budgets. Impact on Consumer Spending Exempting sales tax on food can shift consumer spending patterns. Without additional taxes on groceries, consumers may have more disposable income for other expenditures, boosting local economies. The additional funds retained in consumers\u2019 budgets allow for greater financial flexibility, potentially leading to a higher quality of life. By not taxing fo",

Abstract Emerging evidence suggests a link between young people\u2019s interest in alternative food production practices and dietary quality. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the impact of a student-driven sustainable food systems education and promotion intervention on adolescent school lunch selection, consumption, and waste behaviors. Sixth grade science teachers at two middle schools (n = 268 students) implemented a standards-based curriculum on sustainable food systems, addressing the environmental impacts of food choices and food waste. The cumulating curriculum activity required the 6th grade students to share their food systems knowledge with their 7th and 8th grade counterparts (n = 426) through a cafeteria promotional campaign to discourage food waste. School-wide monthly plate waste assessments were used to evaluate changes in vegetable consumption and overall plate waste using a previously validated digital photography method.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The potential for nutrition labels to impact on population health is dependent on consumer ability to understand and use this information. Consumer understanding of this information varies across sociodemographic groups and with different label design formats. Labeling legislation requires consumer education on how to use nutrition labels, and recent mandatory changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel (NFP) are underway to improve comprehensibility. This review aimed to evaluate if educational programs can improve understanding and use of nutrition labels. Database searches were performed to identify interventions which delivered education on nutrition labels with outcomes measuring aspects of comprehension or use. A total of 17 studies were selected for review, including nine randomized and eight cohort studies. The majority of studies were conducted in the United States Study participants included school aged children, older adults, and those with diabetes within a range of intervention types involving taught sessions or web-based education.

Objectives We were interested in assessing intermediate outcomes along the assumed causal pathway to \u201cpolicy success\u201d, in addition to the final outcome of changed consumption patterns. Data sources We performed a search of 16 databases through October 2015, with no initial restriction by language. Study eligibility criteria We included all publications that reported the effect of statutory provisions aimed at reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods and beverages in the general population. We allowed all methodological approaches that contained some measure of comparison, including studies of implementation progress. Study appraisal and synthesis methods We reviewed included studies using the appraisal tools for pre-post and observational studies devel",

Researchers are working to connect the dots between fiscal food policies and consumer health New research examines whether broad-gauge policies like subsidies and taxes can encourage people to eat healthier (Sean Flynn / UConn Photo). Globally, millions of deaths every year can be attributed to bad diets, and these numbers are rising. These deaths are preventable, and one strategy to encourage consumers to make healthier choices is through fiscal policy, such as subsidies or taxes. Examples include taxes on products known to be bad for health, like tobacco and alcohol, with an aim to discourage consumers from purchasing these products. The World Health Organization (WHO) has recruited a team of researchers from UConn and the University of Illinois Chicago to assess if similar policies for food items impact health, in the hopes of providing policymakers around the world with data on the outcomes of these policy measures. They recently published two papers in the Journal of the American Medical Association, one focusing on economic and health outcomes of food taxes and subsidies, and another focusing on outcomes of taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages. One challenge the researchers encountered is that food taxe",

Although under particular conditions obesity is not preventable, drawing attention on factors affecting teenagers' preferences can ameliorate the efficacy of public interventions designed for health promotion. Methods: This study aims at eliciting teenagers' food preferences through a discrete choice experiment, conducted in Tuscany using a webAPP survey, with the participation of more than 4,700 teenagers. Respondents expressed their preferences for breakfast food based on three attributes: food quality, packaging and claim. The survey also collected information on respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, social influence and media use for food information. Results: Teenagers' preferences for healthy foods seem positively related with their own level of food literacy. The tendency of respondents to read labels and nutritional facts is positively associated with preferences for healthier foods. Peers' influence is not significant, while family influence has a positive ",

Abstract Context: Health promotion programs generate healthy changes in the educational community. However, not all of them meet the expected objectives due to multiple factors that affect their development, such as the teachers overload work, the lack of specific training, the lack of time to carry out health promotion activities, the lack of flexibility of the programs, and their non-inclusion in the training programs of the centers. Objective: To know the scope of the strategies and programs that promote healthy habits among students in compulsory educational stages.

Abstract Objective: Food taxation can improve diets by making unhealthy foods more expensive and by making healthy foods cheaper. In the Netherlands, a political window of opportunity arose in December 2021 to reduce the value-added tax (VAT) on fruits and vegetables to zero percent. The policy is now facing institutional friction along several fronts, however, delaying and potentially averting its implementation. We analysed this institutional friction to inform future food tax policies. Design: We qualitatively analysed open-access fiscal and health experts\u2019 position papers about benefits and downsides of the zero-rate that were discussed with members of parliament in June 2023. Setting: The Netherlands. Participants: Not applicable. Results: Health and fiscal experts expressed noticeably different viewpoints towards the utility of the zero-rate. One important argument fiscal experts based their negative advice upon pertained to the legal restrictions for distinguishing between healthier and unhealthier forms of fruits and vegetables (i.e. the principle of neutrality).

To tackle this, government sought to stimulate the production and distribution of as much inexpensive food as possible, in particular starchy (high carbohydrate) staple commodities and their shelf stable processed products. At the time, a global pandemic of obesity and chronic diseases from the widespread availability of inexpensive, unhealthy food was inconceivable. The relatively recent rise of diet related chronic diseases including obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and several cancers is at least partly a byproduct of these historical approaches and the responses of industry and consumers. A separate article in this series reviews the trends in nutrition science over this period,1 which have slowly shifted focus from undernutrition defined by calories and micronutrient deficiency to food based diet patterns and overall health effects of the food supply. Even with the unprecedented rise in diet related chronic diseases, government policies have continued to emphasise agricultural production of staple commodities and support for the food industry motivated by conventional perspectives on food security, economics, and trade. While undernutrition has improved with government supported systems changes such as agricultural development and fortification programmes,1 government has tended to use educational policy measures directed at individuals in response to the rise in chronic diseases. Such measures aim to influence diet quality by emphasising personal responsibility and choice through dietary guidelines, food labels, menu labelling, and clinical counselling. Growing e",

Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

We estimate the impact of the program on children\u2019s economic, educational, and health outcomes throughout life. Our results show that the school lunch program generated substantial long-term benefits, where pupils exposed to the program during their entire primary school period have 3% higher lifetime income. The effect was greater for pupils that were exposed at earlier ages and for pupils from poor households, suggesting that the program reduced socioeconomic inequalities in adulthood. Exposure to the program also had substantial effects on educational attainment and health, which can explain a large part of the effect of the program on lifetime income. 1. Introduction Disparities in health arise early in life and explain a large part of the variation in human capital and economic outcomes among adults (Heckman, 2007; Currie and Almond, 2011). A growing literature shows that targeted policies that improve conditions in the earliest year of life can reduce such gaps (Almond et al., 2018). Much less is known about the long-run effects of universal policies that improve health and nutrition during the \u201cmiddle\u201d period between birth and adulthood, where a large share of children can be reached through the education system at a low cost.

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat.

The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care.

Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out.

Contact Is the fat tax really effective? Recently, some European countries, including Spain, have considered introducing new taxes to reduce their budget deficits. Among the set of measures, they have proposed a fat tax, which has the aims of not only increasing revenues, but also reducing junk food consumption, and thereby obesity rates and the concomitant health costs. Although this is what we expect from the theory, empirical evidence is revelatory of a different picture. Firstly, the tax is not fully reflected in the prices of the products that have been targeted. In fact, in the countries where the tax has been imposed, supermarkets and other food stores have played with prices and margins of other products in an attempt to avoid raising the prices of the products that are subject to taxation. For example, some firms have increased the prices of substitutes (e.g. sodas with low calories) while spreading the higher cost of taxed food onto other foods or own-branded products that typically have higher profit margins. Another interesting reaction from the supply side has been that producers have been substituting those taxed products with un-taxed products that are just as unhealthy. Additionally, they have also reduced the amount of some inputs below the legal threshold to avoid the fat tax. Ostensibly, these tricks have clearly diminished the effectiveness of the tax. On the demand side, we have also seen interesting reactions. Firstly, it is important to notice that people who consume more junk food are less responsive to a price increase than moderate consumers. Hence, the fat tax is not actually benefiting its most important target audience. Furthermore, there is an important substitution effect as all products have, on the whole, become more expensive, consumers have switched",

Abstract National Nutritional Monitoring Bureau survey (2017) has found that more than half of the adults in India were overweight and obese. To halt this rising epidemic, development of various policy measures has been suggested in National action plan for prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. One such measure is the introduction of fat tax which is a surcharge or tax placed on food and beverages containing high amounts of fat. Government of India has made various direct budgetary initiatives for boosting the sectors related to the production of items rich in fat, sugars and salt without realizing the potential public health consequences. Hence, increasing the taxes for unhealthy junk foods should encourage the people to take healthier food options which in turn lead to positive impact on health. However, fat taxationfaced several challenges during implementation in countries like Denmark, Hungary, France and United States. Major challenges were the taxation debate, setting tax limit and encroaching into the autonomy",

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

A growing percentage of the population is moving toward obesity. For the average child born today, there is a 50/50 chance, if lifestyles do not change, that they will develop Type 2 diabetes or other physical diseases and conditions that are associated with being overweight. Several ideas have been brought forth to address the complex issue of obesity. One of them is the implementation of a \u201cfat tax.\u201d A fat tax is applied to any foods or drinks that are thought to be unhealthy or may contribute to the global obesity issue. A soda tax is a common form of a fat tax, but it could apply to candy, fried foods, fast food products, and food items with high levels of saturated fat. Here are the pros and cons of a fat tax to consider. What Are the Pros of a Fat Tax? 1. It could help to slow the rise in obesity that is being seen. According to ABC News, a 20% tax placed on sugar-sweetened drinks could lower obesity rates by as much as 3.5%. That could help to prevent up to 2,700 cardiovascular-related deaths that occur every year\u2026 and that is just in the United States. When looked at from a global perspective, about 20,000 people in the developed world could experience a reduced risk of premature death because of changes to their lifestyle that occur because of the changes that happen with a fat tax. 2. The proceeds from a fat tax could be used as subsidies for healthy foods. Although the goal of a fat tax is to curb the sale of unhealthy products without restricting a person\u2019s rights to choose that item, it doesn\u2019t stop the high price of fresh produce and other healthier eating options. For this reason, using the revenues from a fat tax to subsidize healthier foods can make it easier for everyone to access what they need for a healthier lifestyle. 3. It can improve p",

Taxes can be levied at the local, state and federal levels on income, sales, property and other activities. While some level of taxation is necessary to fund government operations, excessive taxation can have negative consequences. Taxation is a controversial economic and political issue, so people are likely to disagree about the advantages and disadvantages of taxes depending on their personal opinions. Understanding Consumer Spending Taxation has the potential to decrease consumer spending, because taxes take money away from consumers and reduce disposable income. Lower consumer spending tends to decrease business revenue, which can put negative pressure on hiring and investment. High taxes may inhibit economic growth, and the government sometimes institutes tax cuts during periods of economic hardship to encourage spending and growth. Opponents of taxation may also argue that taxes act as a disincentive to work, since they reduce the direct financial reward of earning income. Evaluating Business Expenses Taxation can increase the expenses that businesses face, which makes it more difficult for them to achieve profitability. Businesses pay numerous taxes, such as payroll taxes on employee wages, property taxes, business taxes and fees for permits and licenses. Business-related taxes leave less money for expanding businesses through investment and hiring. High business taxes may encourage outsourcing of operations abroad. Redistribution of Wealth Taxation is sometimes referred to as a \"redistribution of wealth\" because different people face different tax burdens and some people benefit more from government programs than others do.

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Stretching from ancient to recent history, the governed have often resisted unfair and costly taxes enforced by those of authority. This pattern extended from taxes such as the Stamp Act and Sugar Act from the Revolutionary War to post Greco\u2013Persian War Taxes which soon led to the fall of the Persian Empire. The use of a similar tax, a &quot;fat tax&quot;, is now being debated between the walls of Congress. This fat tax would be met with much resistance and would have many unintended repercussions. Although a fat tax would aid in deterring many from some unhealthy foods, introducing this tax would result in a heavy societal tax and be maladdressing this sensitive and complex issue... more content... Yet the problem lies in, not the idea, but the practicality, application, and implications of such a tax. The tax on these &quot;fatty foods&quot; would face many questions such as which foods would be considered fatty. Considering that the foods that would be taxed would be those high in fat, the type of fat would be another question which arises. According to Laura Salahi, foods such as nuts that are high in unsaturated fat provide many benefits such as the lowering of blood pressure and the reduction in the risk of heart disease, while Dr. Walt Willett further stated that unsaturated fats eaten in moderation may even help lead to healthy weight loss.

Larry Summers wants to tax \u2018junk foods\u2019 citing \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d of their negative health effects.\u00a0 Mr. Summers should look abroad first.\u00a0Denmark\u00a0is abandoning its effort to engineer a slimmer people while filling government coffers: It\u2019s the end for their fat tax on foodstuffs exceeding 2.3% saturated fat content, imposed only last year. So what went wrong? Little that wasn\u2019t predicted and predictable: The tax drove people to cheaper, lower quality, occasionally less fatty alternatives. And it drove Danes, quite literally, across the border to nearby\u00a0Germany\u00a0or\u00a0Sweden\u00a0to get their favorite foods. Danish television meanwhile scored high with a cooking show that extolled the virtues of butter. But do-gooder politicians have yet to repeal any tax just because it is not working, or impeding the daily lives of citizens. The fat tax was instead fried by Danish farmers complaining of the high administrative cost of fat-tax compliance, and losing business to foreign competitors who were running away with the bacon and the kringles. A planned Danish sugar tax has, for the same reasons, been shelved for now. Even then, no tax will just disappear: Danish politicians plan on filling the $200 million revenue gap left by the fat tax by raising the income tax. That\u2019s richer than those tax-threatened cheeses, since the fat tax came in addition to other taxes, without offsets. Yet the new income tax hike is marketed as offsetting lost revenue! That confirms this tax scheme was never more than a tax-hike masquerading as a public health measure. Health\u00a0benefits for Danes, only 13% of whom count as obese, seem dubious, and none are being claimed..\u00a0 It\u2019s true that picking customer\u2019s wallets at food-store checkouts can alter behavior, but hardly in the desired direction.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

In fact, approximately 70% of adults in the United States are overweight. Among them, about one-third are obese. What makes obesity such a risk factor? Many chronic diseases exist, including heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, and certain forms of cancer. Among the solutions proposed for the obesity epidemic is a fat tax. Fat Tax 101 In general, a fat tax is a tax on unhealthy foods and drinks, such as sugary drinks, fast food, and processed foods. By imposing a fat tax, people will be discouraged from consuming unhealthy foods and encouraged to make healthier choices. However, this isn't exactly a revolutionary idea. According to the Metabo Law of Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents don't meet certain health landmarks. As a result of the law, which passed in 2008, residents can live a healthier lifestyle. Every year, companies must measure the waists of their employees as required by law. An employer is fined if an employee's waist measurement exceeds 33.5 inches (85 cm) for men or 35.4 inches (90 cm) for women. Counseling, motivational support, and email and phone monitoring are provided to the employee. However, October 2011 saw Denmark introduce the world's fi",

The Question Taking Over the Internet In today\u2019s society, obesity has become a prevalent public health issue affecting people of all ages and backgrounds. With approximately 70% of adults in the United States being overweight and about one-third classified as obese, it is clear that urgent measures are needed to address this epidemic (source). One proposed solution to combat obesity is implementing a fat tax, which imposes taxes on unhealthy foods and drinks such as sugary beverages, fast food, and processed foods. However, before delving into a fat tax\u2019s potential benefits and drawbacks, let\u2019s first understand what it entails. This examination started when the retirement publcation Due asked the fat tax question,\u00a0\u201cIs America About to Start Charging Businesses for Fat Employees?\u201d Fat Tax 101 A fat tax is a tax levied on foods and beverages considered unhealthy or high in fat content. The primary goal of this tax is to discourage the consumption of such products and encourage individuals to make healthier food choices. While the concept of a fat tax may seem innovative, countries like Japan have already implemented similar measures. In Japan, companies and local governments are taxed if their employees or residents fail to meet specific health standards. This approach, known as the Metabo Law, has successfully promoted healthier lifestyles among residents. Another notable example of a fat tax is Denmark\u2019s introduction of the world\u2019s first \u201cfat tax\u201d in 2011. This tax aimed to reduce obesity and cardiovascular disease by taxing foods that contained more than 2.3% saturated fat. However, the effectiveness of fat taxes in addressing the obesity epidemic remains a subject of debate, and various countries have experimented with different approaches to combat the issue.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Tatiana Chud\u00e1,1Petr Jansk\u00fd* Abstract Health-motivated taxes have spread over the world to reduce increasing obesity and corresponding health care costs. These taxes have not yet been implemented in the Czech Republic, in contrast to some other, mainly European countries. However, the introduction of a\u00a0fat tax has been discussed frequently in the Czech Republic during the last few years; here, we provide empirical evidence in order for this public debate to be better informed. We use detailed microeconomic data to estimate the impact of potential fat taxes on household expenditure and government revenues in the Czech Republic. We evaluate the impact of three types of fat taxes: ad valorem, specific per kilogram of product and specific per kilogram of fat. We simulate these in such a\u00a0way that they all raise the same budget revenues as a\u00a010% ad valorem tax on fat-rich products. Accounting for higher food expenditures in the aggregate national accounts than in the detailed microeconomic data results into higher budget revenues, 7.3 and 6.1 billion Czech korunas, respectively. Overall we find, and thus confirm the overwhelming evidence from other countries, that fat taxes are regressive in income.

Introduction Many countries are facing an increasingly overweight population, with a growing pre- valence of obesity and other health problems caused by an unhealthy diet and lifestyle. One in three adults in the world was overweight or obese in 2008, according to the Overseas Development Institute (2014). A high fat intake and unsuitable composition of fatty acids in the diet are the underlying cause of many non-communicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (Dost\u00e1lov\u00e1, 2011).

Abstract In 2011, Denmark introduced the world's first tax on saturated fat, but only 15 months later the fat tax was abolished. The aim of this article is to investigate the political processes surrounding the implementation and rapid abolition of the fat tax. Our findings suggest that industry and trade associations were heavily involved in the political process of formulating the fat tax. Industry representatives used certain tactics to oppose the fat tax: threatening lawsuits, predicting welfare losses, casting doubt on evidence, diverting focus and requesting postponement. After the fat tax was implemented, the food industry continued their opposition through intensified lobbyism and juridical actions at EU level. However, other factors seem to have contributed to the fall of the fat tax. The tax received criticism for being poorly designed and gradually lost popularity among health professionals, politicians and the public. In the end, the fat tax was abolished for financial reaso",

By: Esteban Ortiz-Ospina and Max Roser This page was first published in September 2016 and last revised in March 2023. Taxation is, by and large, the most important source of government revenue in nearly all countries. We begin this topic page by providing an overview of historical changes in taxation patterns, and then move on to an analysis of available data from the last couple of decades, discussing trends and patterns in taxation around the world. From a historical perspective, the growth of governments and the extent to which they are able to collect revenues from their citizens is a striking economic feature of the last two centuries. The available long-run data shows that in the process of development, states have increased the levels of taxation, while at the same time changing the patterns of taxation, mainly by providing an increasing emphasis on broader tax bases. Taxation patterns around the world today reveal large cross-country differences, especially between developed and developing countries. In particular, developed countries today collect a much larger share of their national output in taxes than do developing countries; and they tend to rely more on income taxation to do so. Developing countries, in contrast, rely more heavily on trade taxes, as well as taxes on consumption. Moreover, the data shows that developed countries actually collect much higher tax revenue than developing countries despite comparable statutory taxation rates, even after controlling for underlying differences in economic activity. This suggests that cross-country heterogeneity in fiscal capacity is largely determined by differences in compliance and efficiency of tax collection mechanisms. Both of these factors seem to be affected by the strength of political institutions. In the last part of this topic page, we provide an overview of empirical evidence regarding the equity and efficiency implication",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Powell, Institute for Health Research and Policy and Department of Economics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 West Roosevelt, Room 558, Chicago, IL 60608 (email: powelll@uic.edu). Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

ABSTRACT The evidence for social and environmental factors that contribute to obesity are often underappreciated. Obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status, which creates complex relationships between each of these characteristics. Food availability remains an important factor associated with obesity that relates to differences in prevalence seen across geographical areas and higher rates of obesity within low socioeconomic status individuals. Proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are or perceived as more affordable combined with reductions in occupational and transportation related physical activity can contribute to a sustained positive energy balance. Additionally, environments experiencing deprivation, disorder, or high crime have been shown to be associated with higher odds of obesity, which may appear more frequently in low social status individuals. Both objective and subjective measures of social status and inequality are associated with increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure, which could place individuals of low social status at greater risk for obesity d",

One opportunity for preventing the onset of obesity is to focus on its social determinants. Socioeconomic status (SES), which includes factors such as income, educational attainment, occupational prestige, and access to resources, is a key determinant of obesity. In this scoping mini-review, we summarized review articles and meta-analyses of the SES-obesity association. From the 1980s to the present, cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a persistent socioeconomic gradient in obesity in which the association is negative in developed countries and positive in developing countries. Longitudinal studies have revealed the bidirectionality of the SES-obesity association; some studies demonstrate that socioeconomic adversity precedes the onset of obesity, while others provide evidence of reverse causality. While earlier studies relied on anthropometric assessments of weight and height to define obesity, the use of modern technologies like dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance have demonstrated that the socioeconomic gradient in obesity is robust across multiple indicators of body composition, including direct measures of lean and fat mass. More recently, examination of mediators and moderators of the SES-obesity association have highlighted causal pathways and potential intervention targets, with a focus on health behaviors, environmental conditions, psychological factors, and biological processes. We describe current gaps in knowledge and propose opportunities for future innovation to reduce the burden of obesity and related socioeconomic disparities.

However, much of what is known about the economic impacts of obesity comes from high-income countries and studies are not readily comparable due to methodological differences. Our objective is to demonstrate a method for estimating current and future national economic impacts of obesity and apply it across a sample of heterogeneous contexts globally. Methods We estimated economic impacts of overweight and obesity for eight countries using a cost-of-illness approach. Direct and indirect costs of obesity from 2019 to 2060 were estimated from a societal perspective as well as the effect of two hypothetical scenarios of obesity prevalence projections.

The available data suggest that the global burden of obesity has more than tripled since 1975 (1). It is particularly high in some first world countries. However, recent data show that obesity is spreading very fast in low-and middle-income countries (LIMICs), and has reached world record level in some of them (2). At the country level, around 42% of adults in the US are obese, compared to estimates four decades earlier of about 13%. Similarly, in the United Kingdom, prevalence has increased to about 25%. In the LMICs, high obesity is apparent in Brazil, China, Egypt, South Africa, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Pakistan and Russia, while prevalence is more than 75% in countries such as Tonga, Samoa, and Kiribati (3). Obesity forecasts (4) are for continuing growth, with the study (Nianogo and Arah) proposing a micro-simulation model for forecasting cohort obesity. In racial and ethnic minority sub-groups, such as non-Hispanic blacks in the US, obesity has reached half the adult population. There is also considerable variation between socio-economic groups and geographic areas in the obesity burden: for example, the prevalence of adult obesity varies widely across upper tier local authorities in England, ranging from 11 to 40%. Obesity is a major cause of premature death, is implicated in recent slowing in improved life expectancy (5), and increases the risk of a range of chronic diseases. There is a seven times greater risk of diabetes in the obese as against those of healthy weight, with a three-fold increase in risk for overweight people (6). Elevated body mass index (BMI) is thought to account for 20% of hypertension and coronary-heart disease (6). There are many contributing factors to obesity in individual behavior patterns, such as po",

Many people blame obesity on poor dietary choices and inactivity, but it\u2019s not always that simple. Other factors can have powerful effects on body weight and obesity, some of which are outside of a person\u2019s control. These include genetics, environmental factors, certain medical conditions, and more. This article lists 9 compelling reasons why obesity is not just a choice. 1. Genetics and prenatal factors Health is especially important during early life, as this affects your health later on. In fact, a lot can be determined while the fetus is still in the womb (2). A mother\u2019s diet and lifestyle choices matter a great deal and may influence a baby\u2019s future behavior and body composition. Studies show that women who gain excessive weight during pregnancy are more likely to have heavy 3-year-olds (3, 4). Similarly, children who have parents and grandparents who have obesity are much more likely to have obesity than kids with parents and grandparents who are normal weight (5, 6). Furthermore, the genes you inherit from your parents may determine your susceptibility to weight gain (7). Though genetics and early life factors are not exclusively responsible for obesity, they contribute to the problem by predisposing people to weight gain. About 40% of children with excess weight will continue to be heavy during their teenage years, and 75\u221280% of teenagers with obesity will maintain this condition into adulthood (8). SUMMARY Genetics, a mother\u2019s weight, and family history can all increase the likelihood of childhood and adult ob",

Moreover, there are at least 1 billion more people at risk of becoming overweight or obese.

About 3 in 4 adults in the United States have obesity. Causes include hormones related to appetite and metabolism, which can be altered by environmental and medical conditions, genetics, and medications. Even the body's collection of microorganisms, known as the microbiome, plays a role. Read on to learn more about obesity and its causes. SDI Productions / Getty Images Defining Obesity The medical definition of obesity is a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or greater. BMI is a calculation of weight (in kilograms) divided by height (in meters squared) to gain a sense of weight per height. However, using BMI can be problematic, since body weight doesn't directly correlate with body fat. It's important to understand this when calculating and interpreting BMI. For example, a very fit and muscular person will have a higher BMI because muscle weighs more than fat, and they won't necessarily have obesity or be at a high risk of obesity-related complications. BMI is a dated, flawed measure. It does not take into account factors such as body composition, ethnicity, sex, race, and age. Even though it is a biased measure, BMI is still widely used in the medical community because it\u2019s an inexpensive and quick way to analyze a person\u2019s potential health status and outcomes. There are other ways to measure body fat, such as dual-energy X-ray absorption (DEXA), underwater weighing, and bioelectrical impedance. However, these methods aren't as widely available as BMI measurements. Measuring skin fold thickness with calipers is an alternative method, but it can be difficult to standardize. BMI is a simpler and easily measured way to screen for obesity, but it is still a problematic measurement that may need to be re-interpreted in the proper context for individuals.

Three specific types of taxes are studied in the literature: food group taxes; nutrient taxes; and nutrient index taxes. Anumber of studies use food expenditure data to assess the impact of various taxes on obesity and therefore only indirectly measure the impacts of taxes and subsidies on obesity. These studies generally conclude that food group taxes, nutrient taxes and nutrient index taxes have a small impact on the purchases of food and the nutrients purchased. Other studies use the body mass index as the explanatory variable and thus measure the impacts of taxes on body mass index directly. Nutrient taxes are found to be more effective than food group taxes, although even for nutrient taxes, the effects are small. In general, thin subsidies seem to offer more effective control of obesity than obesity taxes. However, due to the small effects of both fat taxes and thin subsidies, they are not recommended as instruments of food and nutrition policy.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Accelerating Progress in Obesity Prevention: Solving the Weight of the Nation. 3Goals, Targets, and Strategies for Change Key Messages It is clear from the preceding chapters that tremendous strides have been made in addressing the obesity epidemic, given the sheer amount of attention to the problem and the number and coherence of efforts to address the epidemic and bolster the scientific underpinnings and policy basis for taking action. Evidence of the stabilization of obesity prevalence in at least some demographic groups suggests that these deliberate initiatives to address the epidemic are on track, perhaps in concert with other, spontaneous countering forces. Given the scope and scale of what is needed and the inevitability of a time lag before true progress can be estimated, however, the developments to date create a unique opportunity to restate goals and refine targets and approaches in order to accelerate progress. As reviewed in this chapter, the goals themselves are clear with respect to the desired outcomes, as well as the types of behavioral changes that are relevant. There is not yet agreement on what specific set of strategies and actions will best curb and ulti",

Continuing Education Activity Obesity is an alarmingly increasing global public health issue. Several countries worldwide have witnessed a double or triple escalation in the prevalence of obesity in the last three decades, probably due to urbanization, sedentary lifestyle, and increase consumption of high-calorie processed food. The alarming increase in childhood obesity foreshows a tremendous burden of chronic disease prevention in the future public healthcare systems worldwide. Obesity prevention is a critical factor in controlling Obesity-related Non-communicable diseases (OR-NCDs), including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, hypertension, cancer, and psychological problems. This activity reviews the public health considerations in obesity and highlights the role of the interprofessional team in developing public health strategies for the management and prevention of this condition.

It has been increasing among adults of all races and ethnicities over the last two decades; however, obesity is higher among Non-Hispanic Black adults, Hispanic adults, and American Indian or Alaska Native adults, than their White and Asian counterparts, according to the National Institutes of Health. Adults with lower income also have higher risk of obesity than those with a high income. A George Mason University College of Public Health team of interprofessional researchers analyzed the last five years of literature to determine how social and structural determinants of health and social injustice impact the risk of obesity, its treatment and treatment outcomes, and explored the implications for prevention and future treatment interventions. \"We found that social determinants of health, such as where someone lives, and social inequities are primary drivers of obesity disparities,\" said Michelle S. Williams, associate professor of community and global health. \"Many of these determinants can be modified through interventions to reduce obesity.\" \"Population-based, equity-focused interventions that address the underlying causes of obesity disparities are needed to reduce these disparities and improve the health outcomes of minoritized and marginalized groups,\" said Lawrence Cheskin, professor of nutrition and food studies. \"The good news is that there are successful examples of public health interventions that communities can support to reduce obesity.\" Successful examples include community-based interventions that focus on improving neighborhood conditions, discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages, expanding access to obesity treatment, building safe green and play spaces, and ensuring equitable access to fruits and vegetables. \"Even with these known successful interventions, more work needs to be done to expand and broaden programs, activities, and initiatives at the loca",

One opportunity for preventing the onset of obesity is to focus on its social determinants. Socioeconomic status (SES), which includes factors such as income, educational attainment, occupational prestige, and access to resources, is a key determinant of obesity. In this scoping mini-review, we summarized review articles and meta-analyses of the SES-obesity association. From the 1980s to the present, cross-sectional studies have demonstrated a persistent socioeconomic gradient in obesity in which the association is negative in developed countries and positive in developing countries. Longitudinal studies have revealed the bidirectionality of the SES-obesity association; some studies demonstrate that socioeconomic adversity precedes the onset of obesity, while others provide evidence of reverse causality. While earlier studies relied on anthropometric assessments of weight and height to define obesity, the use of modern technologies like dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and bioelectrical impedance have demonstrated that the socioeconomic gradient in obesity is robust across multiple indicators of body composition, including direct measures of lean and fat mass. More recently, examination of mediators and moderators of the SES-obesity association have highlighted causal pathways and potential intervention targets, with a focus on health behaviors, environmental conditions, psychological factors, and biological processes. We describe current gaps in knowledge and propose opportunities for future innovation to reduce the burden of obesity and related socioeconomic disparities.

INTRODUCTION Obesity is one of the most pressing public health disorders in the United States and other westernized societies. Its prevalence is increasing worldwide and it is associated with concerning medical comorbidities, most notably the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes [1-4]. Hence, innovative research that elucidates the causes of obesity has become an increasingly important focus for the National Institutes of Health. A challenge to this mission, however, is that fact that obesity is a \u201ccomplex disorder.\u201d For most individuals in the population, obesity results from multiple genetic and environmental factors that may interact with, or may be correlated with, each other.

Recent Findings Racial and ethnic minorities, such as non-Hispanic Black adults and Hispanic adults, and adults with a low socioeconomic status have a greater risk of obesity than non-Hispanic white adults and adults with a high socioeconomic status. The underlying causes of obesity disparities include obesogenic neighborhood environments, inequities in access to obesity treatment, and lack of access to affordable nutrient-dense foods. Experts have called for interventions that address the social and structural determinants of obesity disparities. Population-based interventions that focus on improving neighborhood conditions, discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages, expanding access to obesity treatment, and ensuring equitable access to fruits and vegetables have been proven to be effective. Summary There is a growing body of evidence that shows the relationship between social and structural determinants of health and injustice on disparities in obesity among racial and ethnic minorities and individuals with a low SES. Population-based, equity-focused interventions that address the underlying causes of obesity disparities are needed to reduce obesity disparities and improve the health outcomes of minoritized and marginalized groups.

Obesity represents a major health challenge because it substantially increases the risk of diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, fatty liver disease, hypertension, myocardial infarction, stroke, dementia, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnoea and several cancers, thereby contributing to a decline in both quality of life and life expectancy. Obesity is also associated with unemployment, social disadvantages and reduced socio-economic productivity, thus increasingly creating an economic burden. Thus far, obesity prevention and treatment strategies \u2014 both at the individual and population level \u2014 have not been successful in the long term. Lifestyle and behavioural interventions aimed at reducing calorie intake and increasing energy expenditure have limited effectiveness because complex and persistent hormonal, metabolic and neurochemical adaptations defend against weight loss and promote weight regain. Reducing the obesity burden requires approaches that combine individual interventions with changes in the environment and society. Therefore, a better understanding of the remarkable regional differences in obesity prevalence and trends might help to identify societal causes of obesity and provide guidance on which are the most promising intervention strategies. Key points Obesity prevalence has increased in pandemic dimensions over the past 50 years. Obesity is a disease that",

Summary We undertook a systematic review of studies assessing the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and measured obesity in low- and middle-income countries (defined by the World Bank as countries with per capita income up to US$12,275) among children, men and women. The evidence on the subject has grown significantly since an earlier influential review was published in 2004. We find that in low-income countries or in countries with low human development index (HDI), the association between SES and obesity appears to be positive for both men and women: the more affluent and/or those with higher educational attainment tend to be more likely to be obese. However, in middle-income countries or in countries with medium HDI, the association becomes largely mixed for men and mainly negative for women. This particular shift appears to occur at an even lower level of per capita income than suggested by an influential earlier review. By contrast, obesity in children appears to be predominantly a problem of the rich in low- and middle-income countries. Keywords: Developing countries, obesity, socioeconomic status Introduction In",

ABSTRACT The evidence for social and environmental factors that contribute to obesity are often underappreciated. Obesity prevalence is significantly associated with sex, racial ethnic identity, and socioeconomic status, which creates complex relationships between each of these characteristics. Food availability remains an important factor associated with obesity that relates to differences in prevalence seen across geographical areas and higher rates of obesity within low socioeconomic status individuals. Proliferation of high calorie, energy dense food options that are or perceived as more affordable combined with reductions in occupational and transportation related physical activity can contribute to a sustained positive energy balance. Additionally, environments experiencing deprivation, disorder, or high crime have been shown to be associated with higher odds of obesity, which may appear more frequently in low social status individuals. Both objective and subjective measures of social status and inequality are associated with increased energy intake and decreased energy expenditure, which could place individuals of low social status at greater risk for obesity d",

Introduction: Childhood obesity is a critical public health issue, with one-third of all children and adolescents in the U.S. being either overweight or obese.1 Children who are overweight in kindergarten are four times more likely than healthy-weight children to be obese at age fourteen.2 Despite advances in obesity research, insufficient evidence exists about how children develop obesogenic behaviors such as inactivity and poor nutritional preferences, especially in families of low socioeconomic status (SES). Recent studies suggest that children begin to develop health behaviors and attitudes as young as 5 years of age.3 Children as young as 4 or 5 may begin internalizing their parents\u2019 physical activity and dietary habits. A previous study shows that 71 percent of childhood obesity is explained by the influence of family factors on young children.4 This suggests that early childhood may provide the best window of opportunity for modifying environmental risk factors for childhood obesity. The etiology of childhood obesity appears to be multifactorial. Child behavioral risk factors known to increase obesity risk include decreased physical activity rates,5 increased time playing video games and watching te",

Diverse research databases (including CINAHL, ERIC, MEDLINE, and Social Science Abstracts) were comprehensively searched during the years 1988\u20132004 inclusive, using \u201cobesity,\u201d \u201csocioeconomic status,\u201d and synonyms as search terms. A total of 333 published studies, representing 1,914 primarily cross-sectional associations, were included in the review. The overall pattern of results, for both men and women, was of an increasing proportion of positive associations and a decreasing proportion of negative associations as one moved from countries with high levels of socioeconomic development to countries with medium and low levels of development. Findings varied by SES indicator; for example, negative associations (lower SES associated with larger body size) for women in highly developed countries were most common with education and occupation, while positive associations for women in medium- and low-development countries were most common with income and material possessions. Patterns for women in higher- versus lower-development countries were generally less striking than those observed by Sobal and Stunkard; this finding is interpreted in light of trends related to globalization. Results underscore a view of obesity as a social phenomenon, for which appropriate action includes targeting both economic and sociocultural factors.

All You Need to Know Food deserts are communities that have poor access to healthy, affordable foods (1, 2). Also known as healthy food priority areas, food deserts are concentrated in low-income and historically marginalized areas throughout the United States (1, 2, 3, 4). In food deserts, healthy foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, peas, beans, meat, and fish are often expensive or unobtainable. The lack of access to healthy foods in these communities translates to health disparities and high rates of chronic disease (4, 5, 6). This article examines the causes, health effects, and potential solutions for food deserts. Causes of food deserts The causes of food deserts are multifaceted. Public policy and economic practices that are embedded in systemic racism often play a role. Social, economic, and political conditions have been shown to reduce people\u2019s access to healthy foods. Contributing factors include food insecurity, social determinants of health, racial residential segregation, and poor access to transportation among low-income and historically marginalized populations (1, 7, 8, 9). Food apartheid Apartheid is an enforced form of racial segregation. \u201cFood apartheid,\u201d however, is an emerging term meant to address the root causes of poor access to healthy, nutrient-dense foods by communities of color and low-income white people. Food activists like Karen Washington, Malik Yakini, and Dara Cooper believe that this term more accurately represents the systemic racism and health inequities of a corporate-controlled food system. The term \u201cfood desert\u201d is sometimes scrutinized for its misrepresentation of th",

The Public Health Effects of Food Deserts: Workshop Summary. 1Introduction BACKGROUND The term \u201cfood deserts\u201d describes neighborhoods and communities that have limited access to affordable and nutritious foods. The term was first used in Scotland and characterized neighborhoods that can encompass many thousands of people and/or an extensive land area as defined by city blocks or square miles. In the United States, food deserts tend to be located in urban and rural low-income neighborhoods, where residents are less likely to have access to supermarkets or grocery stores that provide healthy food choices. For communities with few food retailers or supermarkets that stock little or no fresh produce, low-fat dairy, whole grains, and other healthy foods, those populations may be more likely to suffer from high rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. Research into the health implications of food deserts began in the United Kingdom in the 1990s, although economists and geographers had been studying spatial determinants of firm location, transaction costs, and differential prices of food for the poor since at least the 1960s. Sponsor representative Laurian Unnevehr, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s Economic Research Service, pointed out in the introductory workshop session that community organizers have s",

Abstract The retail food environment plays an important role in shaping dietary habits that contribute to obesity and other chronic diseases. Food and beverage manufacturers use trade promotion\u2014incentives paid to retailers\u2014to influence how products are placed, priced, and promoted in stores. This review aims to: (1) catalogue trade promotion practices that manufacturers use to influence retailer marketing strategies, and (2) describe how these retailer marketing strategies affect consumer purchasing behavior and attitudes. Researchers searched five databases, Academic Search Ultimate, Business Source Ultimate, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Web of Science, to identify literature from industry and academic sources published in English through November 2019. Twenty articles describing manufacturer trade promotion practices were synthesized and provided insight into four types of trade promotion practices: category management, slotting allowances, price discounts, and cooperative advertising. Fifty-four articles describing the impact of retailer marketing on consumers were synthesized and graded for quality of evidence. While comp",

This article explores the impact of food influencers in today\u2019s digital landscape, examining how they influence dietary choices, drive food trends, and collaborate with brands, while also considering their role in promoting health, sustainability, and the criticisms they face. 1: The Emergence of Food Influencers The rise of food influencers marks a significant shift in how culinary content is consumed and shared. Unlike traditional culinary experts and chefs, these influencers leverage social media platforms to reach a broad audience. They blend personal stories with culinary expertise, making their content more relatable and accessible. This will trace the brief history of food influencers, highlighting how platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube have been instrumental in catapulting them to prominence and how they differ from traditional culinary figures in terms of content and audience engagement. 2: Influence on Dietary Choices Food influencers have a profound impact on the dietary choices and habits of their audience. Through visually appealing content and persuasive narratives, they have popularized various food trends such as superfoods, veganism, and meal prepping. This will discuss specific examples of trends driven by influencers and explore the power of visual and narrative appeal in shaping public eating habits. It will delve into how influencers, through their recommendations and endorsements, influence what and how people eat in contemporary society. 3: Marketing and Collaboration with Brands The relationship between food influencers and brands is a critical aspect of their impact.

We may believe that we make informed decisions about food choice, but we cannot do so if we are oblivious of the ways food companies influence our choices.4 \u2013 Marion Nestle \u201cA basic misconception has stymied our response to the obesity epidemic: the belief that food-related decisions are consciously and deliberately made. Our reluctance to interfere with or regulate the food environment is a direct consequence of the belief that people's food choices reflect their true desires. \u2026 The reality is that food choices are often automatic and made without full conscious awareness.\u201d \u2013 Deborah Cohen and Susan Babey1 Image copyright. Marketing is a priority for the success of any business, from small-scale, independent farms to multinational food manufacturers. Food marketing takes many forms and can involve building relationships with customers, raising brand awareness, developing new products, promoting them through advertising, and even paying grocery stores for prominent shelf space, all with the goal of promoting sales. For better and for worse, food marketing may have a powerful effect on what people eat\u2014and ultimately their health. U.S. food and beverage manufacturers focus most of their marketing efforts on promoting sales of soft drinks, breakfast cereals, candy, snacks, and other nutrient-poor products.2,3\u00a0In environments engineered to encourage purchases of these products, willpower and knowing how to eat healthy, while important, are often not enough to stop people from indulging in eating behaviors that increase their risks for diet-related disease.1,4 The potential for marketing to influence diets and health raises important questions: To what degree are individuals responsible for their own food choices, versus the companies that leverage their knowledge of human psychology to promote sales of their products? And what, if any, is the role of government in regulating food marketing, particularly t",

This article is published and distributed under the terms of the Oxford University Press, Standard Journals Publication Model (https://academic.oup.com/pages/standard-publication-reuse-rights) Abstract In recent decades, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes has risen substantially in North America and worldwide. To address these dual epidemics, researchers and policymakers alike have been searching for effective means to promote healthy lifestyles at a population level. As a consequence, there has been a proliferation of research examining how the \u201cbuilt\u201d environment in which we live influences physical activity levels, by promoting active forms of transportation, such as walking and cycling, over passive ones, such as car use. Shifting the transportation choices of local residents may mean that more members of the population can participate in physical activity during their daily routine without structured exercise programs. Increasingly, this line of research has considered the downstream metabolic consequences of the environment in which we live, raising the possibility that \u201chealthier\u201d community designs could help mitigate the rise in obesity and diabetes prevalence.

Abstract Purpose of Review Stress has long been suspected to be interrelated to (abdominal) obesity. However, interindividual differences in this complex relationship exist. We suggest that the extent of glucocorticoid action partly explains these interindividual differences. We provide latest insights with respect to multiple types of stressors. Recent Findings Increased long-term cortisol levels, as measured in scalp hair, are strongly related to abdominal obesity and to specific mental disorders. However, not all obese patients have elevated cortisol levels. Possibly, the interindividual variation in glucocorticoid sensitivity, which is partly genetically determined, may lead to higher vulnerability to mental or physical stressors. Other evidence for the important role for increased glucocorticoid action is provided by recent studies investigating associations between body composition and local and systemic corticosteroids. Summary Stress may play a major role in the development and maintenance of obesity in individuals who have an increased glucocorticoid expos",

First, stress interferes with cognitive processes such as executive function and self-regulation. Second, stress can affect behavior by inducing overeating and consumption of foods that are high in calories, fat, or sugar; by decreasing physical activity; and by shortening sleep. Third, stress triggers physiological changes in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, reward processing in the brain, and possibly the gut microbiome. Finally, stress can stimulate production of biochemical hormones and peptides such as leptin, ghrelin, and neuropeptide Y. Obesity itself can be a stressful state due to the high prevalence of weight stigma. This article therefore traces the contribution of weight stigma to stress and obesogenic processes, ultimately describing a vicious cycle of stress to obesity to stigma to stress. Current obesity prevention efforts focus solely on eating and exercise; the evidence reviewed in this article points to stress as an important but currently overlooked public policy target.

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

The tax could be placed on foods high in sugar/fat, such as crisps, chocolate and deep fried takeaways. The argument is that a fat tax would encourage healthier eating and raise revenue to be spent on public health care. Critics argue the tax will be regressive \u2013 taking more from low-income groups. It would be similar in principle to a cigarette or alcohol tax. Pros of a Fat Tax Cons of Fat Tax 25 thoughts on \u201cPros and Cons of Fat Tax\u201d In my opinion i think it would be a terrible idea to tax food and drinks as this affects the country overall. For instant people who are not over weight will also have to pay these taxes and most people are in poverty. furthermore this would be unfair to the overall community as britain has around 23% of obese people out of the other countries. If you tax \u2018fatty\u2019 foods \u2013 healthy foods will be relatively cheaper. In theory tax on sugar could be used to subsidise cheaper vegetables for population. Yeah I think you are totally correct. But what about the increased amount of money you spend to cur the various illnesses like heart disease and cancer which is more expensive to treat than all cancer treatments combined, so therefore it is a much better idea to eat healthy and not pay extra hospital bills, A fat tax sounds very wrong and I found myself joining in to complain about it. But on further thoughts and seeing all the health problems resulting from obesity, I would think it\u2019s the most logical thing to do. Why should the tax payers support those who wish to enjoy their food rather than control their diet for good health. Quit complaining \u201cObese people have lower life expectancy and so save government pension costs and health care costs in old age.\u201d Not sure the evidence bears this out. Fat people tend to have a similar life expectancy to healthy weight people, but have less healthy lives, and hence are a burden on healthcare for longer. http://",

View all partners It\u2019s now more commonly known that alcohol and tobacco use make us ill. Less known is that just four industries account for at least one-third of global preventable deaths. These industries are: unhealthy processed food and drinks, fossil fuels, alcohol and tobacco. Collectively they cause 19 million deaths every year, according to a recent series of reports published in The Lancet. These deaths happen because of accepted business practices that prioritise profit over health - and not only through the companies\u2019 products. This include cigarettes that cause cancer, sugary drinks that result in obesity or coal that drives carbon dioxide emissions, for example. The world\u2019s largest commercial companies routinely operate in a way that masks their practices and allows them to continue and expand in the name of neoliberal economic freedoms. These transnational corporations drive rapidly rising sickness and death levels, disability, environmental damage, and widening social inequities. The Lancet series describes a \u201cpathological system\u201d in which a substantial group of commercial actors are increasingly enabled to cause harm and to make others pay the costs of doing so. They profit without bearing any of the costs of the harmful products marketed to an unsuspecting public.

Abstract Public-private partnerships (PPPs) and whole-of-society approaches are increasingly common in public health promotion and non-communicable disease (NCD) prevention, despite a lack of evidence in favour of their effectiveness in improving health outcomes. While PPPs may have advantages, they also give industry actors more influence over the design and implementation of public health strategies and interventions. Partnering with unhealthy commodity industries in particular \u2013 including the alcohol and ultra-processed food and beverages industries \u2013 can pose significant risks to public health due to these industries\u2019 deep-rooted conflicts of interest.

Collection date 2018 Sep-Oct. Overview The fundamental concern as we look to reform health in America is the known reality that most chronic diseases that afflict Americans are predominantly lifestyle induced; and the belief is that the vast majority of heart attacks and strokes could be prevented if people were willing to adopt healthy lifestyle behaviors. In addition, healthy lifestyles would impact a significant number of cancers which are also believed to be related to lifestyle exposures, especially to obesity, cigarettes, and other toxins. Over the past 50 years, the health of Americans has gotten worse, and now 71% of Americans are overweight or obese\u2014not 66%, which was reported 5 years ago.1 That means a staggering 100 million people in America are obese. Today, eating processed foods and fast foods may kill more people prematurely than cigarette smoking.2 Authorities determined the 71% figure by classifying people with a body mass index (BMI) over 25 kg/m2 as overweight or obese. Yet in long-lived societies such as in the \u201cBlue Zones\u201d (Ikaria, Greece; Sardinia, Italy; Okinawa, Japan; the Nicoya Peninsula of Costa Rica; and Loma, Linda California) and wherever we find groups of centenarians, we observe a healthy BMI below 23 kg/m2, not 25 kg/m2.

Lipids, commonly referred to as fats, are a large family of organic, water-insoluble molecules present in many foods and naturally occurring in the body, according to Paul Insel, et al., in \u201cNutrition.\u201d Although consuming lipids is a dietary necessity as fat is a major constituent in cell membrane, blood and body fluids, in excess these compounds can prove detrimental to your health. Cardiovascular Complications Too much lipid consumption can lead to an array of cardiovascular complications. Saturated fat is especially harmful as it can cause high blood cholesterol, leading to arterial hardening, heart disease and stroke, according to MedlinePlus. The American Heart Association, or AHA, says that saturated fat is the main dietary cause of high cholesterol and is abundant in fatty meats, butter, cream, milk and other dairy items. Minimizing your intake of these foods can significantly reduce cholesterol levels. Obesity Side Effects of Eating Fatty Foods Learn More A diet abundant in lipids can lead to obesity, according to \u201cFood Factors for Health Promotion.\u201d Accompanying metabolism abnormalities also are due to daily excess fat intake. Unlike packing on a few extra pounds, obesity is having way too much body fat that can wreak havoc on the body. Even losing 5 percent to 10 percent of your weight can inhibit the onset of certain diseases, according to MedlinePlus. Increased Risk of Disease A high fat diet also increases your risk of diseases like arthritis, some cancers and diabetes, MedlinePlus warns. If you\u2019re obese, you are at a higher risk of type 2 diabetes, which usually accompanies high cholesterol and triglyceride levels, according to MayoClinic.com. Trans fat that comes in the form of partially hydrogenated oils, also lipids, is particularly damaging to your body. It increases low-density lipoprotein, or bad cholesterol, while lowering high-density lipoprotein, or good cholesterol. Recommended Fat Guidelines The Disadvantages of High Saturated Fa",

While diets high in foods rich in fat like meats, cheeses, butter, dairy, and egg yolks are popular, they don't come without some consequences. New research has provided further insight into what happens to the human body when a person eats a fatty meal. Fatty foods can come in many forms ranging from the classic high-fat, unhealthy foods like milkshakes or a burger and fries all the way to adding butter to your morning coffee for the sake of your health. Therefore, it's worth considering what a large amount of dietary fat, especially those that come from animal sources\u2014does to your health. 1. Red blood cell changes. Researchers at the Medical College of Georgia recently conducted a study1 that fed healthy volunteers two meals on different days. Both meals provided 1,000 calories, but one was high in fat and low in carbohydrate, and the other was the opposite. Four hours after the meal, measures of artery function, red blood cell appearance, and the levels of an enzyme called myeloperoxidase or MPO (which is capable of damaging arteries) were all measured. Only the fatty meal caused negative changes in the arteries, blood levels of MPO to skyrocket, and red blood cells to change shape from round discs to a spiky appearance more likely to clump and clot. The impact of the fatty meal on red blood cells and MPO were new findings, and the authors indicated that \"meals enriched in fat may promote destabilization of vulnerable plaques leading to acute myocardial infarction,\" the medical term for a heart attack. 2. Insulin resistance. Researchers in Germany studied2 14 healthy subjects after receiving a meal of palm oil, a tropical oil similar to coconut oil and almost as high in saturated fat. A single meal high in saturated fat reduced insulin sensitivity, an unfavorable result that drove fatty lipids to be stored in the liver. This same finding was seen in a separate study3 of women, and the reduced insulin sensitivity carried over all the w",

What Happens to Your Body When You Eat Too Much Fat, According to Dietitians Fat is an interesting topic. You may not hear many people say that they want more fat, and yet our body needs fat to function. It's one of the three macronutrients, along with protein and carbohydrates, that we need in order to survive.\u00a0Fat contains fatty acids that are called \"essential\" because the body can't make these nutrients and your health will suffer if you don't eat enough fat. On the flip side, eating too much fat can, well, lead to some unwanted consequences. For good health, we need to perform a macronutrient balancing act, say dietitians. \"As an all-foods-fit dietitian, I encourage my clients to eat a balance of fat, carbohydrate, and protein at every meal,\" says registered dietitian Jessica Jones, RD, a nutritional consultant for Premier Protein Cereal. \"Nutrient-dense sources of dietary fat, such as nuts, seeds, fatty fish, and avocado, can have positive effects on overall health.

Study:\u00a0National taxation on sugar-sweetened beverages and its association with overweight, obesity, and diabetes. Image Credit: Brent Hofacker / Shutterstock.com Efforts to reduce SSB consumption The consumption of SSBs or soft drinks has significantly increased throughout the world over the past several decades. This has been associated with rising rates of weight gain, a higher risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, as well as a higher risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality if consumed over the long term. Previously, the Global Burden of Disease study showed that deaths linked to soft drink intake rose between 1990 to 2019. This was accompanied by a rising number of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the number of years lived with disability, the latter of which doubled during this period. In 2009, the American Heart Association (AHA) suggested that added sugars should not exceed 100 and 150 calories each day for females and males, respectively. The World Health Organization (WHO) also limits daily free sugar intake to less than 10% of daily energy intake. Many countries have imposed a tax on SSBs to raise revenue and limit their consumption. Some research shows that when the price of SSBs increases by 20%, their consumption may decline to similar levels. However, this prediction has not been supported by any study on global SSB consumption in relation to national tax policies and population health impact. The current study aimed to summarize national taxation policies on SSBs throughout the world and estimate the impact of tax laws made after 1990 on population-level metabolic parameters like obesity and type 2 diabetes.

To address the growing epidemic of obesity, one option is to combine programmes that target individual behaviour change with a fiscal policy such as excise tax on SSBs. This study evaluates the literature on SSB taxes or price increases, and their potential impact on consumption levels, obesity, overweight and body mass index (BMI). The possibility of switching to alternative drinks is also considered. Methods The following databases were used: Pubmed/Medline, The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Google Scholar, Econlit, National Bureau of Economics Research (NBER), Research Papers in Economics (RePEc). Articles published between January 2000 and January 2013, which reported changes in diet or BMI, overweight and/or obesity due to a tax on, or price change of, SSBs were included. Results Nine articles met the criteria for the meta-analysis. Six were from the USA and one each from Mexico, Brazil and France. All showed negative own-price elasticity, which means that higher prices are associated with a lower demand for SSBs. Pooled own price-elasticity was -1.299 (95% CI: -1.089 - -1.509). Four articles reported cross-price elasticities, three from the USA and one from Mexico; higher prices for SSBs were associated with an increased demand for alternative beverages such as fruit juice (0.388, 95% CI: 0.009 \u2013 0.767) and milk (0.129, 95% CI: -0.085 \u2013 0.342), and a reduced demand for diet drinks (-0.423, 95% CI: -0.628 - -1.219). Six articles from the USA showed that a higher price could also lead to a decrease in BMI, and decrease the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Conclusions Taxing SSBs may reduce obesity.

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

One policy intervention that has gained traction is the implementation of taxes on unhealthy food components like sugar, salt, and fat. These so-called \u201csin taxes\u201d aim to reduce consumption of these ingredients by making products that contain high levels of them more expensive.

However, research suggests that evidence-based policy-making 1/6 doesn't always dictate public response. Researchers have also noted tensions between different types of evidence when establishing the legitimacy of a policy. We study taxes placed on foods that are deemed unhealthy, and find scientific evidence has not dominated the debates over the legitimacy of these measures. Instead, a food tax's chances of survival are based on the ability of political interests to create a successful narrative surrounding the policy's purpose. We compare Denmark, which implemented and quickly repealed a tax on saturated fats in 2011\u201312, and Ireland, which implemented a sugar-sweetened beverage tax in 2018 that has remained in place. A tale of two taxes Our findings demonstrate how certain public health measures are made acceptable to the public. They tell us about the importance of narratives in the successful implementation of similar food taxes in Canada. They also raise questions about when similar narratives may be relevant to other types of public health measures. What shaped public discussion and controversy over food taxes in Denmark and Ireland? In both these countries, the success or failure of the tax depends on two factors. First, how sympathetic were potential \"winners and losers\" under the tax? Second, did previous policies provide a template for the public to understand and potentially accept the tax?

Abstract Objective In France, an excise tax on sugar-sweetened beverages was introduced on 1 January 2012. Our objective was to assess perception of this tax as well as the sociodemographic characteristics of its supporters and opponents. Design Cross-sectional study within the Nutrinet-Sant\u00e9 cohort. A sub-sample of 1996 individuals was selected among participants in the Nutrinet-Sant\u00e9 cohort study. Perceptions of the sugar-sweetened beverage tax were assessed via self-administered questionnaires. The sociodemographic and dietary profiles of supporters and opponents of this tax were explored by multinomial logistic regression. Setting Nationally representative French sample, 2012. Subjects Adults aged >18 years (largest sample n 1996). Results Half of the study sample was generally supportive of the tax and 57\u00b77 % perceived it as helpful in improving population health. Participants were more likely to support the tax model if the revenue it generated would be used for health-care system improvement (72\u00b77 %) and if such taxing was associated with a corresponding decrease in the prices of other foodstuffs (71\u00b75 %). Older participants were more likely to support the tax than were their younger counterparts (OR=2\u00b737; 95 % CI 1\u00b760, 3\u00b749 for >65 years v. 26\u201345 years; P<0\u00b7001).",

Upon the examination of the available evidence as to the effectiveness of fat taxes in reducing obesity authors conclude that all types of fat taxes are not sufficiently specific in targeting obesity. In some cases imposition of fat tax may actually lead to reversal of the intended effect. Therefore, the use of taxes to reduce obesity and promote healthy outcomes is not recommended.

Bridging the Evidence Gap in Obesity Prevention: A Framework to Inform Decision Making. 2Obesity Prevention Strategies in Concept and Practice KEY MESSAGES Obesity has long been viewed as an individual problem, treated primarily by individual or family-based medical and/or psychological methods. As noted in Chapter 1, the expansion of the obesity epidemic to affect diverse age groups, socioeconomic strata, and racial or ethnic groups and communities in the United States and globally has caused a paradigm shift toward preventive strategies that can reach whole communities and populations, as well as a sense of urgency in mounting these strategies (Kumanyika et al., 2002, 2008; Public Health Service, 2001; WHO, 2000). This chapter provides an overview of current thinking and practice regarding obesity prevention strategies. First, definitions and types of obesity prevention are discussed from a population perspective. The logic of obesity prevention when undertaken by different sectors and at different levels is then examined using an overarching model developed by a prior Institute of Medicine (IOM) committee on child obesity prevention. Specific obesity prevention approaches are next ",

Among those are fat taxes which are discriminatory taxes charged on nutrients at risk of excess supply in modern diets. This chapter offers a discussion of the intended and unintended consequences of fat taxes. First, it gives an economic perspective on the causes and effects of obesity. In this light possible regulatory approaches are briefly discussed. The main contribution is the assessment of fat taxes, first listing recent European regulations before reviewing the literature on the effect of fat taxes. Given limited experiences with fat taxes so far, various uncertainties in the ex ante assessment of their effects exist.

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Abstract Taxation on food and non-alcoholic beverages are increasingly employed to promote healthier diets and combat the escalating rates of obesity and diet-related non-communicable diseases. While sugar-sweetened beverages have been the primary focus of such taxes, taxation of high-fat, salt, or sugar (HFSS) foods, and the impact of such taxes are less clear. We conducted a systematic literature review and assessment of the evidence gathered from 20 studies on the impacts of health taxes on HFSS foods around the world. We focused on impacts on sales and consumption of taxed foods, on health outcomes, and on possible unintended consequences (e.g., substitution towards unhealthier products, job losses, ripple effects on businesses, and potential economic burden on lower-income consumers). We found evidence of decreasing sales, or purchases, and intakes of taxed HFSS foods, especially when taxes were combined with subsidies on healthy foods. Higher tax rates were more effective in reducing purchases or consumption",

Powell, Institute for Health Research and Policy and Department of Economics, University of Illinois at Chicago, 1747 West Roosevelt, Room 558, Chicago, IL 60608 (email: powelll@uic.edu). Abstract Context: Pricing policies have been posited as potential policy instruments to address the increasing prevalence of obesity. This article examines whether altering the cost of unhealthy, energy-dense foods, compared with healthy, less-dense foods through the use of fiscal pricing (tax or subsidy) policy instruments would, in fact, change food consumption patterns and overall diet enough to significantly reduce individuals' weight outcomes. Methods: This article examined empirical evidence regarding the food and restaurant price sensitivity of weight outcomes based on a literature search to identify peer-reviewed English-language articles published between 1990 and 2008. Studies were identified from the Medline, PubMed, Econlit, and PAIS databases. The fifteen search combinations used the terms obesity, body mass index, and BMI each in combination with the terms price, prices, tax, taxation, and subsidy. Findings: The studies reviewed showed that when statistically significant associations were found between food and restaurant prices (taxes) and weight outcomes, the effects were generally small in magnitude, although in some cases they were larger for low\u2013socioeconomic status (SES) populations and for those at risk for overweight or obesity.

This primer uses graphical models to highlight the economic implications of these proposals. Concentrating on the intuition of the underlying concepts, the strengths, weaknesses and unintended consequences of these policies are presented within the familiar and accessible partial equilibrium framework. 2 INTRODUCTION Cardiovascular disease is still the leading cause of death in Canada (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2009). Rates of diabetes are increasing and medical obesity afflicts approximately 1 in 5 Canadians (World Health Organization, 2004). Within the decade, nearly half of the U.S. population will be considered obese (Acs and Lyles, 2007). Strong evidence supports the link between diet and health, particularly with respect to the incidence of heart disease, obesity and diabetes (Strnad, 2004). Yet, the precise relationship between food consumption and health outcomes is complex and using policy to solve the food-health equation poses serious challenges for governments. In general, promotion of high nutrient, low calorie foods is viewed positively while the consumption of empty calorie products such as fast food is discouraged. People do not always heed this advice however. Recently, there has been increasing interest in so-called fat taxes and thin subsidies as tools to alter food consumption behaviour (e.g., Taylor, 2009). Lakdawalla and Philipson (2002) claim that approximately half of the increase in weight can be attributed to declining relative food prices, implying that price-based based policies may be effective in altering diet incentives. Designing and applying food policies in pursuit of heath goals is not a trivial undertaking however. Policy-makers and legisla",

        "In this debate, we shall argue that a fat tax, defined as a levy on foods and beverages high in fat, sugar, and/or salt, should be implemented to improve public health outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is the net societal benefit.  We will demonstrate that the benefits of a fat tax, including improved public health outcomes, revenue generation for health initiatives, and positive changes in consumer behavior, outweigh any potential negative consequences.\n\nFirst, a fat tax improves public health by reducing consumption of unhealthy foods and generating revenue for health initiatives.  Hungary's implementation of a similar tax resulted in an 11% reduction in sugar levels in taxed beverages (6). This demonstrates the potential for a fat tax to drive positive dietary changes.  The generated revenue can then be invested in public health programs targeting obesity prevention and education, magnifying the positive impact.  For example, revenue could fund subsidized healthy food programs, further encouraging healthier choices.\n\nSecond, a fat tax encourages positive shifts in consumer behavior.  When faced with increased prices on unhealthy options, consumers are more likely to seek healthier alternatives (4). This shift in consumption patterns contributes to a healthier population in the long term. As consumers adapt to the new pricing structure, they become more conscious of their food choices, fostering a culture of health and wellness.\n\nThird, the negative consequences of a fat tax can be mitigated through careful implementation and targeted support for low-income groups.  Concerns about regressive impacts can be addressed by using the generated revenue to subsidize healthy food options for low-income families (9). This ensures that healthier choices are accessible to all, regardless of income level. Additionally, public awareness campaigns can educate consumers on healthy eating habits and the rationale behind the tax, increasing acceptance and promoting positive behavioral change.\n\nIn conclusion, a fat tax, implemented strategically and thoughtfully, offers a significant net benefit to society by improving public health, encouraging positive consumer behavior changes, and generating revenue for targeted health initiatives.\n\nReference:\n(1)  FasterCapital.

        "\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are the supposed effectiveness of revenue redirection, the assumption of long-term behavior change, and the downplaying of the negative impact on businesses.\n\nFirst, the affirmative argues that a fat tax improves public health and that revenue generated can be used to fund health initiatives, mitigating the regressive impact on low-income families. However, even with revenue redirection, the initial increased cost of food burdens low-income households, restricting their choices and potentially leading to substitutions with cheaper, less healthy options. This financial strain disproportionately affects those already struggling to afford nutritious food, exacerbating existing health disparities. A study published in *The Lancet* (1) demonstrated that during the 2008 financial crisis, families facing economic hardship often substituted nutritious foods with less healthy alternatives due to price increases. This illustrates how a fat tax, even with revenue reallocation, can worsen dietary habits in vulnerable populations.\n\nSecond, the affirmative assumes that a fat tax encourages positive long-term shifts in consumer behavior.  However, this overlooks the fact that short-term reductions in the consumption of taxed items do not necessarily translate to sustained healthy habits.  The Danish fat tax, implemented in 2011 and repealed just 15 months later (2), serves as a prime example. While initial sales of taxed items decreased, consumers often substituted them with equally unhealthy alternatives or crossed borders to purchase preferred foods.  This ultimately resulted in minimal impact on overall saturated fat intake and highlighted the ineffectiveness of the tax in achieving long-term dietary changes.  Therefore, simply taxing specific foods does not guarantee lasting improvements in dietary habits and may even lead to unintended consequences.\n\nThird, the affirmative minimizes the negative impact of a fat tax on businesses by suggesting that industry adaptation will mitigate these effects. This ignores the considerable costs and logistical challenges faced by businesses in reformulating products, as well as the potential job losses within affected industries.  A 2024 review in *Food Policy* (3) analyzed 20 studies and found that fat taxes consistently resulted in decreased sales of taxed products, impacting industry revenue. This economic burden can be significant, particularly for small businesses that operate on tighter margins and have less capacity to absorb such losses. The Danish fat tax, for instance, led to cross-border shopping and increased administrative burdens for businesses (4), ultimately contributing to its repeal.  The focus on penalizing specific foods, rather than promoting holistic health solutions, misdirects efforts and can have detrimental consequences for the food industry.\n\nReference:\n(1) \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n(2) The Conversation.

        "\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the effectiveness and fairness of a fat tax.\n\nWhile the proposition emphasizes the potential public health benefits and revenue generation, they fail to address the fundamental flaws in this approach.  Their argument hinges on the idea that revenue redirection will mitigate the regressive impact on low-income families. However, this ignores the immediate burden of increased food prices.  Imagine a single mother already struggling to feed her children.  A fat tax, even with eventual subsidies, means she has to choose between less food or less nutritious food *today*.  This immediate impact, before any long-term benefits materialize, exacerbates existing inequalities and undermines the very goal of promoting public health.  Even with subsidies, access to healthy options remains unequal due to factors like food deserts and ingrained cultural preferences.\n\nFurthermore, the proposition\u2019s reliance on the idea that a fat tax encourages long-term behavior change is unsupported by evidence.  The Danish fat tax, a real-world example, demonstrates that consumers often substitute taxed items with equally unhealthy alternatives or simply adjust their spending elsewhere.  This highlights the complexity of behavior change, where price is just one factor among many.  Simply making unhealthy foods more expensive doesn\u2019t magically transform eating habits.  True change requires a holistic approach that empowers individuals through education, access to healthy options, and support for positive lifestyle choices.\n\nFinally, we must consider the value of individual autonomy.  A fat tax, in essence, dictates what people can and cannot eat, infringing on their freedom of choice.  Instead of punishing people for their food choices, we should focus on empowering them with the knowledge and resources they need to make informed decisions.  This respects individual liberty and fosters a more sustainable approach to public health.\n\nReferences:\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

        "Good morning, everyone. Let\u2019s talk about something that affects us all: food.  More specifically, the idea of a \u201cfat tax\u201d \u2013 a tax on foods high in sugar, fat, or salt.  Now, while the intention might seem good \u2013 encouraging healthier eating \u2013 we believe this approach is ultimately flawed and will do more harm than good. We\u2019re here to argue against imposing a fat tax.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s talk about fairness. Think about your weekly grocery bill.  Now imagine if everything from a can of soda to a bag of chips suddenly became more expensive.  For many of us, that would be a noticeable pinch. But for families already struggling to make ends meet, it could be devastating.  *This isn\u2019t just a hypothetical scenario.*  A study in *The Lancet* showed that fat taxes hit low-income households the hardest (1).  They spend a larger portion of their income on food, so these taxes take a bigger bite out of their budgets. Remember the proposed soda tax in New York? It faced huge backlash because people recognized it would unfairly burden the poorest residents.  Simply redirecting the tax revenue to health programs doesn't solve the core problem \u2013 it\u2019s still taking more from those who can least afford it. We need solutions that promote healthy eating *without* punishing the poor.\n\nSecond, let\u2019s consider whether these taxes actually work.  Think about it \u2013 if the price of your favorite snack doubles, will you really stop eating it altogether?  You might buy less, sure, but you might also just switch to a slightly cheaper, equally unhealthy option. Or maybe you cut back on something else entirely, like fresh fruits and vegetables.  *Research backs this up.*  Several studies, including a comprehensive systematic review, have shown that people often find ways around these taxes (2, 3, 4). They substitute one unhealthy item for another, or they simply adjust their spending in other areas.  Remember the Danish saturated fat tax?  They tried it, and it barely made a dent in overall saturated fat intake. People just changed their shopping habits.  The tax was eventually repealed.  This shows us that simply taxing specific foods is unlikely to change overall consumption patterns.  While some suggest reinvesting the tax revenue, this avoids the real issue \u2013 people aren\u2019t necessarily eating healthier, and low-income families are still bearing the brunt of the cost.\n\nThird, let\u2019s look at the impact on businesses. Imagine you own a small grocery store.  Suddenly, demand for certain products drops because of a new tax.  That\u2019s lost revenue, and it can have a real impact on your livelihood.  A 2024 review in *Food Policy* analyzed 20 studies and found clear evidence of decreased sales and consumption of taxed foods, directly affecting industry revenues (5, 6).  The Danish fat tax, for example, led to more people crossing the border to shop and created huge administrative headaches for businesses.  It was repealed after just 15 months.  This illustrates the negative ripple effect these taxes can have.  While businesses might try to adapt by changing their products, that takes time and money, and it might not make up for the lost sales (7).  Plus, focusing on penalizing certain foods distracts us from the bigger picture \u2013 we need to educate people about healthy eating and make healthy options accessible to everyone.\n\nSo, let\u2019s recap.  Fat taxes disproportionately affect low-income families, they don\u2019t effectively reduce consumption, and they harm the food industry.  Instead of punishing people for their food choices, let\u2019s focus on real solutions.  We need to educate people about nutrition, improve access to healthy, affordable food, and encourage positive lifestyle changes.  Let\u2019s reject this fat tax and work together to build a healthier future for everyone.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

        "Friends, neighbors, fellow citizens, let's talk about something that affects us all: our health.  My opponents raise some concerns about a fat tax, and I want to address them head-on.\n\nFirst, they worry about the impact on vulnerable populations. They argue that increasing food costs will force lower-income families to choose cheaper, less healthy options.  Think about your own grocery bill lately \u2013 we all feel the pinch.  But here's the key: *this tax isn't about taking money away; it's about redirecting it*.  Imagine the revenue generated being used to make healthy foods more affordable for everyone.  That's like a discount at the grocery store, specifically for fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. This not only eases the burden on families but also encourages healthier eating habits.  It's a win-win.\n\nSecond, they bring up the Danish fat tax, claiming it didn't work. They say people just bought unhealthy foods elsewhere or switched to different, equally unhealthy options.  But let's be clear: the Danish tax was flawed. It was a small tax, applied inconsistently, and didn't offer healthier alternatives.  It's like trying to fix a leaky roof with a band-aid.  A well-designed fat tax, with a broader scope and paired with incentives for healthy choices, is more likely to create lasting change.  The Danish example isn't a failure of the concept; it's a lesson in *how to do it right*.\n\nThird, they express concern about the impact on businesses. They talk about reformulation costs and potential job losses.  But businesses adapt all the time.  Think about how companies have innovated to meet changing consumer demands in the past. A fat tax would encourage the food industry to develop and market healthier products, creating new opportunities for growth.  Plus, the revenue generated could help businesses transition to healthier product lines, protecting jobs and fostering innovation.  This isn't about punishing businesses; it's about *working together* to create a healthier marketplace.\n\nFourth, they argue that focusing on specific foods is a misdirection of efforts. They again point to the Danish example, highlighting unintended consequences like cross-border shopping.  While the Danish tax had shortcomings, this doesn't negate the potential benefits of a well-designed tax.  Focusing on foods high in sugar, fat, and salt \u2013 the ones linked to chronic diseases \u2013 allows for targeted interventions.  Think about it: if we can reduce consumption of these specific foods, we can make a real difference in public health.  The Danish experience teaches us to be mindful of unintended consequences and design policies that minimize them.  It doesn't invalidate the strategy of using taxation to influence consumer behavior and improve public health.\n\nFinally, let's address the concern about the regressive nature of fat taxes. The goal isn't to punish low-income individuals.  The aim is to incentivize healthier choices and generate revenue for programs that benefit everyone.  This includes subsidizing healthy food options, funding educational campaigns, and supporting community health initiatives.  Studies by the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA, 2018) and The Lancet (2009) highlight the importance of addressing the regressive nature of fat taxes.  These studies don't negate the potential public health benefits; they emphasize the need for careful policy design and targeted interventions to mitigate the impact on low-income households.  Education and awareness campaigns can also play a crucial role in promoting healthy eating habits.  By empowering individuals with knowledge and resources, we can create a more equitable and sustainable approach to improving public health.  This is about *investing in our collective well-being*.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2.

        "Friends, let\u2019s talk plainly about something that affects us all: *our health and our wallets*.  Does a fat tax really make us healthier, or is it just another burden, especially for those already struggling? We believe it\u2019s the latter.\n\nOur opponents say the tax revenue will help, but how does that help families *right now* when they have to choose between less food and less healthy food?  Think about your own grocery bill \u2013 how would an extra tax affect your choices? This immediate impact undermines the very idea of improving public health.\n\nThey also talk about changing long-term habits. But look at what happened in Denmark.  Did the fat tax there change habits? No. People just bought different, sometimes *less* healthy things, or shopped across the border.  According to a study published in *Health Economics*, the Danish fat tax led to a significant increase in cross-border shopping for groceries. This shows we need real solutions, not just higher prices. Our opponents haven\u2019t addressed this at all.\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: a fat tax hits low-income families hardest. They spend a bigger part of their income on food. This fact remains unchallenged.  What about the impact on our local food businesses?  Fewer sales, job losses, the cost of changing recipes \u2013 these are real consequences.  A report by the *Institute for Fiscal Studies* highlighted the potential negative impact of a fat tax on the food industry, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nInstead of punishing people with a fat tax, let\u2019s empower them.  Give them the information and the access to healthy, affordable food they need.  This respects our freedom to choose while creating real, lasting change.  A fat tax restricts choice, burdens the vulnerable, and doesn\u2019t guarantee better health. Let\u2019s reject this flawed approach and choose a path that truly supports health and well-being for everyone.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n\n1. \"Fat taxes\" and the financial crisis - The Lancet: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)60463-3/fulltext\n2. \"The Proof of the Pudding: Denmark's fat tax fiasco\": https://iea.org.uk/publications/research/the-proof-of-the-pudding-denmark\u2019s-fat-tax-fiasco\n\n"
