      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice.  Online public opinion trials are defined as situations where legal cases or controversies are extensively discussed and debated in online public forums, potentially influencing legal proceedings or outcomes. This includes social media discussions, online petitions, and citizen journalism efforts related to legal matters. Justice is a state of affairs in which fairness, equity, and the rule of law prevail, ensuring that individuals receive due process, appropriate punishments or remedies, and protection from harm.  \"Closer to Justice\" means progress towards a more just outcome, increasing fairness, equity, and adherence to the rule of law in legal processes and outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. The side that best demonstrates a net positive impact on society's pursuit of justice, considering factors like fairness, accuracy, accountability, access to justice, and protection of individual rights, should win.  This framework is appropriate because the motion is fundamentally about whether online public opinion trials improve or hinder the overall effectiveness and fairness of the justice system.\n\nFirst, online public opinion trials enhance transparency and accountability within the legal system.  Increased public scrutiny through online platforms holds legal actors accountable, exposes misconduct, and promotes fairness. For example, in 2021, public outcry on social media following the police killing of Elijah McClain contributed to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [1].  Studies show that public pressure resulting from online scrutiny can lead to police reforms and investigations into misconduct [2]. This transparency and accountability are crucial for a just legal system, as highlighted by research on the role of transparency in good governance [3].\n\nSecond, online platforms amplify marginalized voices and facilitate access to justice. Traditional legal processes can be inaccessible or biased against certain groups.  Online platforms provide avenues for marginalized communities to share their experiences, organize legal support, and advocate for their rights.  Research indicates that online campaigns have played a key role in legal reforms benefiting marginalized groups, such as the #MeToo movement raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault [4]. This increased access to justice and amplified voice for the marginalized contributes to a more equitable legal system.\n\nThird, online public opinion trials facilitate information sharing and public education about legal issues, improving public understanding and engagement with the justice system. Open online discussions about legal cases can educate the public about legal principles, processes, and potential biases, fostering informed participation in legal and political discourse.  For instance, online discussions surrounding high-profile court cases often involve explanations of complex legal concepts, making them more accessible to the general public. This increased awareness ultimately strengthens the pursuit of justice.  A study by [5] demonstrated that online discussions of hypothetical legal problems led to deeper analysis and critical thinking among participants.\n\nIn conclusion, by fostering transparency and accountability, amplifying marginalized voices, and promoting public education, online public opinion trials ultimately contribute to a more just and equitable legal system, bringing us closer to, not further from, justice.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Change.org.

      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice. While the proposition paints a rosy picture of increased transparency and amplified voices, we argue that these supposed benefits are overshadowed by the inherent dangers of online trials, which ultimately obstruct the path to true justice.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \u201conline public opinion trials.\u201d We define them as instances where individuals are subjected to public judgment and condemnation online, often based on incomplete information and fueled by emotional responses, before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.  Our judging criteria today should be minimizing harm.  The side that best demonstrates how their interpretation of online public opinion trials minimizes harm to individuals and the integrity of the legal system should win this debate.  This framework is crucial because justice is not simply about speed or perceived public satisfaction; it's about ensuring fairness, due process, and protecting individual rights.\n\nNow, let me turn to our first point: online public opinion trials readily devolve into vigilantism. Consider this: you are accused of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, and before you even step into a courtroom, your reputation is tarnished, your life threatened, all based on incomplete information circulating online. Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism [1] notes public shaming as a common tactic, highlighting how online platforms are weaponized to enact extrajudicial \u201cjustice.\u201d  This bypasses due process, fostering mob rule and undermining the legal system. The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment, creating a climate of fear and intimidation rather than justice.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices. Studies like \"Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement\" [2] show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers that reinforce existing biases. These platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly and influence public perception, thus moving us further from impartial justice. Imagine a scenario where you\u2019re judged not on the facts of a case, but on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth. That is the reality of online public opinion trials.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the crucial issue here is that online public opinion trials disproportionately affect marginalized communities.  They face a double disadvantage. First, as revealed in \"Challenges to Continuity During the COVID-19 Pandemic - PMC\" [3], many lack access to technology or the skills to navigate online spaces, limiting their ability to participate and counter misinformation. Second, \"Introduction: Marginality and Social Media\" [4] explains how existing power imbalances are amplified online, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation and online harassment. As you'll see, this combination of exclusion and amplified vulnerability exacerbates existing marginalization and undermines fair representation, moving us further from a just society.  \n\nIn conclusion, while the allure of online public opinion trials might seem appealing on the surface, we believe that their inherent dangers\u2014vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate harm to marginalized communities\u2014pose a significant threat to the very foundations of our justice system.  We urge you to consider the real-world consequences of these trials and stand with us in opposition.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1]  Wikipedia. *Internet vigilantism*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism\n[2]  Yogeeswaran, Kumar, and Joel S.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement mischaracterizes online public opinion trials, offering a narrow definition, a restrictive judging criterion, and a pessimistic outlook on their potential for good. We, the affirmative team, contend that online public opinion trials, broadly defined, contribute significantly to the pursuit of justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the negative team\u2019s narrow definition of online public opinion trials as mere online judgment and condemnation ignores the multifaceted nature of online discourse related to legal issues.  Our broader definition, encompassing discussions, analyses, and information sharing, is more appropriate because it reflects the reality of how people engage with legal matters online.  Platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and the Electronic Case Filings websites of various courts [2] exemplify this, providing accessible legal information and promoting transparency, thereby fostering a more informed citizenry crucial for a just society. By excluding these vital functions, the negative\u2019s definition weakens their argument. Our broader definition, encompassing the educational and informative aspects of online engagement, strengthens our case by demonstrating how these platforms enhance public understanding of the legal system, a cornerstone of achieving justice.\n\nSecond, the negative team\u2019s focus on \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criterion is overly cautious and insufficient for evaluating the complex impact of online public opinion trials.  Maximizing societal benefit, our proposed criterion, is superior because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.  This holistic approach aligns with the core principles of justice, which seek not just to avoid harm, but also to actively promote fairness and equity.  A study in the Journal of Information Policy [3] highlights how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable, directly contributing to a more just society.  By focusing solely on minimizing harm, the negative team neglects the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice, thus weakening their argument and strengthening ours.\n\nThird, the negative team\u2019s claim that online public opinion trials inevitably lead to vigilantism is an unfounded generalization.  While acknowledging potential risks, we argue that vigilantism is not an inherent outcome of online discussions. Many platforms actively moderate content [4], and research suggests that online discussions often center on raising awareness, supporting victims, and advocating for legal reforms [5].  These positive contributions are crucial for achieving justice and are entirely disregarded by the negative team.  Their focus on a potential negative outcome, while ignoring the demonstrable positive impacts, weakens their argument and strengthens our position that online platforms can be powerful tools for positive change.\n\nFourth, the negative team's argument that online platforms amplify biases, while true, overlooks their unique capacity to *mitigate* bias by providing diverse perspectives and amplifying marginalized voices. While traditional media can also amplify bias, as discussed in [6], online platforms offer a unique opportunity for counter-speech and the dissemination of alternative viewpoints [7]. This ability to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more inclusive public discourse is crucial for achieving a just society. By focusing solely on the potential for bias amplification, the negative team ignores the unique potential of online platforms to promote balanced and informed public discourse\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Cornell Law School.

      "content": "Friends, judges, and esteemed audience, the affirmative team\u2019s arguments, while superficially appealing, fail to address the fundamental flaws of online public opinion trials. Their attempts to redefine the motion, shift the judging criteria, and downplay the inherent risks only serve to highlight the weakness of their position.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address their broad definition of online public opinion trials. While resources like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and Electronic Case Filings websites [2] undoubtedly offer valuable legal information, they are distinct from the often-toxic environment of online public opinion trials.  These trials, as we defined, involve public judgment and condemnation, often based on incomplete information.  This distinction is crucial.  While legal information platforms promote informed citizenry, online trials frequently devolve into biased, emotionally-charged judgments.  This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment ([3], [4]) and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities ([5], [6]).\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider their proposed judging criteria of \"maximizing societal benefit.\"  While a laudable goal, it's dangerously incomplete.  Focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm. Studies document the spread of misinformation [7] and negative public opinion outbreaks [8] resulting from online trials.  These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote. A balanced approach, prioritizing minimizing harm, is crucial. Imagine being subjected to a trial by social media, your reputation tarnished before due process, based on misinformation amplified by algorithms. Where is the societal benefit in that?\n\nThe affirmative\u2019s claim that vigilantism isn\u2019t an inherent outcome of online discussions is simply wishful thinking.  While content moderation exists, the very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms enable rapid dissemination of accusations, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process ( [9]). This often spills into offline harassment and violence, documented in cases where online and offline bullying co-occur ([10], [3]).  While some online discussions might raise awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics ( [9]).  Think about how quickly misinformation spreads online, how easily individuals can be targeted and harassed.  This is not justice; it's a dangerous erosion of due process.\n\nFinally, their argument about mitigating bias ignores the reality of echo chambers.  Prejudiced individuals seek confirming information online ( [11]). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate [12].  Individuals are judged based on amplified pre-existing biases [13], hindering impartial justice.  Their claim of diverse perspectives is often drowned out by the cacophony of biased information amplified by algorithms designed for engagement, not truth.\n\nFurthermore, let's address the critical issue of due process.  Social media's rapid information dissemination leads to premature judgments, impacting due process integrity ( [14]). This instantaneous nature bypasses the structured, evidence-based legal process, creating a \"trial by social media\" environment ([15]). This undermines the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial ([16]), jeopardizing impartiality.  Consider the potential consequences: your life upended by online accusations before you have a chance to defend yourself in a court of law. This is not justice; this is a dangerous perversion of it.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Cornell Law School. *Legal Information Institute*. www.law.cornell.edu/lii/\n[2] Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. pacer.gov\n[3]  Hinduja, Sameer, and Justin W.

Yet, audience selectivity\u2014inherent within today\u2019s high-choice media environments\u2014has largely been disregarded. Relatedly, the predominance of forced-exposure designs is a source of concern. This article proposes the integration of audience selectivity into media stereotype effects research. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u20091,166) indicated that prejudiced individuals tended to approach prejudice-consistent stereotypical news and avoid prejudice-challenging counter-stereotypical news. Using a forced-exposure experiment, study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009380) showed detrimental effects of prejudice-consistent news and beneficial effects of prejudice-challenging news. Relying on a self-selected exposure paradigm, study 3 (N\u2009=\u20091,149) provided evidence for preference-based reinforcement. Study 4\u2019s \u201cnet-effect perspective\u201d (N\u2009=\u2009937) indicated that operationalizing exposure as forced or self-selected can lead to different interpretations of actual societal effects. The findings emphasize the key role played by audience selectivity when studying media effects. The media portray many social categories, such as minority groups, in a stereotypical way (Billings & Parrott, 2020). This is problematic, as media depictions often represent the main, if not the only, source of information for citizens (Ramasubramanian & Murphy, 2014). Previous research has already acknowledged the importance of studying the effects of exposure to media stereotypes on essential outcomes, such as prejudice. This l",

We review online activism and its relations with offline collective action. Social media facilitate online activism, particularly by documenting and collating individual experiences, community building, norm formation, and development of shared realities. In theory, online activism could hinder offline protests, but empirical evidence for slacktivism is mixed. In some contexts, online and offline action could be unrelated because people act differently online versus offline, or because people restrict their actions to one do",

The study demonstrates how prejudiced individuals selectively consume information confirming their views while avoiding contradictory perspectives. This creates a feedback loop where exposure to biased information strengthens pre-existing prejudices. Moreover, the study found that presenting both biased and counter-biased information under forced-exposure conditions had differing effects than allowing individuals to self-select information. This suggests that in online environments, where self-selection is the norm, the potential for bias amplification is significant. Although the study focuses on news consumption, its findings are applicable to online public opinion trials, where individuals actively seek information validating their opinions. While some may argue that online platforms offer diverse perspectives, Arendt's research demonstrates how individual biases, combined with algorithmic amplification, create echo chambers that ultimately hinder impartial justice.  This dynamic pushes us further from, rather than closer to, justice.",

Yet, audience selectivity\u2014inherent within today\u2019s high-choice media environments\u2014has largely been disregarded. Relatedly, the predominance of forced-exposure designs is a source of concern. This article proposes the integration of audience selectivity into media stereotype effects research. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u20091,166) indicated that prejudiced individuals tended to approach prejudice-consistent stereotypical news and avoid prejudice-challenging counter-stereotypical news. Using a forced-exposure experiment, study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009380) showed detrimental effects of prejudice-consistent news and beneficial effects of prejudice-challenging news. Relying on a self-selected exposure paradigm, study 3 (N\u2009=\u20091,149) provided evidence for preference-based reinforcement. Study 4\u2019s \u201cnet-effect perspective\u201d (N\u2009=\u2009937) indicated that operationalizing exposure as forced or self-selected can lead to different interpretations of actual societal effects. The findings emphasize the key role played by audience selectivity when studying media effects. The media portray many social categories, such as minority groups, in a stereotypical way (Billings & Parrott, 2020). This is problematic, as media depictions often represent the main, if not the only, source of information for citizens (Ramasubramanian & Murphy, 2014). Previous research has already acknowledged the importance of studying the effects of exposure to media stereotypes on essential outcomes, such as prejudice. This l",

This exclusion not only silences their voices but also allows dominant narratives to prevail unchecked, potentially leading to misrepresentation and skewed public opinion. This study, published in a reputable medical journal, highlights the pre-existing marginalization faced by these communities which is further compounded by the digital divide. This lack of representation in the online sphere has profound consequences, influencing public perception and potentially leading to unjust outcomes. While some might argue that online platforms offer opportunities for marginalized communities to voice their concerns, the evidence shows that the digital divide creates a significant barrier to access, preventing equitable participation and reinforcing existing power imbalances.

The digital world offers a useful medium for female empowerment and community building, amplifying the voices of marginalized populations globally. However, social media and online spaces can also be used to exacerbate gender-based online harassment and proliferate structural gender-based violence through disinformation, cyberharassment, cyberstalking, sextortion, recruitment for sex trafficking, revenge porn and threats of physical assault. The perpetrator-victim dynamic changes drastically in an online context, permitting perpetrators to hide behind the anonymity of the internet. Online violence is pervasive and has profound implications for the ability of women, girls and other marginalized individuals to exist safely in digital spaces. Marginalized groups \u2014 including women, gender minoritized groups, LGBTQ+ persons and people with disabilities \u2014 are the most vulnerable to coordinated violence in an online context. Gender-based online abuse is far more prevalent in regions with diminished social and political protections for women and girls. The lessened social status of victims of gender-based online harassment means that there is often little legal or protective recourse for them. According to the United Nations, approximately 40% of all solicitation and recruitment for sex trafficking begins on social media, which markedly increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. Through social media platforms and online chat platforms, predatory actors can more easily solicit in-person interaction with young",

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice. While the proposition paints a rosy picture of increased transparency and amplified voices, we argue that these supposed benefits are overshadowed by the inherent dangers of online trials, which ultimately obstruct the path to true justice.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \u201conline public opinion trials.\u201d We define them as instances where individuals are subjected to public judgment and condemnation online, often based on incomplete information and fueled by emotional responses, before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.  Our judging criteria today should be minimizing harm.  The side that best demonstrates how their interpretation of online public opinion trials minimizes harm to individuals and the integrity of the legal system should win this debate.  This framework is crucial because justice is not simply about speed or perceived public satisfaction; it's about ensuring fairness, due process, and protecting individual rights.\n\nNow, let me turn to our first point: online public opinion trials readily devolve into vigilantism. Consider this: you are accused of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, and before you even step into a courtroom, your reputation is tarnished, your life threatened, all based on incomplete information circulating online. Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism [1] notes public shaming as a common tactic, highlighting how online platforms are weaponized to enact extrajudicial \u201cjustice.\u201d  This bypasses due process, fostering mob rule and undermining the legal system. The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment, creating a climate of fear and intimidation rather than justice.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices. Studies like \"Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement\" [2] show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers that reinforce existing biases. These platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly and influence public perception, thus moving us further from impartial justice. Imagine a scenario where you\u2019re judged not on the facts of a case, but on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth. That is the reality of online public opinion trials.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the crucial issue here is that online public opinion trials disproportionately affect marginalized communities.  They face a double disadvantage. First, as revealed in \"Challenges to Continuity During the COVID-19 Pandemic - PMC\" [3], many lack access to technology or the skills to navigate online spaces, limiting their ability to participate and counter misinformation. Second, \"Introduction: Marginality and Social Media\" [4] explains how existing power imbalances are amplified online, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation and online harassment. As you'll see, this combination of exclusion and amplified vulnerability exacerbates existing marginalization and undermines fair representation, moving us further from a just society.  \n\nIn conclusion, while the allure of online public opinion trials might seem appealing on the surface, we believe that their inherent dangers\u2014vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate harm to marginalized communities\u2014pose a significant threat to the very foundations of our justice system.  We urge you to consider the real-world consequences of these trials and stand with us in opposition.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1]  Wikipedia. *Internet vigilantism*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism\n[2]  Yogeeswaran, Kumar, and Joel S.

        "statements": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement mischaracterizes online public opinion trials, offering a narrow definition, a restrictive judging criterion, and a pessimistic outlook on their potential for good. We, the affirmative team, contend that online public opinion trials, broadly defined, contribute significantly to the pursuit of justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the negative team\u2019s narrow definition of online public opinion trials as mere online judgment and condemnation ignores the multifaceted nature of online discourse related to legal issues.  Our broader definition, encompassing discussions, analyses, and information sharing, is more appropriate because it reflects the reality of how people engage with legal matters online.  Platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and the Electronic Case Filings websites of various courts [2] exemplify this, providing accessible legal information and promoting transparency, thereby fostering a more informed citizenry crucial for a just society. By excluding these vital functions, the negative\u2019s definition weakens their argument. Our broader definition, encompassing the educational and informative aspects of online engagement, strengthens our case by demonstrating how these platforms enhance public understanding of the legal system, a cornerstone of achieving justice.\n\nSecond, the negative team\u2019s focus on \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criterion is overly cautious and insufficient for evaluating the complex impact of online public opinion trials.  Maximizing societal benefit, our proposed criterion, is superior because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.  This holistic approach aligns with the core principles of justice, which seek not just to avoid harm, but also to actively promote fairness and equity.  A study in the Journal of Information Policy [3] highlights how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable, directly contributing to a more just society.  By focusing solely on minimizing harm, the negative team neglects the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice, thus weakening their argument and strengthening ours.\n\nThird, the negative team\u2019s claim that online public opinion trials inevitably lead to vigilantism is an unfounded generalization.  While acknowledging potential risks, we argue that vigilantism is not an inherent outcome of online discussions. Many platforms actively moderate content [4], and research suggests that online discussions often center on raising awareness, supporting victims, and advocating for legal reforms [5].  These positive contributions are crucial for achieving justice and are entirely disregarded by the negative team.  Their focus on a potential negative outcome, while ignoring the demonstrable positive impacts, weakens their argument and strengthens our position that online platforms can be powerful tools for positive change.\n\nFourth, the negative team's argument that online platforms amplify biases, while true, overlooks their unique capacity to *mitigate* bias by providing diverse perspectives and amplifying marginalized voices. While traditional media can also amplify bias, as discussed in [6], online platforms offer a unique opportunity for counter-speech and the dissemination of alternative viewpoints [7]. This ability to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more inclusive public discourse is crucial for achieving a just society. By focusing solely on the potential for bias amplification, the negative team ignores the unique potential of online platforms to promote balanced and informed public discourse\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Cornell Law School.

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles \u2013 either online, in the real world, or both. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Societal Implications of Cancel Culture The Rise of Cancel Culture: Social, Cultural, and Technological Factors Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there\u2019s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals\u2019 actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These plat",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

Those forecasting improvement place their hopes in technological fixes and in societal solutions. Others think the dark side of human nature is aided more than stifled by technology. In late 2016, Oxford Dictionaries selected \u201cpost-truth\u201d as the word of the year, defining it as \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d The 2016 Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the tumultuous U.S. presidential election highlighted how the digital age has affected news and cultural narratives.

Fact-checks on information often fall behind the diffusion of misinformation, which can lead to negative impacts on society. This research studies how different factors may affect the spread of fact-checks over the internet. We collected a dataset of fact-checks in a six-month period and analyzed how they spread on Twitter. The spread of fact-checks is measured by the total retweet count. The factors/variables include the truthfulness rating, topic of information, source credibility, etc. The research identifies truthfulness rating as a significant factor: conclusive fact-checks (either true or false) tend to be shared more than others. In addition, the source credibility, political leaning, and the sharing count also affect the spread of fact-checks. The findings of this research provide practical insights into accelerating the spread of the truth in the battle against misinformation online.

While platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute are valuable, conflating them with trials driven by public sentiment disregards the distinct dangers of the latter. This approach prioritizes potentially skewed public opinion over legal processes, failing to maximize societal benefit and potentially leading to harmful consequences, especially for marginalized groups.",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

In late 2016, Oxford Dictionaries selected \u201cpost-truth\u201d as the word of the year, defining it as \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d The 2016 Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the tumultuous U.S. presidential election highlighted how the digital age has affected news and cultural narratives. New information platforms feed the ancient instinct people have to find information that syncs with their perspectives: A 2016 study that analyzed 376 million Facebook users\u2019 interactions with over 900 news outlets found that people tend to seek information that aligns with their views. This makes many vulnerable to accepting and acting on misinformation.

The popularization and application of the Internet has brought great convenience to the people, promoted the communication and interaction between the government and the people, and added new ways of expressing public opinion; the Internet is highly developed, and the government makes full use of its role to collect social opinions through Internet. Public opinion promotes the democratization and scientific rationality of public policies. This article will discuss the following aspects: first, focus on the influence of online public opinion on public policy, explain the research background of the article, analyze and organize it; second, consult relevant literature, sort out the related concepts of online public opinion and public policy and characteristics; third, analyze the value of online public opinion on public policies, including positive and negative effects, based on cases, data, and referenced literature; finally, put forward targeted suggestions and countermeasures for existing problems, including improvement. The government plays an important role in the construction of network infrastructure and strengthening the moral education of netizens. It is necessary to do a good job in guiding the network public opinion, devote itself to creating a good and healthy network atmosphere, and attach importance to the dual influence of network public opinion on public policies, to make it fully play its positive role.

This study adds the influence of network media and government media on susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model and considers the interaction between different emotions to construct the susceptible-exposed-positive-emotional-infectious-and-negative-emotional-infectious-immune-removed (SEI2R1R2) online public opinion dissemination model under such dual intervention of network media and government media. The opinion propagation model is simulated in Python and the model is validated by mining text sentiment using text convolutional neural networks (CNN) to fit relevant parameters. Results show that the SEI2R1R2 online public opinion dissemination model is more consistent with reality. With the role of media from different",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

While the digital age helps facilitate spaces for women to be heard with movements and campaigns such as #OrangeTheWorld #MeToo #TimesUp #NotOneMore, conversely, it also presents further opportunities to inflict harm on women.\u00a0 Kicking off 25 November, the annual\u00a0International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women will feature 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence\u2019 campaign. What is online violence? Dr Emma A. Jane, a UNSW Senior Lecturer in the School of the Arts & Media, says online violence can refer to a range of dialogues and acts that occur at the gender, technology and violence nexus. \u201cExamples of online violence include hate speech, sexually violent dialogue, plausible rape and death threats, stalking, large groups attacking individuals, the malicious circulation of targets\u2019 personal details online (known as \u2018doxing\u2019), and the uploading of sexually explicit material without the consent of the pictured subject (\u2018revenge porn\u2019),\u201d\u00a0Dr Jane says.

The article cites examples of individuals being targeted for actions deemed socially deviant, illustrating how online platforms facilitate rapid dissemination of accusations and judgments, often with little regard for due process.  This creates a climate ripe for vigilantism, as individuals take justice into their own hands, fueled by public outrage amplified by social media algorithms.  Furthermore, studies demonstrate the overlap between online and offline harassment and violence (5_5, 5_7).  This shows the real-world consequences of online shaming, moving beyond mere online condemnation to tangible harm. While some may argue online platforms allow for content moderation, the sheer volume and speed of online discourse makes effective control challenging, leaving individuals vulnerable to mob justice.  The potential for misjudgment and disproportionate punishment is high, particularly when emotions run high in online environments.",

These modern-day guardians of the digital realm are neither caped crusaders nor masked avengers, but they do wield a power that challenges traditional notions of justice. Welcome to the world of cyber vigilantism, where the line between hero and villain blurs in the name of online righteousness. At the forefront of studying this phenomenon is Dr. Leanna Ireland, PhD, assistant professor of criminal justice in the Department of Economics, Justice and Policy Studies at Mount Royal University. With a keen interest in vigilantism in the online world, Ireland is shedding light on new forms of activism, social movements and justice-seeking behaviour. The rise of cyber vigilantism Vigilantism \u2014 where people take justice into their own hands \u2014 has a long history, dating back to ancient times. The internet has moved the practice forward by allowing millions of people to engage in a single act of vigilantism all at once. Despite new technology, motives such as frustration over the inaction of authorities have remained largely unchanged over time. Today, some self-appointed crimefighters target serious criminal offences such as child exploitation. For example, one of the top results for \u201cped(ophile) hunter\u201d on TikTok is an account with more than 183,000 followers. Others take on socially deviant cases. An early example comes from 2005 in which a young woman refused to clean up after her dog did its business in a subway car in South Korea. A fellow commuter posted pictures on social media and the incident turned into a viral sensation, sparking outrage online. \u201cUndoubtedly, acts of cyber vigilantism are becoming more commonplace with the proliferation of digital tools,\u201d Ireland says. \u201cMore people \u2014 regardless of their technical skills \u2014 can now engage in cyber vigilantism efforts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to create an X or TikTok account and shame someone for their actions and, or, release their pe",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

Yet, audience selectivity\u2014inherent within today\u2019s high-choice media environments\u2014has largely been disregarded. Relatedly, the predominance of forced-exposure designs is a source of concern. This article proposes the integration of audience selectivity into media stereotype effects research. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u20091,166) indicated that prejudiced individuals tended to approach prejudice-consistent stereotypical news and avoid prejudice-challenging counter-stereotypical news. Using a forced-exposure experiment, study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009380) showed detrimental effects of prejudice-consistent news and beneficial effects of prejudice-challenging news. Relying on a self-selected exposure paradigm, study 3 (N\u2009=\u20091,149) provided evidence for preference-based reinforcement. Study 4\u2019s \u201cnet-effect perspective\u201d (N\u2009=\u2009937) indicated that operationalizing exposure as forced or self-selected can lead to different interpretations of actual societal effects. The findings emphasize the key role played by audience selectivity when studying media effects. The media portray many social categories, such as minority groups, in a stereotypical way (Billings & Parrott, 2020). This is problematic, as media depictions often represent the main, if not the only, source of information for citizens (Ramasubramanian & Murphy, 2014). Previous research has already acknowledged the importance of studying the effects of exposure to media stereotypes on essential outcomes, such as prejudice. This l",

When investigating criminal activities, officers often turn to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect digital evidence. This evidence can range from incriminating posts and photos to private messages and location data. The process of data collection involves sophisticated techniques and tools that allow law enforcement to extract relevant information without breaching privacy laws. For instance, metadata from photos can reveal the time and location of an event, while public posts can provide insights into a suspect's motives and connections. The importance of digital evidence cannot be overstated, as it often serves as a critical piece of the puzzle in criminal investigations. However, collecting digital evidence from social media platforms is not without its challenges. Law enforcement agencies must navigate a complex web of privacy settings and legal restrictions to obtain the necessary data. In many cases, they require warrants or subpoenas to access private information. Additionally, the sheer volume of data available on social media can be overwhelming, necessitating the use of advanced software and algorithms to sift through the noise and identify pertinent evidence. Despite these hurdles, the role of social media in criminal investigations continues to grow, providing invaluable support to law enforcement in their quest for justice. Social Media Surveillance Social media surveillance has become a vital tool for police forces worldwide. By monitoring online activity, law enforcement can identify potential threats, track criminal behavior, and gather intelligence on suspects.

Shelly In today\u2019s digital media society, is it ever truly possible to ensure that jury trials are fair and impartial? Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, criminal defendants are guaranteed specific rights, including the right to have their case heard by an impartial jury.[1] Furthermore, the Seventh Amendment also provides civil litigants with essentially the same rights.[2] Beginning with the pre-trial process of voir dire, judges and lawyers seek to uphold these constitutional rights by questioning potential jurors in order to identify whether the individuals can be fair and unbiased during trial.[3] If a potential juror demonstrates any bias that might unfairly impact the trial\u2019s outcome, the juror may be eliminated from the jury selection process.[4] Although the concept of finding an impartial jury may seem straightforward, the emerging presence of social media has presented a few bumps in the road to a fair trial.[5] With the increasing popularity of social media sites, it is of no surprise that most Americans utilize social media on a daily basis.[6] \u00a0Such individuals may use social media for different purposes, such as connecting with others, sharing information, receiving entertainment, or obtaining news.[7] \u00a0Furthermore, professionals in the legal sector may even use social media as a way to promote business or gain clientele. Although the widespread use of social media has perks, it nonetheless has complicated the Sixth and Seventh Amendment rights to an impartial jury.[8] More specifically, social media has created the risk that jurors may (1) use social media to communicate, r",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles \u2013 either online, in the real world, or both. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Societal Implications of Cancel Culture The Rise of Cancel Culture: Social, Cultural, and Technological Factors Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there\u2019s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals\u2019 actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These plat",

Those forecasting improvement place their hopes in technological fixes and in societal solutions. Others think the dark side of human nature is aided more than stifled by technology. In late 2016, Oxford Dictionaries selected \u201cpost-truth\u201d as the word of the year, defining it as \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d The 2016 Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the tumultuous U.S. presidential election highlighted how the digital age has affected news and cultural narratives. New information platforms feed the ancient instinct people have to find information that syncs with their perspectives: A 2016 study that analyzed 376 million Facebook users\u2019 interactions with over 900 news outlets found that people tend to seek information that aligns with their views. This makes many vulnerable to accepting and acting on misinformation.

Fact-checks on information often fall behind the diffusion of misinformation, which can lead to negative impacts on society. This research studies how different factors may affect the spread of fact-checks over the internet. We collected a dataset of fact-checks in a six-month period and analyzed how they spread on Twitter. The spread of fact-checks is measured by the total retweet count. The factors/variables include the truthfulness rating, topic of information, source credibility, etc. The research identifies truthfulness rating as a significant factor: conclusive fact-checks (either true or false) tend to be shared more than others. In addition, the source credibility, political leaning, and the sharing count also affect the spread of fact-checks. The findings of this research provide practical insights into accelerating the spread of the truth in the battle against misinformation online.

The Pew Research Center's study on the future of online information emphasizes how the spread of misinformation and biased narratives can be amplified by technology and user behavior, obstructing a fair and balanced understanding of legal issues. The pursuit of justice necessitates due process and accurate information, which online public opinion trials often fail to provide. While platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute are valuable, conflating them with trials driven by public sentiment disregards the distinct dangers of the latter.

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

The popularization and application of the Internet has brought great convenience to the people, promoted the communication and interaction between the government and the people, and added new ways of expressing public opinion; the Internet is highly developed, and the government makes full use of its role to collect social opinions through Internet. Public opinion promotes the democratization and scientific rationality of public policies. This article will discuss the following aspects: first, focus on the influence of online public opinion on public policy, explain the research background of the article, analyze and organize it; second, consult relevant literature, sort out the related concepts of online public opinion and public policy and characteristics; third, analyze the value of online public opinion on public policies, including positive and negative effects, based on cases, data, and referenced literature; finally, put forward targeted suggestions and countermeasures for existing problems, including improvement. The government plays an important role in the construction of network infrastructure and strengthening the moral education of netizens. It is necessary to do a good job in guiding the network public opinion, devote itself to creating a good and healthy network atmosphere, and attach importance to the dual influence of network public opinion on public policies, to make it fully play its positive role.

Thus, a more practical approach is urgently needed to deal with this dynamic and complicated phenomenon of propagating public opinion. This paper proposes that the outbreak of internet public opinion and its negative impacts, such as the occurrence of major security incidents, are a result of coupling and the complex interaction of many factors. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method model is composed of those factors and considers the stages of network information dissemination, the unique propagation rule, and textual sentiment resonance on the internet. Moreover, it is the first public opinion governance method that simultaneously highlights the complex system, functional identification, and functional resonance. It suggests a more effective method to shorten the dissipation time of negative public opinion and is a considerable improvement over previous models for risk-prediction. Based on resonance theory and deep learning, this study establishes public opinion resonance functions, which made it possible to analyze public opinion triggers and b",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment.

The article cites examples of individuals being targeted for actions deemed socially deviant, illustrating how online platforms facilitate rapid dissemination of accusations and judgments, often with little regard for due process.  This creates a climate ripe for vigilantism, as individuals take justice into their own hands, fueled by public outrage amplified by social media algorithms.  Furthermore, studies demonstrate the overlap between online and offline harassment and violence (5_5, 5_7).  This shows the real-world consequences of online shaming, moving beyond mere online condemnation to tangible harm. While some may argue online platforms allow for content moderation, the sheer volume and speed of online discourse makes effective control challenging, leaving individuals vulnerable to mob justice.  The potential for misjudgment and disproportionate punishment is high, particularly when emotions run high in online environments.",

These modern-day guardians of the digital realm are neither caped crusaders nor masked avengers, but they do wield a power that challenges traditional notions of justice. Welcome to the world of cyber vigilantism, where the line between hero and villain blurs in the name of online righteousness. At the forefront of studying this phenomenon is Dr. Leanna Ireland, PhD, assistant professor of criminal justice in the Department of Economics, Justice and Policy Studies at Mount Royal University. With a keen interest in vigilantism in the online world, Ireland is shedding light on new forms of activism, social movements and justice-seeking behaviour. The rise of cyber vigilantism Vigilantism \u2014 where people take justice into their own hands \u2014 has a long history, dating back to ancient times. The internet has moved the practice forward by allowing millions of people to engage in a single act of vigilantism all at once. Despite new technology, motives such as frustration over the inaction of authorities have remained largely unchanged over time. Today, some self-appointed crimefighters target serious criminal offences such as child exploitation. For example, one of the top results for \u201cped(ophile) hunter\u201d on TikTok is an account with more than 183,000 followers. Others take on socially deviant cases. An early example comes from 2005 in which a young woman refused to clean up after her dog did its business in a subway car in South Korea. A fellow commuter posted pictures on social media and the incident turned into a viral sensation, sparking outrage online. \u201cUndoubtedly, acts of cyber vigilantism are becoming more commonplace with the proliferation of digital tools,\u201d Ireland says. \u201cMore people \u2014 regardless of their technical skills \u2014 can now engage in cyber vigilantism efforts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to create an X or TikTok account and shame someone for their actions and, or, release their pe",

By Steven Lee Myers It is well known that social media amplifies misinformation and other harmful content. The Integrity Institute, an advocacy group, is now trying to measure exactly how much \u2014 and on Thursday it began publishing results that it plans to update each week through the midterm elections on Nov. 8. The institute\u2019s initial report, posted online, found that a \u201cwell-crafted lie\u201d will get more engagements than typical, truthful content and that some features of social media sites and their algorithms contribute to the spread of misinformation. Twitter, the analysis showed, has what the institute called the great misinformation amplification factor, in large part because of its feature allowing people to share, or \u201cretweet,\u201d posts easily. It was followed by TikTok, the Chinese-owned video site, which uses machine-learning models to predict engagement and make recommendations to users. \u201cWe see a difference for each platform because each platform has different mechanisms for virality on it,\u201d said Jeff Allen, a former integrity officer at Facebook and a founder and the chief research officer at the Integrity Institute. \u201cThe more mechanisms there are for virality on the platform, the more we see misinformation getting additional distribution.\u201d The institute calculated its findings by comparing posts that members of the International Fact-Checking Network have identified as false with the engagement of previous posts that were not flagged from the same accounts. It analyzed nearly 600 fact-checked posts in September on a variety of subjects, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the upcoming elections. Facebook, according to the sample that the institute has studied so far, had the most instances of misinformation but amplified such claims to a lesser degree, in part because sharing posts requires more steps.

Yet, audience selectivity\u2014inherent within today\u2019s high-choice media environments\u2014has largely been disregarded. Relatedly, the predominance of forced-exposure designs is a source of concern. This article proposes the integration of audience selectivity into media stereotype effects research. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u20091,166) indicated that prejudiced individuals tended to approach prejudice-consistent stereotypical news and avoid prejudice-challenging counter-stereotypical news. Using a forced-exposure experiment, study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009380) showed detrimental effects of prejudice-consistent news and beneficial effects of prejudice-challenging news. Relying on a self-selected exposure paradigm, study 3 (N\u2009=\u20091,149) provided evidence for preference-based reinforcement. Study 4\u2019s \u201cnet-effect perspective\u201d (N\u2009=\u2009937) indicated that operationalizing exposure as forced or self-selected can lead to different interpretations of actual societal effects. The findings emphasize the key role played by audience selectivity when studying media effects. The media portray many social categories, such as minority groups, in a stereotypical way (Billings & Parrott, 2020). This is problematic, as media depictions often represent the main, if not the only, source of information for citizens (Ramasubramanian & Murphy, 2014). Previous research has already acknowledged the importance of studying the effects of exposure to media stereotypes on essential outcomes, such as prejudice. This l",

When investigating criminal activities, officers often turn to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect digital evidence. This evidence can range from incriminating posts and photos to private messages and location data. The process of data collection involves sophisticated techniques and tools that allow law enforcement to extract relevant information without breaching privacy laws. For instance, metadata from photos can reveal the time and location of an event, while public posts can provide insights into a suspect's motives and connections. The importance of digital evidence cannot be overstated, as it often serves as a critical piece of the puzzle in criminal investigations. However, collecting digital evidence from social media platforms is not without its challenges. Law enforcement agencies must navigate a complex web of privacy settings and legal restrictions to obtain the necessary data. In many cases, they require warrants or subpoenas to access private information. Additionally, the sheer volume of data available on social media can be overwhelming, necessitating the use of advanced software and algorithms to sift through the noise and identify pertinent evidence. Despite these hurdles, the role of social media in criminal investigations continues to grow, providing invaluable support to law enforcement in their quest for justice. Social Media Surveillance Social media surveillance has become a vital tool for police forces worldwide. By monitoring online activity, law enforcement can identify potential threats, track criminal behavior, and gather intelligence on suspects. This form of surveillance involves the use of specialized software that can scan social media platforms for keywords, hashtags, and patterns indicative of criminal activity. For example, police might monitor posts related to drug t",

Shelly In today\u2019s digital media society, is it ever truly possible to ensure that jury trials are fair and impartial? Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, criminal defendants are guaranteed specific rights, including the right to have their case heard by an impartial jury.[1] Furthermore, the Seventh Amendment also provides civil litigants with essentially the same rights.[2] Beginning with the pre-trial process of voir dire, judges and lawyers seek to uphold these constitutional rights by questioning potential jurors in order to identify whether the individuals can be fair and unbiased during trial.[3] If a potential juror demonstrates any bias that might unfairly impact the trial\u2019s outcome, the juror may be eliminated from the jury selection process.[4] Although the concept of finding an impartial jury may seem straightforward, the emerging presence of social media has presented a few bumps in the road to a fair trial.[5] With the increasing popularity of social media sites, it is of no surprise that most Americans utilize social media on a daily basis.[6] \u00a0Such individuals may use social media for different purposes, such as connecting with others, sharing information, receiving entertainment, or obtaining news.[7] \u00a0Furthermore, professionals in the legal sector may even use social media as a way to promote business or gain clientele. Although the widespread use of social media has perks, it nonetheless has complicated the Sixth and Seventh Amendment rights to an impartial jury.[8] More specifically, social media has created the risk that jurors may (1) use social media to communicate, r",

For instance, metadata from photos can reveal the time and location of an event, while public posts can provide insights into a suspect's motives and connections. The importance of digital evidence cannot be overstated, as it often serves as a critical piece of the puzzle in criminal investigations. However, collecting digital evidence from social media platforms is not without its challenges. Law enforcement agencies must navigate a complex web of privacy settings and legal restrictions to obtain the necessary data. In many cases, they require warrants or subpoenas to access private information. Additionally, the sheer volume of data available on social media can be overwhelming, necessitating the use of advanced software and algorithms to sift through the noise and identify pertinent evidence. Despite these hurdles, the role of social media in criminal investigations continues to grow, providing invaluable support to law enforcement in their quest for justice. Social Media Surveillance Social media surveillance has become a vital tool for police forces worldwide. By monitoring online activity, law enforcement can identify potential threats, track criminal behavior, and gather intelligence on suspects. This form of surveillance involves the use of specialized software that can scan social media platforms for keywords, hashtags, and patterns indicative of criminal activity. For example, police might monitor posts related to drug t",

This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment (\"5_5\", \"5_6\") and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities (\"7_20\", \"7_23\"). Such trials prioritize public sentiment over legal processes, failing to maximize societal benefit and potentially causing significant harm.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: {'claim': 'Minimizing harm is an insufficient criterion for evaluating online public opinion trials.', 'argument': ['The affirmative team suggests that maximizing societal benefit is a superior criterion because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.', 'They argue that this holistic approach aligns better with the core principles of justice, which aim to promote fairness and equity.', 'They cite a study in the Journal of Information Policy highlighting how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable.']}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_45', 'query': 'Negative consequences of online public opinion trials', 'title': 'Online public opinion evaluation through the functional resonance ...', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972099/'}, {'id': '6_47', 'query': 'Negative consequences of online public opinion trials', 'title': 'Online public opinion dissemination model and simulation under media ...', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077922011389'}]\n**Short Argument**: Maximizing societal benefit as the sole criterion for evaluating online public opinion trials is insufficient and dangerous. While positive contributions exist, focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm, like the spread of misinformation (\"6_47\") and negative public opinion outbreaks (\"6_45\") documented in studies. These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote.  A balanced approach that prioritizes minimizing harm is crucial for true societal benefit.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: {'claim': 'Online public opinion trials encourage vigilantism and mob justice.', 'argument': ['Online platforms can be used to publicly shame and condemn individuals before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.', 'This bypasses due process and fosters mob rule, undermining the legal system.', 'The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment.', \"Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism notes public shaming as a common tactic.\"]}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_0', 'query': 'Examples of online public opinion trials leading to vigilantism', 'title': 'Internet vigilantism - Wikipedia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism'}, {'id': '5_2', 'query': 'Examples of online public opinion trials leading to vigilantism', 'title': 'Unmasking cyber vigilantism: MRU prof explores online justice', 'url': 'https://www.mtroyal.ca/AboutMountRoyal/MediaRoom/Stories/2023/12/unmasking-cyber-vigilantism.htm'}, {'id': '5_5', 'query': 'Cases of online shaming leading to offline harassment or violence', 'title': 'Connections Between Online Harassment and Offline Violence among Youth ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461520/'}, {'id': '5_7', 'query': 'Cases of online shaming leading to offline harassment or violence', 'title': 'Co-occurrence of online and offline bullying and sexual harassment ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9543120/'}]\n\n**Medium Argument**: The very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms like X and TikTok enable rapid dissemination of accusations and judgments, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process can take place (5_2).  This online shaming often spills into offline harassment and violence, as documented in cases where online and offline bullying/harassment co-occur (5_7, 5_5). The speed and breadth of social media amplify the potential for misjudgment and disproportionate punishment.  While some online discussions might focus on awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics mentioned even in Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism (5_0). Thus, these trials create an environment ripe for mob justice, undermining the legal system.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: {'claim': 'Online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices.', 'argument': ['Studies show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers.', 'Online platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly.', 'Individuals are judged based on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth.', 'The study \"Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement\" supports the claim of bias amplification.']}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_0', 'query': 'How online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices', 'title': 'Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based ...', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/73/5/463/7190600'}, {'id': '8_45', 'query': 'Influence of online echo chambers on individual perspectives', 'title': 'Echo Chamber - (Race and Gender in Media) - Fiveable', 'url': 'https://fiveable.me/key-terms/race-and-gender-in-media/echo-chamber'}, {'id': '1_6', 'query': 'What is the relationship between social media and misinformation?', 'title': 'How Social Media Amplifies Misinformation More Than ...', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/technology/misinformation-integrity-institute-report.html'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Online public opinion trials exacerbate biases.  Prejudiced individuals naturally seek confirming information online, creating echo chambers (8_45). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate rapidly (1_6).  People are judged based on amplified pre-existing biases (2_0), hindering impartial justice.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: {'claim': 'Online public opinion trials erode due process rights.', 'argument': []}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_17', 'query': 'Impact of social media on due process and fair trials', 'title': \"Preserving the Right to a Fair Trial: Social Media's Impact on ...\", 'url': 'https://cumberlandtrialjournal.com/2024/04/28/preserving-the-right-to-a-fair-trial-social-medias-impact-on-the-jury/'}, {'id': '5_18', 'query': 'Impact of social media on due process and fair trials', 'title': 'Social Media, Venue and the Right to a Fair Trial', 'url': 'https://digitalcommons.pace.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2133&context=lawfaculty'}, {'id': '0_16', 'query': 'Relationship between social media and due process', 'title': 'OPINION: Trial by social media harms due process rights', 'url': 'https://www.alestlelive.com/opinion/article_ab914f3e-89fe-11ec-a75a-67333a862d82.html'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Social media's swift dissemination of information often leads to premature judgments in high-profile cases, impacting the integrity of due process.  \"Preserving the Right to a Fair Trial\" (5_17) details how social media influences jurors even before trial. The instantaneous nature of online platforms bypasses the structured, evidence-based legal process, creating a \"trial by social media\" environment as discussed in \"OPINION: Trial by social media harms due process rights\" (0_16). This undermines the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial, key components of due process, jeopardizing the impartiality necessary for justice. This aligns with the concerns raised in \"Social Media, Venue and the Right to a Fair Trial\" (5_18) about social media bias threatening due process.\n\n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, judges, and esteemed audience, the affirmative team\u2019s arguments, while superficially appealing, fail to address the fundamental flaws of online public opinion trials. Their attempts to redefine the motion, shift the judging criteria, and downplay the inherent risks only serve to highlight the weakness of their position.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address their broad definition of online public opinion trials. While resources like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and Electronic Case Filings websites [2] undoubtedly offer valuable legal information, they are distinct from the often-toxic environment of online public opinion trials.  These trials, as we defined, involve public judgment and condemnation, often based on incomplete information.  This distinction is crucial.  While legal information platforms promote informed citizenry, online trials frequently devolve into biased, emotionally-charged judgments.  This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment ([3], [4]) and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities ([5], [6]).\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider their proposed judging criteria of \"maximizing societal benefit.\"  While a laudable goal, it's dangerously incomplete.  Focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm. Studies document the spread of misinformation [7] and negative public opinion outbreaks [8] resulting from online trials.  These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote. A balanced approach, prioritizing minimizing harm, is crucial. Imagine being subjected to a trial by social media, your reputation tarnished before due process, based on misinformation amplified by algorithms. Where is the societal benefit in that?\n\nThe affirmative\u2019s claim that vigilantism isn\u2019t an inherent outcome of online discussions is simply wishful thinking.  While content moderation exists, the very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms enable rapid dissemination of accusations, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process ( [9]). This often spills into offline harassment and violence, documented in cases where online and offline bullying co-occur ([10], [3]).  While some online discussions might raise awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics ( [9]).  Think about how quickly misinformation spreads online, how easily individuals can be targeted and harassed.  This is not justice; it's a dangerous erosion of due process.\n\nFinally, their argument about mitigating bias ignores the reality of echo chambers.  Prejudiced individuals seek confirming information online ( [11]). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate [12].  Individuals are judged based on amplified pre-existing biases [13], hindering impartial justice.  Their claim of diverse perspectives is often drowned out by the cacophony of biased information amplified by algorithms designed for engagement, not truth.\n\nFurthermore, let's address the critical issue of due process.  Social media's rapid information dissemination leads to premature judgments, impacting due process integrity ( [14]). This instantaneous nature bypasses the structured, evidence-based legal process, creating a \"trial by social media\" environment ([15]). This undermines the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial ([16]), jeopardizing impartiality.  Consider the potential consequences: your life upended by online accusations before you have a chance to defend yourself in a court of law. This is not justice; this is a dangerous perversion of it.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Cornell Law School. *Legal Information Institute*. www.law.cornell.edu/lii/\n[2] Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. pacer.gov\n[3]  Hinduja, Sameer, and Justin W.

While our opponents have focused on potential harms, we maintain that these platforms, when understood broadly, bring us closer to justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nOur opponents define online public opinion trials narrowly as mere \"judgment and condemnation.\" However, this ignores the multifaceted nature of online engagement with legal issues.  Online platforms are crucial for sharing information, fostering discussions, and promoting legal education. These activities, which *precede* judgment, empower citizens to form nuanced opinions and contribute to a more informed public discourse. Studies show online discussions can lead to deeper analysis and critical thinking about legal issues [17].  Moreover, online platforms have facilitated positive legal outcomes, such as petitions leading to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [19] and crowdsourced investigations helping identify suspects in criminal cases [10].\n\nThe negative team advocates for \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criteria.  While harm reduction is important, their narrow focus overlooks the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice. Our criterion, \"maximizing societal benefit,\" encompasses both harm reduction and the active promotion of justice.  Increased transparency, a key feature of online discussions, holds legal actors accountable [9] and promotes fairness [8].  Furthermore, online platforms amplify marginalized voices [12], ensuring their concerns are heard and addressed, contributing to a more equitable legal system.\n\nOur opponents raise valid concerns about due process\n\n**Reference**\n(1)  Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. *Manufacturing Consent*.

The term encompasses vigilantism against alleged scams, crimes, and non-Internet-related behavior. The expanding scope of media savvy and online interaction has enabled vigilantes to utilize methods specific to the Internet in order to distribute justice to parties they consider to be corrupt, but who have not committed a formal crime or have not been held accountable by the criminal justice system.[1] Internet vigilantism originated in the early 2000s and has since evolved to include a variety of methods such as hacking, baiting, and public shaming. Internet vigilantism changes in cultural and political drive depending on location, and has varying relationships to state authority depending on context. There are many internet vigilante groups as well as individuals. Description The term internet vigilantism describes punitive public denunciations, aimed at swaying public opinion in order to \u201ctake justice into one's own hands\u201d by engaging in forms of targeted surveillance, unwanted attention, negative publicity, repression, coercion or dissuasion. Associate professor in sociology Benjamin Loveluck identifies the four main forms of internet vigilantism as: flagging, investigation, hounding, and organized denunciation. Also referred to by Steve Man as Sousveillance, meaning \"to watch from below\", internet vigilantism can work as a type of peer surveillance. This is based on the premise that shame can be used as a form of social control.[2] August\u0117 Dementavi\u010dien\u0117 defines the phenomena through the concept of Swarms, which are \"Short term relationships between consumers formed for the purpose of achieving a goal\".[3] There are muddied overlaps between internet vigilantism and cyberbullying, as both utilize public shaming methods, and cyberbullying may sometimes be conducted under the guise of internet vigilantism. This is in the case that the vigilante \"realizes they aren't achieving social justice b",

Here, weaponised visibility supersedes police intervention as an appropriate response. Digital vigilantism is a user-led violation of privacy that not only transcends online/offline distinctions but also complicates relations of visibility and control between police and the public. This paper develops a theoretically nuanced and empirically grounded understanding of digital vigilantism in order to advance a research agenda in this area of study. In addition to literature on vigilantism and citizen-led violence, this paper draws from key works in surveillance (Haggerty and Ericsson, British Journal of Sociology, 51, 605\u2013622, 2000) as well as visibility studies (Brighenti 2007; Goldsmith, British Journal of Criminology, 50(5), 914\u2013934, 2010) in order to situate how digital media affordances and cultures inform both the moral and organisational dimensions of digital vigilantism. Digital vigilantism is a process where citizens are collectively offended by other citizen activity, and coordinate retaliation on mobile devices and social platforms. The offending acts range from mild breaches of social protocol to terrorist acts and participation in riots. The vigilantism includes, but is not limited to a \u2018naming and shaming\u2019 ",

These modern-day guardians of the digital realm are neither caped crusaders nor masked avengers, but they do wield a power that challenges traditional notions of justice. Welcome to the world of cyber vigilantism, where the line between hero and villain blurs in the name of online righteousness. At the forefront of studying this phenomenon is Dr. Leanna Ireland, PhD, assistant professor of criminal justice in the Department of Economics, Justice and Policy Studies at Mount Royal University. With a keen interest in vigilantism in the online world, Ireland is shedding light on new forms of activism, social movements and justice-seeking behaviour. The rise of cyber vigilantism Vigilantism \u2014 where people take justice into their own hands \u2014 has a long history, dating back to ancient times. The internet has moved the practice forward by allowing millions of people to engage in a single act of vigilantism all at once. Despite new technology, motives such as frustration over the inaction of authorities have remained largely unchanged over time. Today, some self-appointed crimefighters target serious criminal offences such as child exploitation. For example, one of the top results for \u201cped(ophile) hunter\u201d on TikTok is an account with more than 183,000 followers. Others take on socially deviant cases. An early example comes from 2005 in which a young woman refused to clean up after her dog did its business in a subway car in South Korea. A fellow commuter posted pictures on social media and the incident turned into a viral sensation, sparking outrage online. \u201cUndoubtedly, acts of cyber vigilantism are becoming more commonplace with the proliferation of digital tools,\u201d Ireland says. \u201cMore people \u2014 regardless of their technical skills \u2014 can now engage in cyber vigilantism efforts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to create an X or TikTok account and shame someone for their actions and, or, release their pe",

This study was conducted to quantitatively assess the associations between offline violence and online harassment among youth in Central Thailand. Students and out-of-school youth (n = 1,234, age: 15-24 years) residing, studying, and/or working in a district in Central Thailand were surveyed. Participants were asked about their involvement in online harassment and in verbal, physical, sexual, and domestic types of offline violence, as perpetrators, victims, and witnesses within a 1-year period. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess independent associations between different kinds of involvement in offline violence and online harassment. Perpetration and victimization within the past year were both reported by roughly half of the youth both online and offline. Over three qu",

Moreover, in the last decades, new forms of harassment, control, and abuse through social networks and mobile phones have arisen. Therefore, now forms of online and offline dating violence coexist. Objectives The aim was to analyze the prevalence rates by sex and age and the co-occurrence of online and offline dating violence. Moreover, the roles of online and offline dating violence aggressors and victims for their self-esteem, hostility, general psychological state, and emotional intelligence were investigated. Method Three hundred forty-one university students from the Basque Country, Spain, participated in the study. They completed six validated instruments related to the mentioned variables. Results Results highlight the high prevalence of online and offline dating violence in the sample and the co-occurrence of both types. No gender nor sex differences were found for online and offline dating violence perpetration and victimization. The correlation between online and offline dating violence was confirmed, and the reciprocity of violence is greater for offline violence. In relation to the role, both types of victims (online and offline) showed higher levels of hostility and psychological symptomatology than non-victims, but differences in self-esteem and emotional regulation were found in these modalities. Online and offline perpetrators shared hostility and some psychological symptoms as characteristics compared to non-victims, but differed in other symptoms and emotional intelligence.

This gap is most evident in Belgium, where 62% of those who feel their political system allows them to have a say in politics also say that social media is a good thing for democracy in their country, compared with 44% among those who say that their political system does not allow them much influence on politics. Those who view the spread of false information online as a major threat to their country are less likely to say that social media is a good thing for democracy, compared with those who view the spread of misinformation online as either a minor threat or not a threat at all. This is most clearly observed in the Netherlands, where only four-in-ten (39%) among those who see the spread of false information online as a major threat say that social media has been a good thing for democracy in their country, as opposed to the nearly six-in-ten (57%) among those who do not consider the spread of misinformation online to be a threat who say the same. This pattern is evident in eight other countries as well. Views also vary by age. Older adults in 12 countries are less likely to say that social med",

Thus, social norms that influence and encourage gender violence have been targeted by policy interventions using mass media communication. Prior research suggests that media influences through two effects: the individual or direct effect (private) or the social or indirect effect (public). In the individual effect, media information about new norms may persuade individuals to accept them. In the social effect, the information creates common knowledge of a norm and enhances social coordination as individuals more readily accept the information if they believe others have also accepted it. This study examined whether media\u2019s social mechanism has a stronger impact than its individual mechanism on changing violent attitudes against women. This study conducted a natural and randomized experiment in the rural indigenous community of San Bartolome Quialana in Oaxaca, Mexico using a multi-part soap opera radio program telling a story of a relationship that slowly becomes violent.

Significance Popular wisdom suggests that the internet plays a major role in influencing people\u2019s attitudes and behaviors related to politics, such as by providing slanted sources of information. Yet evidence for this proposition is elusive due to methodological difficulties and the multifaceted nature of online media effects. This study breaks ground by demonstrating a nudge-like approach for exploring these effects through a combination of real-world experimentation and computational social science techniques. The results confirm that it is difficult for people to be persuaded by competing media accounts during a contentious election campaign. At the same time, data from a longer time span suggest that the real consequence of online partisan media may be an erosion of trust in mainstream news.

Social media usage in public opinion has many objectives that differ from one case to another, as we will explain in more detail in this article. However, they can be summed up in two general objectives: 1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Changing an unwanted situation by creating a collective mindset through which the public can unite to take a stand on social or political issues and create social movements. 2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Creating a positive mental image for the brand or company in the public\u2019s mind. Introduction on how social media influences public opinion After the technological revolution dominated the world and changed our lifestyle and way of exchanging knowledge, social media became the most significant influence on public opinion. A person\u2019s awareness, personality, and thinking pattern are shaped by what they acquire from the behaviors and information present in their surrounding environment. That environment includes; family, friends, school, places of worship, religious practices, and any other place or means they can interact with others and learn from. That can happen through face-to-face communication or any cultural or artistic forms such as; books, music, or movies. With the advent of the internet and social media, they have become a major component of the environment that constitutes and affects human awareness, inclinations, opinions, and even behaviors. It has also become the easiest way to communicate with different people from all over the world, access information from various sources in the easiest and fastest way, and learn the diverse ideologies of different cultures. That is how social media influences public opinion and moves the audience towards the desired behavior. What impact does social media hav",

                  "raw_content": " How Social Media Impacts Criminal Cases Digital Evidence Collection In today's digital age, social media platforms have become treasure troves of information for law enforcement agencies. When investigating criminal activities, officers often turn to platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram to collect digital evidence. This evidence can range from incriminating posts and photos to private messages and location data. The process of data collection involves sophisticated techniques and tools that allow law enforcement to extract relevant information without breaching privacy laws. For instance, metadata from photos can reveal the time and location of an event, while public posts can provide insights into a suspect's motives and connections. The importance of digital evidence cannot be overstated, as it often serves as a critical piece of the puzzle in criminal investigations. However, collecting digital evidence from social media platforms is not without its challenges. Law enforcement agencies must navigate a complex web of privacy settings and legal restrictions to obtain the necessary data. In many cases, they require warrants or subpoenas to access private information. Additionally, the sheer volume of data available on social media can be overwhelming, necessitating the use of advanced software and algorithms to sift through the noise and identify pertinent evidence. Despite these hurdles, the role of social media in criminal investigations continues to grow, providing invaluable support to law enforcement in their quest for justice. Social Media Surveillance Social media surveillance has become a vital tool for police forces worldwide. By monitoring online activity, law enforcement can identify potential threats, track criminal behavior, and gather intelligence on suspects. This form of surveillance involves the use of specialized software that can scan social media platforms for keywords, hashtags, and patterns indicative of criminal activity. For example, police might monitor posts related to drug t",

Shelly In today\u2019s digital media society, is it ever truly possible to ensure that jury trials are fair and impartial? Pursuant to the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, criminal defendants are guaranteed specific rights, including the right to have their case heard by an impartial jury.[1] Furthermore, the Seventh Amendment also provides civil litigants with essentially the same rights.[2] Beginning with the pre-trial process of voir dire, judges and lawyers seek to uphold these constitutional rights by questioning potential jurors in order to identify whether the individuals can be fair and unbiased during trial.[3] If a potential juror demonstrates any bias that might unfairly impact the trial\u2019s outcome, the juror may be eliminated from the jury selection process.[4] Although the concept of finding an impartial jury may seem straightforward, the emerging presence of social media has presented a few bumps in the road to a fair trial.[5] With the increasing popularity of social media sites, it is of no surprise that most Americans utilize social media on a daily basis.[6] \u00a0Such individuals may use social media for different purposes, such as connecting with others, sharing information, receiving entertainment, or obtaining news.[7] \u00a0Furthermore, professionals in the legal sector may even use social media as a way to promote business or gain clientele. Although the widespread use of social media has perks, it nonetheless has complicated the Sixth and Seventh Amendment rights to an impartial jury.[8] More specifically, social media has created the risk that jurors may (1) use social media to communicate, r",

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes.

In particular, the technology of public shaming is ambiguous between two senses. On the one hand, public shaming depends on various technologies, such as social media posts or, more historically, pillories. These are the artifacts of shame. On the other hand, public shaming itself is a social technology. In particular, public shaming is a way for communities to promote cooperation. Ultimately, I claim there is a mismatch between the artifacts of shame and this important social technology of shame. Social media drifts toward disintegrative shame, which tends to corrode cooperation. This suggests that we must either realign the technology of public shame or reject shame as a legitimate option.

Login Alert Article contents Social Media, Social Control, and the Politics of Public Shaming Published online by Cambridge University Press: 31 October 2023 Abstract While there is disagreement over the value of public shaming, scholars largely agree that social media introduce pathologies. But while scholars rightly identify the effects of online public shaming (OPS), they misidentify the cause. Rather than solely a problem of scale, OPS\u2019s effects are also shaped by the network structure within which they take place. In this article, I argue that the social conditions necessary for productive public shaming are more likely to obtain in a closed social network structure. Using the cases of Twitter, Wikipedia, and Reddit, I show how the design of social media platforms facilitates different network structures among users, with differing results for OPS. In evaluating OPS by way of network structure, I argue, we can not only better understand why OPS works productively in some cases and not in others, but also derive lessons for how to deploy, discuss, and respond to it more effectively. In September 2012, european_douchebag posted a photo to r/funny of a Sikh woman with untrimmed facial hair. R/funny is a large community on the social media platform Reddit\u2014at the time, it had over 2.5 million members and european_douchebag\u2019s original thread garnered over 1,500 comments. While many of the responses were relatively derogatory to start, the tone of the conversation soon shifted; commenters began to shame european_douchebag for making fun of the woman pictured. Later, the photo\u2019s subject responded directly to the post, bringing national media attention to the incident (The Huffington Post 2012). Five days after that, european_douchebag deleted his account. Echoing the sentiments of other subjects of high-profile online publ",

Abstract Introduction Social psychological research on collective action and intergroup harm has yet to adequately consider the potential role of cancel culture or feelings of collective validation in motivating collective action. The current research will begin to fill this gap and may broaden our understanding of the psychological mechanisms that inspire and maintain collective action in response to intergroup harm. To our knowledge, this research is the first social psychological analysis of the impact of cancel culture on collective action and as means for producing feelings of collective validation.

At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles \u2013 either online, in the real world, or both. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Societal Implications of Cancel Culture The Rise of Cancel Culture: Social, Cultural, and Technological Factors Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there\u2019s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals\u2019 actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These plat",

While many of us have seen the term cancel culture online, we don't know what it really means. Cancel culture is widely known as a movement to \u201ccancel\u201d or remove celebrity status, and it's a dangerous bandwagon to hop on (Vogels, 2022). Peer pressure's influence is ingrained into our culture. We see one video or article and are totally convinced that it's true. However, the truth is that cancel culture is not healthy and can lead to severe outcomes. I, myself, am guilty of hopping on the train, but together we can learn how to be active bystanders and cancel \u201ccancel culture!\u201d The Real Deal about Cancel Culture The phrase \u201ccancel culture\u201d first originated from the word cancel, meaning to cut ties with someone. We've seen it referenced in film and television and we see it now gaining traction on social media (Vogels, 2021). There are a variety of opinions on what the purpose of cancel culture is for: holding people accountable, punishing those who do wrong, or simply using it as a source of entertainment. There is also often a confusion between \u201ccall-out culture\u201d and \u201ccancel culture\u201d. Call-out culture brings attention to someone's mistakes and gives them a chance to learn from and correct the issue, while cancel culture immediately labels them as bad, sometimes permanently (Toler, 2022). Call-out culture holds people accountable for their actions by addressing problematic behavior while opening dialogue and discussion. This allows people to understand each other better, ultimately creating an opportunity for reflection. Compared to cancel culture, call-out culture's forgiveness fosters a sense of community responsibility and encourages personal",

But the internet \u2013 particularly social media \u2013 has changed how, when and where these kinds of interactions occur. The number of people who can go online and call out others for their behavior or words is immense, and it\u2019s never been easier to summon groups to join the public fray. The phrase\u00a0\u201ccancel culture\u201d is said to have originated\u00a0from a relatively obscure slang term \u2013 \u201ccancel,\u201d referring to\u00a0breaking up with someone\u00a0\u2013 used in a 1980s song. This term was then referenced in film and television and later evolved and gained traction on social media. Over the past several years, cancel culture has become a deeply contested idea in the nation\u2019s political discourse. There are plenty of debates over what it is and what it means, including whether it\u2019s a way to hold people accountable, or a tactic to punish others unjustly, or a mix of both. And some argue that cancel culture doesn\u2019t even exist. To better understand how the U.S. public views the concept of cancel culture, Pew Research Center asked Americans in September 2020 to share \u2013 in their own words \u2013 what they think the term means and, more broadly, how they feel about the act of calling out others on social media. The survey finds a public deeply divided, including over the very meaning of the phrase. Pew Research Center has a long history of studying the tone and nature of online discourse as well as emerging internet phenomena.\u00a0This report focuses on American adults\u2019 perceptions of cancel culture and, more generally, calling out others on social media. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,093 U.S. adults from Sept. 8 to 13, 2020.

These platforms offer unparalleled opportunities for sharing information and connecting with people worldwide. However, as social media\u2019s influence continues to grow, its impact on legal proceedings cannot be ignored. From influencing public opinion to presenting potential evidence, social media has both positive and negative implications for the legal system. The Power of Public Opinion: Social media platforms have given a voice to the masses, allowing individuals to express their opinions freely and instantaneously. This freedom of expression has the potential to sway public opinion and influence legal proceedings. High-profile cases are often accompanied by intense online discussions, debates, and sometimes even campaigns that can exert pressure on the justice system. While public awareness and involvement can be beneficial in ensuring justice, the challenge lies in separating fact from fiction, as misinformation can spread rapidly. Discovering and Presenting Evidence: Social media platforms have become treasure troves of information for legal professionals. They can be valuable sources for gathering evidence, especially in cases involving cyberbullying, defamation, or harassment. Pictures, videos, posts, and messages shared on social media can provide crucial insights into an individual\u2019s activities, intentions, or connections.

As such,\u00a0social media is revolutionizing communication\u00a0and access to information on both a national and global scale. Mass distribution and the ability to effortlessly share information has influenced many facets of modern life, changing the way we think about, connect to, and engage with social justice and activism.

The challenge went viral on social media, in part due to its nomination system: Once a person had completed the challenge, they would nominate other individuals to complete it as well.

This current research confirms the inadequacy of this general measure of public opinion by contrasting it with alternative opinion-based measures of court sentencing across specific criminal cases. The article also explores the impact of public\u2019s experiences of the criminal justice system on their opinions about the courts. Having been a victim or attending a criminal case where the punishment was seen as being too lenient seems to cause greater dissatisfaction, whereas contact with people working with victims or who have been in prison improves the level of satisfaction.

Yet, audience selectivity\u2014inherent within today\u2019s high-choice media environments\u2014has largely been disregarded. Relatedly, the predominance of forced-exposure designs is a source of concern. This article proposes the integration of audience selectivity into media stereotype effects research. Study 1 (N\u2009=\u20091,166) indicated that prejudiced individuals tended to approach prejudice-consistent stereotypical news and avoid prejudice-challenging counter-stereotypical news. Using a forced-exposure experiment, study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009380) showed detrimental effects of prejudice-consistent news and beneficial effects of prejudice-challenging news. Relying on a self-selected exposure paradigm, study 3 (N\u2009=\u20091,149) provided evidence for preference-based reinforcement. Study 4\u2019s \u201cnet-effect perspective\u201d (N\u2009=\u2009937) indicated that operationalizing exposure as forced or self-selected can lead to different interpretations of actual societal effects. The findings emphasize the key role played by audience selectivity when studying media effects. The media portray many social categories, such as minority groups, in a stereotypical way (Billings & Parrott, 2020). This is problematic, as media depictions often represent the main, if not the only, source of information for citizens (Ramasubramanian & Murphy, 2014). Previous research has already acknowledged the importance of studying the effects of exposure to media stereotypes on essential outcomes, such as prejudice. This l",

What is the purpose of this tool, launched in 2016 at the ISC-PIF institute of complex systems and successfully deployed during the previous election? David Chavalarias:1 The purpose of the Politoscope is to offer the general public an insightful look at the masses of data generated on the social networks in the run-up to the presidential election, using analytical tools and methods developed by research. The goal is, for one thing, to help put politicians\u2019 statements into clearer context over the long term, and in the short run, to identify collective actions devised to influence public opinion. The project studies all social networks but focuses primarily on Twitter, a medium that is widely used by political figures and their activist bases. It monitors approximately 3,000 elected politicians and party officials, in addition to specific keywords like #pr\u00e9sidentielle2022 or #r\u00e9gionales, scanning 500,000 to 2 million tweets every day. It provides a perspective on the evolution of social groups and alliances between political parties, as well as the information they disseminate. What different types of opinion manipulation have you identified? D. C.: In 2017 we observed three types of manipulation. The most conventional consists in spreading disinformation to influence the vote, most often by denigrating a candidate. At the other end of the spectrum are operations that reveal personal information or internal data concerning a political party just before the ballot, leaving no time to verify the accusations, in the hope of instilling doubt and inducing a segment of the electorate to change their vote.

Advertisement The delayed and combinatorial response of online public opinion to the real world: An inquiry into news texts during the COVID-19 era Humanities and Social Sciences Communications volume\u00a011, Article\u00a0number:\u00a01026 (2024) Cite this article 892 Accesses Metrics details Subjects Abstract In sociological research based on online public opinion, scholars often overlook the delay and combinatory nature of online responses to real-world events. This study aims to explore the delayed and combinatory responses of online public opinion to the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: (a) Is there a temporal delay in the response of online public opinion to the intensity of the pandemic? (b) Does this delay exhibit general characteristics of social networks, such as combinatory effects and higher-order interactions? To address these questions, we employ natural language processing techniques to extract online public opinion data and utilize statistical and machine learning-based causal inference methods for analysis. The findings indicate that online public opinion\u2019s response to the intensity of COVID-19 is not immediate but rather exhibits a long-term lag. Identical COVID-19 intensity data can trigger multiple delayed public opinion responses, while a single delayed public opinion datum may be influenced by multiple preceding COVID-19 intensity data points. This delayed response of online public opinion and its higher-order network characteristics result in a waveform structure of real-world impacts influenced by online public opinion. We also utilized machine learning causal inference techniques to investigate the sensitivity differ",

Social media provides the vehicle for these opinions and enables the spread of ideas faster than ever before. Previous computational models have suggested that significant external events can induce extreme polarization. We introduce the Social Opinion Amplification Model (SOAM) to investigate an alternative hypothesis: that opinion amplification can result in extreme polarization. SOAM models effects such as sensationalism, hype, or \u201cfake news\u201d as people express amplified versions of their actual opinions, motivated by the desire to gain a greater following. We show for the first time that this simple idea results in extreme polarization, especially when the degree of amplification is small. We further show that such extreme polari",

However, little is known about how exposure to artifacts of Echo Chambers, such as biased attitudinally congruent online news feeds, affects individuals\u2019 perceptions and behavior. This study experimentally tested if exposure to attitudinally congruent online news feeds affects individuals' False Consensus Effect, that is, how strongly individuals perceive public opinions as favorably biased and in support of their own opinions. It was predicted that the extent of the False Consensus Effect is influenced by the level of agreement individuals encounter in online news feeds, with high agreement leading to a higher estimate of public support for their own opinions than low agreement. Two online experiments (n1 = 331 and n2 = 207) exposed participants to nine news feeds, each containing four messages. Two factors were manipulated: Agreement expressed in message texts (all but one [Exp.1] / all [Exp.2] messages were congruent or incongruent to participants' attitudes) and endorsement of congruent messages by other users (congruent messages displayed higher or lower numbers of \u201clikes\u201d than incongruent messages). Additionally, based on Elaboration Likelihood Theory, interest in a topic was considered as a moderating variable. Both studies confirmed that participants infer public support for their own attitudes from the degree of agreement they encounter in online messages, yet are skeptical of the validity of \u201clikes\u201d, especially if their interest in a topic is high.

This blog aims to delve into the interplay between social media, legal cases, and public perception, providing insights into the evolving digital landscape that is transforming justice and societal norms. In today's digitally connected world, social media has transformed not only how we communicate but also how we perceive and interpret significant societal events, including legal cases. With the immense power to shape public discourse, the influence of social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram on legal proceedings and public perception is a topic that demands comprehensive exploration. This blog post delves into this pressing issue, shedding light on the complexities of this modern phenomenon. The Rise of Social Media The last two decades have seen the meteoric rise of social media.

Business The Impact of Social Media on Legal Cases in the US US Insider Staff October 25, 2024 9:11 pm Photo: Unsplash.com By: Joshua Finley In the digital age, social media has transformed how we communicate and share information, significantly affecting almost all aspects of life, including legal cases. In the US, the impact of social media on legal proceedings is increasingly prominent. While this article does not offer legal advice we discuss general impacts social media may have on proceedings. Evidence Collection Social media can serve as a double-edged sword in legal cases. On the one hand, it provides a platform for collecting valuable evidence; on the other, it can lead to complications for those involved in a case. Additionally, social media can introduce bias even after jury selection. Jurors may inadvertently encounter trial-related content online, potentially influencing their views despite court instructions to avoid such exposure. Potential Evidence: Posts, photos, and comments on platforms like Facebook and Instagram can be scrutinized during legal proceedings. For instance, if a plaintiff claims to be incapacitated due to an accident but posts pictures engaging in active hobbies, this can significantly undermine their credibility. Potential bias: Attorneys often use social media to assess potential jurors\u2019 backgrounds and opinions, going beyond the limited information disclosed in court. This allows legal teams to make strategic decisions about juror suitability based on a juror\u2019s digital presence. However, this practice raises privacy concerns, as jurors might not expect their online act",

How Cancel Culture and Perp Walks May Undermine Trial Impartiality and Criminal Justice A simple internet search of the term \u2018cancel culture\u2019 produces a series of daily stories on how online shaming has impacted an increasing number of individuals and companies, raising new social and legal questions. The term refers to the practice of withdrawing support or completely rejecting public figures or companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, namely expressed through social media in the form of group shaming [1]. This modern form of ostracism against someone who is \u2018canceled\u2019 depends, above all, on a judgement made in the court of public opinion. Unlike courts within a legally well-established judicial system, courts of public opinion rely on trends and opinions which may or may not be grounded in factual evidence. Nonetheless, judgements in the courts of public opinion are not novel. Cancel culture appears to resemble the practice of perp walk, which is a scheduled public appearance where police officers escort a recently arrested individual in handcuffs through a public area where they can be photographed for the benefit of the media [2]. Especially in the United States, cancel culture and perp walks both open the possibility for the general public to produce its own judgement of the perp before the matter is addressed by the judicial system. This judgement is often facilitated by social media in the case of cancel culture, and it is not guided by any procedural rights o",

Fifteen interdisciplinary teams of political scientists and complex systems theorists in the natural sciences and engineering explored how polarization is produced and influenced over time by the actions and interactions of individual voters, people in power, and various social networks. Ultimately, as social interactions and individual decisions isolate people into only a few intractable camps, the political system becomes incapable of addressing the range of issues \u2014 or formulating the variety of solutions \u2014 necessary for government to function and provide the services critical for society. The studies were published Dec. 6 in a special issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that stemmed from a collaboration between Princeton University and Arizona State University (ASU) and includes several papers led by Princeton researchers. \u201cThe complex systems perspective demonstrates that the loss of diversity associated with polarization undermines cooperation and the ability of societies to provide the public goods that make for a healthy society,\u201d according to an introduction by issue editors Simon Levin, Princeton\u2019s James S.

Abstract There is widespread evidence that individuals select information that supports their convictions and worldviews. This behavior yields the formation of echo chambers - environments in which an individual\u2019s own political beliefs are repeated and amplified and dissenting opinions are screened out. Recent research demonstrates that social networking sites (SNS) such as Facebook or Twitter can facilitate this selection into homogenous networks. Using data from a representative nationwide online survey, we consider the degree to which respondents\u2019 social media networks resemble virtual echo chambers. We then analyze the effect of these social media echo chambers on satisfaction with democracy among Democrats and Republicans in the aftermath of the 2016 U.S. elections. Our findings reveal that virtual echo chambers boost democratic satisfaction among Republicans but they do not have an effect on system support by self-identified Democrats. Our paper therefore adds to a growing literature linking online behaviors to mass attitudes about politics.

However, online information can be biased and thereby mislead decision-makers. Combining data from a survey of judges and a national population survey, this article provides evidence that i) Chinese judges rely on online public opinion to infer public attitudes toward the death penalty, ii) online information is biased \u2013 online opinion is more punitive than the general public opinion, and, iii) biased online information seems to have a strong influence on judges\u2019 perception of strong public support for the death penalty, and this may explain why Chinese scholars, lawyers, and other practitioners have persistently overestimated public punitiveness. The findings reveal a less discussed peril of the internet echo chamber: its misleading effect on the information collection process of the government, especially in autocracies. Introduction The idea of an \u201cinternet echo chamber\u201d is a metaphorical way to describe a situation where only certain ideas, information and beliefs are shared online among the people (Jamieson and Cappella, 2008; Sunstein, 2009).

Although determining guilt outside of courtrooms is not new, the ease with which media outlets can pursue people online is somewhat unique. This winter, legal conferences in 2022 will highlight the role of social media in today's legal decisions. Trial By Media - What Is It? Before a court of law renders a decision, a high-profile figure accused of a crime is determined guilty or innocent by television or newspaper coverage. Such incidents have been exacerbated by social media and the 'cancel culture,' in which anyone, despite limited access to facts, can determine and publicly state whether they believe a person is guilty and then demand that person be 'canceled.' 'Cancelling' often translates to getting fired, frequently inciting widespread hatred and 'trolling' against the person, the organization, or even a community. In dictating the trial, a wide section of the public effectively becomes the judge, the jury in deciding their fate, and the executioner regarding their career and reputation. Why Is It Dangerous?

                  "raw_content": " How Social Media Impacts Criminal Cases Social Media as Evidence in Criminal Investigations Admissibility of Social Media Content In the digital age, social media content has become a treasure trove of potential evidence in criminal investigations. However, not all tweets, posts, or snaps can make their way into a courtroom. The admissibility of such content hinges on several legal criteria that mirror the traditional rules of evidence. For instance, the evidence must be relevant to the case, not overly prejudicial, and must have a foundation of authenticity. Courts are increasingly faced with the task of navigating these criteria in the context of rapidly evolving technology. This means scrutinizing the source of the information, the manner in which it was obtained, and its integrity from the point of collection to presentation in court. Challenges in Authenticating Digital Evidence Authenticating digital evidence, particularly from social media, poses unique challenges. Unlike physical evidence, digital data can be easily manipulated, altered, or fabricated. Legal professionals must demonstrate a chain of custody and verify that the content is what it purports to be. This often involves complex forensic processes and expert testimony. Moreover, the ephemeral nature of certain social media content, like Instagram stories or Snapchat messages that disappear after a short period, adds another layer of difficulty in proving that the evidence is genuine and unaltered. Defense and prosecution teams alike must navigate these hurdles to effectively use social media content in their legal strategies. Impact of Social Media on Jury Selection and Bias Pre-Trial Publicity and Juror Impartiality Social media's omnipresence has dramatically shifted the landscape of pre-trial publicity, raising concerns about the ability to maintain juror impartiality. Potential jurors, often active on various social platforms, may be exposed to case details, opinions, and community sentiments that could influence their perceptions before se",

(Part One of a Two Part Discussion) Written By: J. Paul Zimmerman, Esq. Christian & Small Birmingham, AL In the current age of digital and social media, juror use of social media is perhaps one of the greatest concerns facing courts and litigants. In Part 1 of this two-part series, Christian & Small Partner J. Paul Zimmerman provides a technical introduction to what social media is and how it works, before discussing in Part 2 some of the problems associated with juror use of social media, including juror misconduct, disregard for courts\u2019 instructions, and impartiality. Social media has been around in some form for several decades, but usage soared in the early 2000s with the creation of Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest and blogs. And these social media sites can potentially affect every trial. Today, social media is frequently the subject of discovery, and attorneys must contend with social media in the courtroom \u2013 both in terms of evidence being introduced and with the increasing prevalence of jurors commenting about trial proceedings through their cell phones. And the younger the user, the greater the likelihood of online connectivity. Judges and lawyers who do not use Facebook and do not tweet must still have the ability to address juror perspectives regarding social media and its use. It is widely recognized that the same rules and requirements of evidence apply to digital communications\u2014but the courts still wrestle with the increasing frequency of jurors communicating through social media during trial and about trial proceedings.

Abstract When deliberating, jurors may introduce misinformation that may influence other jurors\u2019 memory and decision-making. In two studies, we explored the impact of misinformation exposure during jury deliberation. Participants in both studies read a transcript of an alleged sexual assault. In Study 1 (N\u2009=\u2009275), participants encountered either consistent pro-prosecution misinformation, consistent pro-defense misinformation, or contradictory misinformation (pro-prosecution and pro-defense). In Study 2 (N\u2009=\u2009339), prior to encountering either pro-prosecution or pro-defense misinformation while reading a jury deliberation t",

It is vital for schools to provide students with a solid education on media and information literacy as part of the curriculum. Teachers must be well-trained in the subject to empower students with the necessary competences to critically understand and assess information reported by all forms of media. Projects in partnership with national and local authorities and media organisations are encouraged. Facts & figures Two thirds of EU citizens report coming across fake news at least once a week.[1] Over 80% of EU citizens say they see fake news both as an issue for their country and for democracy in general.[2] Half of EU citizens aged 15-30 say they need critical thinking and information skills to help them combat fake news and extremism in society.[3] What is propaganda, misinformation and fake news? The terms \u2018propaganda\u2019, \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018fake news\u2019 often overlap in meaning. They are used to refer to a range of ways in which sharing information causes harm, intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 usually in relation to the promotion of a particular moral or political cause or point of view. It is possible to separate out three clearly different uses of information which fall into this category: Although none of these phenomena are new, they have taken on new significance recently with the widespread availability of sophisticated forms of information and communication technology. The sharing of text, images, videos, or links online, for example, allows information to go viral within hours. Why is propaganda, misinformation and fake news important at school?

Although some argue misinformation is as old as communication itself, the debate around its causes and impact has grown in recent years thanks to the role it has played in political campaigns, how it has amplified or stoked ethnic tensions around the world, and how it has muddied scientific consensus and health interventions. While misinformation problems are driven by political and social forces that vary from country to country, they are also rooted both in broader changes across the media environment and in efforts by various actors to use and abuse digital technologies. Given this, researchers at the Reuters Institute for the study of Journalism have been investigating the ways in which media outlets and technologies shape, mediate, and reflect misinformation problems. This post provides a short overview of key research from the Reuters Institute that has addressed global misinformation problems. The role of social media and search engines Rather than accessing news organisations directly, people are increasingly discovering news content through social media and search (see Figure 1). Despite some variation, this pattern is observed across countries. Our findings document the central role that platforms are now playing in the distribution of online content\u2014both information and misinformation. People sometimes engage directly with sources of misinformation. But they can also arrive at misinformation (as they arrive at much else) side-ways via search engines, social media, or other forms of distributed discovery.

Not only can belief in misinformation lead to poor judgements and decision-making, it also exerts a lingering influence on people\u2019s reasoning after it has been corrected \u2014 an effect known as the continued influence effect. In this Review, we describe the cognitive, social and affective factors that lead people to form or endorse misinformed views, and the psychological barriers to knowledge revision after misinformation has been corrected, including theories of continued influence. We discuss the effectiveness of both pre-emptive (\u2018prebunking\u2019) and reactive (\u2018debunking\u2019) interventions to reduce the effects of misinformation, as well as implications for information consumers and practitioners in various areas including journalism, public health, policymaking and education. Introduction Misinformation \u2014 which we define as any information that turns out to be false \u2014 poses an inevitable challenge for human cognition and social interaction because it is a consequence of the fact that people frequently err and sometimes lie1. However, this fact is insufficient to explain the rise of misinformation, and its subsequent influence on memory and decision-making, as a major challenge in the twenty-first century2,3,4.

In a recent talk I gave at the University of Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, I discussed my experience with cancel culture, the techniques it employs, its intellectual background, and its political impact. At the time, I briefly touched on the psychology and social psychology of cancelation. My intention in this essay is to use my own experience with cancelation to take a deeper look at the psychology of cancel culture. One of the most recurrent themes in cancelation is the effort by the cancelers, and their allies, to obtain a statement of guilt or apology from the target as a means of holding the victim \u201caccountable.\u201d What is also surprisingly recurrent is the target\u2019s eventual willingness to provide such a statement, even though the target may not believe the alleged harm requires an apology.

How Cancel Culture and Perp Walks May Undermine Trial Impartiality and Criminal Justice A simple internet search of the term \u2018cancel culture\u2019 produces a series of daily stories on how online shaming has impacted an increasing number of individuals and companies, raising new social and legal questions. The term refers to the practice of withdrawing support or completely rejecting public figures or companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, namely expressed through social media in the form of group shaming [1]. This modern form of ostracism against someone who is \u2018canceled\u2019 depends, above all, on a judgement made in the court of public opinion. Unlike courts within a legally well-established judicial system, courts of public opinion rely on trends and opinions which may or may not be grounded in factual evidence. Nonetheless, judgements in the courts of public opinion are not novel. Cancel culture appears to resemble the practice of perp walk, which is a scheduled public appearance where police officers escort a recently arrested individual in handcuffs through a public area where they can be photographed for the benefit of the media [2]. Especially in the United States, cancel culture and perp walks both open the possibility for the general public to produce its own judgement of the perp before the matter is addressed by the judicial system. This judgement is often facilitated by social media in the case of cancel culture, and it is not guided by any procedural rights o",

Dave Olsen Follow Extra Newsfeed -- 3 Share There are three situations where you might find yourself being \u201ccancelled\u201d. One situation is where someone has committed a crime, usually violent or otherwise serious. This is where cancel culture started life \u2014 as a fairly innocent and useful mechanism for exposing those who evaded tax or committed violent crimes while evading the criminal justice system. The Paradise Papers, the exposition of acts of police brutality, even early murmurings about the child sex ring of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell \u2014 these are all prime examples of the success that cancel culture had at first. There is a legitimate argument that the efforts of activists in this regard would be better channelled into judicial reform. But, in many countries, including, sadly, the United States, judicial reform is a difficult process, as are many other types of political reform. Exposing the crimes of celebrities, the powerful, and the wealthy is an effective way to hold them to account, even if people shouldn\u2019t be left feeling as though they need to do this. -- -- 3 Published in Extra Newsfeed the same political rants you see on Facebook, but they're well written.

According to Statista , it was found that, as of September 2017, the typical American spent an average of 721 minutes per day consuming media. Of this number, U.S. adults spent an average of 123 minutes on laptop or desktop activities, while the daily reach of television was estimated to be roughly 75 percent of the population. Given this huge amount of interaction with media combined with the reach of television, major news stories, like those of high-profile trials, influence public opinion and, in certain cases, potentially even the jury itself. Here are a few examples of such trials where media may have played a role in the outcome. Traditional Media - The Aileen Wuornos Case Aileen Wuornos, branded as America's first female serial killer by the media (a label used as the defining theme of her trial coverage), is a prime example of media coverage and influence. Media coverage of her crimes helped sway the public against her, painting her in the image of a 'man-hating murderer' before the case was closed. Although her story around the murders changed frequently, she held constant her belief that the media had created a bias against her. Prior to her initial trial, she requested a change of venue due to the publicity already surrounding her case. This was denied. After the initial trial, she claimed that the media coverage was out to get her, leading to her being found guilty. In some ways, it was not the media itself but the drive by various individuals surrounding the case to gain publicity and money that may have affected the outcome of Aileen Wuornos' trials.

Our research project DigitalDialog21 aims at evaluating the effects of digital change on society and how digital change, and the risks and possibilities that come with it, is perceived by the population. Digital change is underst ood as a factor of social change in this project. By investigating digital change and its effects on society, we are able to draw more general inferences on how societies change socially and what needs to be done in education to establish digital trust. In 2017 the Digital Evolution Index observed an increasing trust deficit and skepticism towards digitalization in both very industrialized and lesser industrialized countries. We will draw inferences from these observations here and hypothesize the followin g: It seems that especially in marginalized communities, that is: in communities that are structurally and systemically disadvantaged and that experience societal marginalization, this trust deficit and skepticism towards digitalization is prevalent. This could be so because, as a member of a marginalized community, one might quickly find issues resulting from marginalization to be present in digital spaces just like they are present in non -digital spaces. This paper will examine critically how attitudes in marginalized communities towards digital media are influenced by digital change. Do the risks of digitalization outweigh the advantages for marginalized communities? Are digital media perceived to provide advantages such as increased visibility and re",

The Use of Digital Media for Social Mobilization in Marginalized Communities: The Case of a Mayan Socioenvironmental Movement in Guatemala KARINA J. GARCIA-RUANO 1 Michigan State University ALEJANDRO PACHECO Universidad Rafael Land\u00edvar de Guatemala DESSIREE SUAZO Universidad Rafael Land\u00edvar de Guatemala Introduction This article examines the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for political mobilization in marginalized populations of a developing country. Recent studies put forward the potential of ICTs in building networks and mobilizing power (Castells, 2007a; Juris, 2008; Sassen, 2004). However, there is scarce empirical research on how, why, and with what results this network communication power is possible in the context of traditionally excluded populations within social structures such as those in the Third World. Using multisited ethnographic research (Marcus, 1995), this investigation develops a case study examining how an environmental social movement led by Mayan rural communities uses ICTs to protest against the mining and extractive industries in the Western highlands of Guatemala. In the last decade, the developing world saw a number of cases in which communities on the periphery organized social movements to challenge their governments about the environmental and human development costs of irresponsible exploitation of natural resources (e.g., Akpalu & Parks, 2007; Holden & Jacobson, 2007; Imbun, 2006; Root, Wiley, & Peek, 2002). Particularly in Latin America, indigenous populations have organized movements against mining and extractive industries (Perreault, 2012; Pieck, 2006; Ulloa, 2001; Van de Sandt, 2009; Whiteman & Mamen, 2002)",

Recent studies have linked the regular use of digital platforms with higher rates of anxiety and depression among both teens and adults; an increase in eating disorders among adolescent girls; a decline in cognitive function resulting from sleep disruptions; and diminished confidence in American democracy due to the proliferation of \u201cfake news.\u201d \u00a0 Considering that an estimated 4.9 billion people worldwide, or roughly 60% of the entire global population, use social media \u2014 and for an average of 2 hours and 31 minutes every day \u2014 it\u2019s clear that digital networks pose significant and serious risks to users\u2019 physical and psychological health.\u00a0 David Stamps doesn\u2019t dispute social media\u2019s harmful potential, but he believes the medium also has the capacity to educate, inspire and empower, particularly for Black Americans.

Some 35% of Americans have experienced harassment online this year due to racial, religious, or sexual identity \u2013 an increase of 3% from 2018, according to a study released Tuesday by the Anti-Defamation League. Religion-based harassment in particular increased to 22% in 2020, up from 11% in 2018. \u201cIt is by definition difficult to be part of a marginalized group, and that is as true in the online world as it is in the real world,\u201d said Jonathan A Greenblatt, the CEO of the ADL. Online harassment is not only increasing but intensifying, with 28% of Americans now saying they have experienced \u201csevere\u201d online hate this year, including sexual harassment, stalking, physical threats, or sustained harassment. The survey was conducted prior to several of the major news events of 2020, including the coronavirus pandemic and the death of George Floyd, Greenblatt noted. Were the survey to be held again now, he says, the results could be even more alarming. \u201cWe believe that if the same survey were conducted today even more people might report negative online experiences,\u201d he said. \u201cSevere online harassment was a significant problem before, and in our current climate, it\u2019s even more important for platforms and policymakers to take action.\u201d The vast majority (77%) of harassment took place on Facebook, the survey found. That is a significant increase from 2018, when 56% of harassment occurred on the social network.

There is growing anxiety over this practice of publicly shaming people online for violating social norms ranging from inappropriate jokes to controversial business practices. Online shaming can be a wildly disproportionate response that violates the privacy of the shamed while offering them no good way to defend themselves. These consequences lead some critics to claim that online shaming creates a \u201chate storm\u201d that destroys lives and reputations, leaves targets with \u201cpermanent digital baggage\u201d and threatens the fundamental right to publicly express yourself in a democracy. As a result, some scholars have declared that online shaming is a \u201cmoral wrong and social ill.\u201d But is online public shaming necessarily negative? I\u2019m a political scientist who studies the relationship between digital technologies and democracy. In my research, I show how public shaming can be a valuable tool for democratic accountability. However, it is more likely to provide these positive effects within a clearly defined community whose members have many overlapping connections. When shaming helps Public shaming is a \u201chorizontal\u201d form of social sanctioning, in which people hold one another responsible for violating social norms, rather than appealing to higher authorities to do so. This makes it especially useful in democratic societies, as well as in cases where the shamers face power imbalances or lack access to formal authorities that could hold the shamed accountable. For example, public shaming can be an effective strategy for challenging corporate power and behavior or maintaining journalistic norms in the face of plagiarism. By harnessing social pressure, public",

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes. Variations in conditions presented,",

Abstract While a growing number of studies have documented significant links between online racism (e.g., racist interactions, contents on racial violence) and comorbid factors (e.g., depression) associated with suicide risk, no studies have examined whether online racism predicts suicide ideation and if interpersonal factors can help explain this link. Thus, the current study examined the direct relationship between online racism and suicide ideation among racial minority emerging adults, and the indirect relationships via the interpersonal factors (perceived burdensomeness and thwarted belongingness). Using data from a convenience sample of 338 racial minority emerging adults, we conducted a path analysis with online racism predicting suicide ideation through thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness. Online racism significantly predicted suicid",

The Use of Digital Media for Social Mobilization in Marginalized Communities: The Case of a Mayan Socioenvironmental Movement in Guatemala KARINA J. GARCIA-RUANO 1 Michigan State University ALEJANDRO PACHECO Universidad Rafael Land\u00edvar de Guatemala DESSIREE SUAZO Universidad Rafael Land\u00edvar de Guatemala Introduction This article examines the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) for political mobilization in marginalized populations of a developing country. Recent studies put forward the potential of ICTs in building networks and mobilizing power (Castells, 2007a; Juris, 2008; Sassen, 2004). However, there is scarce empirical research on how, why, and with what results this network communication power is possible in the context of traditionally excluded populations within social structures such as those in the Third World. Using multisited ethnographic research (Marcus, 1995), this investigation develops a case study examining how an environmental social movement led by Mayan rural communities uses ICTs to protest against the mining and extractive industries in the Western highlands of Guatemala. In the last decade, the developing world saw a number of cases in which communities on the periphery organized social movements to challenge their governments about the environmental and human development costs of irresponsible exploitation of natural resources (e.g., Akpalu & Parks, 2007; Holden & Jacobson, 2007; Imbun, 2006; Root, Wiley, & Peek, 2002). Particularly in Latin America, indigenous populations have organized movements against mining and extractive industries (Perreault, 2012; Pieck, 2006; Ulloa, 2001; Van de Sandt, 2009; Whiteman & Mamen, 2002)",

Our research project DigitalDialog21 aims at evaluating the effects of digital change on society and how digital change, and the risks and possibilities that come with it, is perceived by the population. Digital change is underst ood as a factor of social change in this project. By investigating digital change and its effects on society, we are able to draw more general inferences on how societies change socially and what needs to be done in education to establish digital trust. In 2017 the Digital Evolution Index observed an increasing trust deficit and skepticism towards digitalization in both very industrialized and lesser industrialized countries. We will draw inferences from these observations here and hypothesize the followin g: It seems that especially in marginalized communities, that is: in communities that are structurally and systemically disadvantaged and that experience societal marginalization, this trust deficit and skepticism towards digitalization is prevalent. This could be so because, as a member of a marginalized community, one might quickly find issues resulting from marginalization to be present in digital spaces just like they are present in non -digital spaces. This paper will examine critically how attitudes in marginalized communities towards digital media are influenced by digital change. Do the risks of digitalization outweigh the advantages for marginalized communities? Are digital media perceived to provide advantages such as increased visibility and re",

This study examined how digital information influences knowledge, practices, threat appraisals, and motivation behaviors of urban marginalized communities. It examined slum people\u2019s digital competencies, their access to COVID-19 online information, and their trust in COVID-19 information provided by both online and offline media. A total of 453 slum people in Bangkok city, Thailand were surveyed, and multiple regression was performed to examine whether socio-demographic factors influence the access to online communication of slum people. We hypothesized that access to online information might affect marginalized people\u2019s awareness of COVID-19 and resulted in greater levels of their practices and protective behaviors. The finding showed that slum people who had access to online information tended to have a better awareness of self-protection against COVID-19, while elderly, female, and foreign migrant workers faced a number of constraints in accessing COVID-19 online information.

Just one-in-ten Americans say social media sites have a mostly positive effect on the way things are going, and one-quarter say these platforms have a neither positive nor negative effect. Those who have a negative view of the impact of social media mention, in particular, misinformation and the hate and harassment they see on social media. They also have concerns about users believing everything they see or read \u2013 or not being sure about what to believe. Additionally, they bemoan social media\u2019s role in fomenting partisanship and polarization, the creation of echo chambers, and the perception that these platforms oppose President Donald Trump and conservatives. This is part of a series of posts on Americans\u2019 experiences with and attitudes about the role of social media in politics today. Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how Americans think about the impact of social media on the way things are currently going in the country. To explore this, we surveyed 10,211 U.S. adults from July 13 to 19, 2020.

The media portrays marginalized communities through stereotypes and limited representation. These stereotypes can shape audience judgments, emotions and public policy opinions while it has some negative impacts including, self- concept, self- esteem and collective identity of communities of color. Media has a significant influence on society, shaping people\u2019s perception, values and behavior. Media can manipulate. SOCIO- CULTURAL IMPACT OF MEDIA ON MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES The positive impact of using new technologies to built networks and traditional structures can be structured by social context in which mobilization occurs. The potential of digital media to empower population trigger certain communicative characteristics that enhance mobilization like civil engagement, reinforcing patterns. The marginalized communities are depicted negative in media, which can reinforce stereotypes, limit access to resources and intergroup relationships. The lack of diverse voices in media reflected online which can contribute to remove marginalized communities. Traditional form of communication can be integrated with other media such as TV, radio etc. Sometimes social media are means for marginalized individuals or groups to address insufficient resources and barriers. For example, social media has been implicated in new opportunities for building social capital finding like- minded others providing social support and engagement in advocacy. It also highlights the short- comings of social media use for marginalized as well as harassment and discrimination and social media use by people to isolate the marginalized. These opportunities affect the marginalized people\u2019s use of social media access, skills, development of features,",

The relationship between media and public perception is intricate and multifaceted, encompassing various forms of communication, including traditional outlets like newspapers and television, as well as digital platforms such as social media. This dynamic interplay influences how individuals interpret events, understand societal issues, and form opinions about the world around them. As society becomes increasingly interconnected through technology, the role of media in shaping perceptions has grown more significant, raising questions about the accuracy, fairness, and responsibility of media entities. The evolution of media has transformed the way information is disseminated and consumed. In the past, a limited number of newspapers and broadcast stations dominated the landscape, providing a relatively uniform narrative to the public. However, the advent of the internet and social media has democratized information dissemination, allowing diverse voices to emerge. This shift has not only expanded the range of perspectives available to the public but has also complicated the process of discerning credible information from misinformation. As a result, understanding the influence of media on public perception is crucial for navigating the complexities of modern society. Key Takeaways Media plays a crucial role in shaping public perception by influencing the way people perceive and understand various issues. The influence of media on public opinion is significant, as it has the power to shape and mold the views and beliefs of the general public.

Learn More The Psychology of Cancel Culture: Impacts on Mental Health LinkedInFacebookTwitter Cancel Culture in DC: Unpacking Its Mental Health Implications In recent years, the term \u2018cancel culture\u2019 has risen to the forefront of societal discourse, particularly in Washington, DC. At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles \u2013 either online, in the real world, or both. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Societal Implications of Cancel Culture The Rise of Cancel Culture: Social, Cultural, and Technological Factors Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there\u2019s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals\u2019 actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These plat",

Jun 19, 2024 / Written by: Gary Isbell Cancel culture, once a dominant force on social media and public discourse, is now showing serious signs of wear. This trend involves calling out and boycotting individuals or organizations for perceived wrongdoings. It is losing its grip on the collective consciousness. Public opinion has long understood that grave social evils must be called out and suppressed. However, the left seeks to cancel any and everything that opposes the unbridled liberty to gratify passions and foment class struggle. People have grown weary of this practice. Public Opinion is Tired of Polarization Leftists relish polarization, strife and conflict because it is consistent with a philosophy that divides society into the oppressors and the oppressed. Cancel culture serves as a tool to aid in the destruction of \u201coppressive\u201d structures like the family, Christian traditions and the free market. Many now recognize that cancel culture often leads to unwarranted attacks and long-lasting damage upon society rather than fostering constructive change. This awareness prompts a rejection of the emotional frenzy that erupts when anyone disagrees with liberal talking points. Indeed, cancel culture has thrived on creating stark divisions without any reference to a moral compass that defines good and evil, reality and fantasy or objectivity and subjectivity. Everything is relative, and each person defines truth, goodness and beauty. This thinking divides society and makes fact-based, logical and intelligent debates impossible. Recent studies reveal that constant outrage and divisiveness in the media is causing public fatigue. Most Americans beli",

Shakuntala\u2019s forthcoming book, co-authored with Ram Bhat \u2013 Social Media and Hate \u2013 demonstrates how forms of identity and self-expression are punished through a range of hateful and dehumanising practices on and offline. It also analyses the links between histories of discriminatory violence and the vitriolic trolling of political activists, scholars and ordinary social media users who are outspoken about equality and justice. What is \u2018cancelling\u2019 and the implications of using the term In April 2021, only months before the Euro2020 finals would precipitate an avalanche of public racism against the young Black players in the England team, leading to calls for racist fans to be \u2018banned\u2019 from matches, I participated in my colleague Paul Dolan\u2019s Duck-Rabbit podcast for an episode entitled \u2018Freedom of Speech\u2019. During the discussion, the phrase \u2018cancel culture\u2019 was used at various points as a proxy for unfair political censorship and at others it was equated with bullying \u2013 the implication being that those being cancelled were \u2018underdogs\u2019. We had a fierce debate about the history and the practices associated with the term and the attitudes and values which might trigger what has come to be called \u201ccancelling\u201d or \u201ccalling out\u201d. Yet, we barely touched the tip of the iceberg around the politicisation of \u2018free speech\u2019 and disingenuous weaponization of the term by rightwing and far right individuals and organisations.

Multiple white women approached me afterwards about their fears to address privilege within their communities or online businesses. One of the comments that stuck out the most was made by a white woman who seemed genuinely interested in being an ally to women of color. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that if I say or ask the wrong thing, I\u2019ll\u2026get\u2026cancelled,\u201d she quietly admitted. I spent the next few days thinking about what it means to be \u201ccanceled,\u201d specifically how it\u2019s causing people to live in shame and denial as a way of self-preservation \u2014 an effort to diminish their chances of being called out. And while I have my own views on white spiritual feminism, it appears to be too easy for most white women to disregard the suffering of people of color. We live in an era where we expect \u201cwokeness\u201d from our peers, the cultural expectation to be socially aware, particularly in what we speak up against. If you aren\u2019t \u201cwoke,\u201d you\u2019re at risk of being \u201ccancelled,\u201d or experience a certain level of \u201cwoke bashing.\u201d Cancel culture has infiltrated the very fabric of our society, so much so that some people, like the woman who came up to me in Santa Cruz, are afraid to learn, engage, and speak up. You can\u2019t read the news or flip through a gossip magazine without reading about a celebrity losing a TV show or brand partnership deal (effectively being \u201ccancelled\u201d) as a result of problematic behavior.

Arline Geronimus\u2019 \u201cWeathering: The Extraordinary Stress of Ordinary Life in an Unjust Society,\u201d examines the impact of injustice on the health of structurally marginalized populations. The renowned public health researcher delves into the mental health impact of micro- and macroaggressions, discrimination and oppression on communities dealing with sustained hardship. Historically marginalized communities often do not seek care, especially for mental health, and may have limited access to care given these inequities. Imagine how the impact of bias is heightened when you are sick or vulnerable. Active self-care, attention to well-being, and recipes for healthy living are critical to anyone\u2019s overall physical and mental well-being.

Bridging the gap: Mental health equity in the digital age How digital care can help close the care gap in marginalized communities. George Floyd's murder, the Atlanta spa shooting, the Pulse nightclub attack \u00e2\u0080\u0094 these heart-wrenching stories flash across our screens, only to be quickly replaced by the next headline. But for marginalized communities, the mental scars of hate crimes linger long after the news cycle moves on. Following George Floyd's death, for example, depression and anxiety among Black Americans rose to 41.69% compared to 37.97% for white Americans based on a 2020-2021 survey. And while marginalized communities tend to be more heavily affected by mental health challenges, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re also less likely to receive mental healthcare. A Kaiser Family Foundation report found that among adults reporting moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety, depression, or both, mental health treatment rates were lowest among young adults, Black adults, men, and uninsured people. In short, mental health is not equitable.\u00c2\u00a0 Let's examine the barriers to mental health equity and explore solutions to ensure care reaches those most in need. The mental health crisis in marginalized communities Hate crimes and collective trauma inflict undeniable harm on communities, but these are far from the only factors impacting well-being. Many marginalized groups also face persistent socioeconomic challenges that contribute to their mental health struggles. For one, financial hardship is a stark reality for many, and these struggles often go hand-in-hand with mental illness. Plus, the ongoing experience of discrimination and systemic racism can add race-related stressors, linked to an increased risk of mental health conditions. Limited access to care worsens the cycle, as mental health disparities disproportionately impact people of color, who often experience more severe and lasting mental illness due to less and lower-quality care.

This phenom- enon of so -called \u2018online public shaming\u2019 could provide a powerful tool for reinforcing valuable social norms. B ut it also threatens unwarranted and severe punishments meted out by online mobs. Drawing on the work of John Locke, as well as on recent discussions of social norms, we analyze the dangers associated with the informal enforcement of norms, but also highli ght the promise of this practice. We then consider two cru- cial conditions that online public shaming must meet in order to be justi- fiable: proportionality and accountability. We argue that these require- ments are in fact frequently violated, rendering most cases of online pub- lic shaming unjustified. While the use of online public shaming against others\u2019 vices has some apparent virtues, it is currently rarely justified, given its own vices.

The Internet affords un precedented opportunities to critici ze those we consider to have done wrong. Ill -advised tweets, photos, and Facebook posts regularly go viral and attract streams of criticism. Moreover, individuals regularly take to the Internet to denounce conduct they h ave observed offline, and appeal to others to j oin them in their condemnation. The list of (in)famous cases of online public shaming gets longer by the month \u2013 from the very early case of \u201cdog poop girl\u201d 1 to a more recent example in which a video of a customer racially abusing a post office employee in London was put on Facebook and attracted nearly a million views. 2 Many of those who have been the target of this kind of online public sham- ing have fa",

Supporters of online shaming argue that it is an important tool in helping to make social media and online communities safer and more welcoming to traditionally marginal ized groups. Objections to shaming often sound like high-minded calls for civility, but this chapter argues that shaming behaviour poses serious risks. It identifies the moral and po litical risks of online shaming. In particular, shaming threatens to undermine our commit ment to the co-deliberative practices of morality. As a result, online shaming can under mine the very goals it is supposed to accomplish. Keywords: online shaming ,social media ,shame ,co-deliberation ,racism ,sexism Introduction Shaming practices are not new. Evidence of shaming practices can be found in ancient and pre-modern societies in many parts of the globe ( Stearns 2017 : ch. 2). Given shaming\u2019s long history, the prevalence of online shaming should not be surprising. The technology involved has shifted quickly and sometimes dramatically, but online shaming seems to follow it wherever it goes. Chatrooms, fan forums, blogs, and social media plat forms can all provide examples of shaming. It seems that as long as we have been online, we have been finding ways to digitally shame each other.

The digital world offers a useful medium for female empowerment and community building, amplifying the voices of marginalized populations globally. However, social media and online spaces can also be used to exacerbate gender-based online harassment and proliferate structural gender-based violence through disinformation, cyberharassment, cyberstalking, sextortion, recruitment for sex trafficking, revenge porn and threats of physical assault. The perpetrator-victim dynamic changes drastically in an online context, permitting perpetrators to hide behind the anonymity of the internet. Online violence is pervasive and has profound implications for the ability of women, girls and other marginalized individuals to exist safely in digital spaces. Marginalized groups \u2014 including women, gender minoritized groups, LGBTQ+ persons and people with disabilities \u2014 are the most vulnerable to coordinated violence in an online context. Gender-based online abuse is far more prevalent in regions with diminished social and political protections for women and girls. The lessened social status of victims of gender-based online harassment means that there is often little legal or protective recourse for them. According to the United Nations, approximately 40% of all solicitation and recruitment for sex trafficking begins on social media, which markedly increased with the COVID-19 pandemic. Through social media platforms and online chat platforms, predatory actors can more easily solicit in-person interaction with young",

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes.

REUTERS/Leah Millis 1. Introduction and key findings There is no single trust problem, and therefore there is no single trust solution. This point has been a common refrain over the course of the past two and a half years of the Reuters Institute Trust in News Project. As audiences often have different reasons underlying their scepticism and distrust, news organisations that seek to maintain and rebuild trust must first grapple with whose trust they seek to engender and consider the distinct trade-offs associated with catering to different segments of the public (Toff et al. 2020; Toff et al. 2021a). It is not possible to be trusted by all people, nor are all people looking for journalists to serve them and their communities in the same ways, even if in the abstract there are many shared values around what constitutes trustworthy journalism. This lesson was at the forefront of our minds as we set out in this study to consider the distinct perspectives of audiences who are particularly underrepresented in news coverage and/or hail from historically marginalised groups. Previous survey research, including our own, has shown differences in trust levels and perceptions of fairness in some places based on particular demographic variables, such as race (or caste in India), gender, social class, and age (Newman et al. 2021; Toff et al. 2021c). However, there are limitations to using survey data to understand many of these smaller subsamples. To gain a more granular understanding of what these differences mean and how they may relate to other factors or experiences, qualitative methods are particularly useful.

Received 2014 Oct 28; Revised 2015 Aug 30; Accepted 2015 Sep 8; Issue date 2016 Jun. Abstract Online research methodologies may serve as an important mechanism for population-focused data collection in social work research. Online surveys have become increasingly prevalent in research inquiries with young people and have been acknowledged for their potential in investigating understudied and marginalized populations and subpopulations, permitting increased access to communities that tend to be less visible\u2014and thus often less studied\u2014in offline contexts. Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) young people are a socially stigmatized, yet digitally active, youth population whose participation in online surveys has been previously addressed in the literature. Many of the opportunities and challenges of online survey research identified with LGBTQ youths may be highly relevant to other populations of marginalized and hard-to-access young people, who are likely present in significant numbers in the online environment (for example, ethnoracialized youths and low-income youths). In this article, the utility of online survey methods with marginalized young people is discussed, and recommendations for social work research are provided.

Just one-in-ten Americans say social media sites have a mostly positive effect on the way things are going, and one-quarter say these platforms have a neither positive nor negative effect. Those who have a negative view of the impact of social media mention, in particular, misinformation and the hate and harassment they see on social media. They also have concerns about users believing everything they see or read \u2013 or not being sure about what to believe. Additionally, they bemoan social media\u2019s role in fomenting partisanship and polarization, the creation of echo chambers, and the perception that these platforms oppose President Donald Trump and conservatives. This is part of a series of posts on Americans\u2019 experiences with and attitudes about the role of social media in politics today. Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand how Americans think about the impact of social media on the way things are currently going in the country. To explore this, we surveyed 10,211 U.S. adults from July 13 to 19, 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses.

Studies on hate crime in general show that such crimes are associated with a significantly higher feeling of insecurity, but there is little evidence concerning feeling of insecurity due to online hate speech. Based on a secondary data analysis of a representative population survey in Lower Saxony, Germany, on the topic of cybercrime in 2020 (N\u2009=\u20094,102), we tested three hypotheses regarding the effect of offline and online hate speech on feelings of insecurity. As a result, compared to non-victims, victims of online hate speech exhibit a more pronounced feeling of insecurity outside the Internet, while victims of other forms of cybercrime do not differ in this regard from non-victims. We found no effect for offline hate speech when relevant control variables were included in the statistical model. Possible reasons for this finding are assumed to lie in the characteristics of the phenomenon of online hate speech, for example, because the hateful content spreads uncontrollably on the Internet and reaches its victims even in protected private spheres. Introduction While the Internet has become a seemingly indispensable part of our lives, its digital landscape has also given rise to new challenges. With the growing importance of digital communication, online hate speech has increased sharply in recent years (Costello et al., 2017; \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103 & Buf, 2021). Hate speech is defined as a verbal attack against a certain group of people with a common characteristic, such as race, gender, ethnic group, religion, or political preference (Casta\u00f1o-Pulgar\u00edn et al., 2021). Due to the perpetrators' (perceived) prejudicial motives, hate speech is a form of \"Group-Related Misant",

According to the Special Rapporteur on Minorities Issues\u2019 thematic report 70 per cent or more of those targeted by hate crimes or hate speech in social media are minorities. In addition to being the main targets of hate speech, the report says members of minority groups are also more likely to be affected by restrictions and/or removals by social media content moderation systems. Recent incidents of hate speech, including racist slurs and even incitement to violence or genocide, reflect a global and worrisome trend targeting minority groups as diverse as the Igbo people in northern Nigeria, the Rohingya in Myanmar, the Roma and the Sinti in Europe, or People of African descent, among many others. This trend has been exacerbated by extremist groups and populist figures worldwide who have used the COVID-19 pandemic to promote anti-minority narratives, disinformation and conspiracy theories.

Advertisement From online hate speech to offline hate crime: the role of inflammatory language in forecasting violence against migrant and LGBT communities Humanities and Social Sciences Communications volume\u00a011, Article\u00a0number:\u00a01369 (2024) Cite this article 3636 Accesses 7 Altmetric Metrics details Subjects Abstract Social media messages often provide insights into offline behaviors. Although hate speech proliferates rapidly across social media platforms, it is rarely recognized as a cybercrime, even when it may be linked to offline hate crimes that typically involve physical violence. This paper aims to anticipate violent acts by analyzing online hate speech (hatred, toxicity, and sentiment) and comparing it to offline hate crime. The dataset for this preregistered study included social media posts from X (previously called Twitter) and Facebook and internal police records of hate crimes reported in Spain between 2016 and 2018. After conducting preliminary data analysis to check the moderate temporal correlation, we used time series analysis to develop computational models (VAR, GLMNet, and XGBTree) to predict four time periods of these rare events on a daily and weekly basis. Forty-eight models were run to forecast two types of offline hate crimes, those against migrants and those against the LGBT community. The best model for migrant crime achieved an R2 of 64%, while that for LGBT crime reached 53%. According to the best ML models, the weekly aggregations outperformed the daily aggregations, the national models outperformed those geolocated in Madrid, and those about migration were more effective than those about LGBT people. Moreover, toxic language outperformed hatred and sentim",

Get Involved Report: Online hate increasing against minorities, says expert 23 March 2021 A new report by the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Dr Fernand de Varennes, looks at how to address rising online hate speech against minority groups. Efforts in the fight against \"the tsunami of hate and xenophobia in social media\" appear to be largely failing, because hate is increasing, not diminishing, according to the Special Rapporteur on minority issues, Dr Fernand de Varennes. De Varennes was presenting his report on the outcomes of the 13th Forum on Minority Issues to the latest session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva, Switzerland. In many countries, three quarters or more of the victims of online hate speech are members of minority groups. Women belonging to these groups are disproportionately targeted. \"Too often, hate speech is followed by hate crimes and violence,\" says de Varennes. \"It can too easily prepare the ground for dehumanisation and scapegoating of minorities, and for normalising hate. We need to learn from history and place all our efforts in erasing hate speech from the online space.\" The Forum on Minority Issues, an annual event which last year took place virtually due to the pandemic's restrictions, brought together human rights defenders from minority communities, internet companies and social media platforms, non-governmental organizations, States, academics and UN experts for an open and interactive ",

Hateful speech bears negative repercussions and is particularly damaging in college communities. The efforts to regulate hateful speech on college campuses pose vexing socio-political problems, and the interventions to mitigate the effects require evaluating the pervasiveness of the phenomenon on campuses as well the impacts on students\u2019 psychological state. Data and Methods. Given the growing use of social media among college students, we target the above issues by studying the online aspect of hateful speech in a dataset of 6 million Reddit comments shared in 174 college communities. To quantify the prevelence of hateful speech in an online college community, we devise College Hate Index (CHX). Next, we examine its distribution across the categories of hateful speech, behavior, class, disability, ethnicity, gender, physical appearance, race, rel",

Studies on hate crime in general show that such crimes are associated with a significantly higher feeling of insecurity, but there is little evidence concerning feeling of insecurity due to online hate speech. Based on a secondary data analysis of a representative population survey in Lower Saxony, Germany, on the topic of cybercrime in 2020 (N\u2009=\u20094,102), we tested three hypotheses regarding the effect of offline and online hate speech on feelings of insecurity. As a result, compared to non-victims, victims of online hate speech exhibit a more pronounced feeling of insecurity outside the Internet, while victims of other forms of cybercrime do not differ in this regard from non-victims. We found no effect for offline hate speech when relevant control variables were included in the statistical model. Possible reasons for this finding are assumed to lie in the characteristics of the phenomenon of online hate speech, for example, because the hateful content spreads uncontrollably on the Internet and reaches its victims even in protected private spheres. Introduction While the Internet has become a seemingly indispensable part of our lives, its digital landscape has also given rise to new challenges. With the growing importance of digital communication, online hate speech has increased sharply in recent years (Costello et al., 2017; \u0218tef\u0103ni\u021b\u0103 & Buf, 2021). Hate speech is defined as a verbal attack against a certain group of people with a common characteristic, such as race, gender, ethnic group, religion, or political preference (Casta\u00f1o-Pulgar\u00edn et al., 2021). Due to the perpetrators' (perceived) prejudicial motives, hate speech is a form of \"Group-Related Misant",

It seeps into their daily lives, infecting their psychological and physical well-being and resulting in paranoia, shame, isolation, and even leading to their deaths through honor killing, murder, and suicide. In this post, part of a new series on Cybersecurity and data protection in humanitarian action, Megan O\u2019Brien, from the International Rescue Committee\u2019s Violence Prevention and Response Unit, summarizes her discussions with GBV experts and her review of the existing literature to better understand the impact online violence and technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) has on women and girls in emergency and conflict settings. Patriarchal structures aren\u2019t reserved for physical spaces; they have also shaped the digital world, where online violence and abuse reaches women and girls globally and toxic masculinity norms and practices are amplified. TFGBV is rooted in the same structural gender inequality, cultural and social norms, and patterns of harmful masculinities that cause GBV. TFGBV aims to shame, intimidate, and humiliate women and girls, and it takes shape in an increasing number of ways in humanitarian settings, including, but not limited to, image-based abuse, extortion, and trafficking. Online violence can extend into physical spaces, just as physical violence can extend online.\u00a0TFGBV can be defined as \u201cany act of gender-based violence against women that is committed, assisted or aggravated in part or fully by the use of information communicat",

The digital world offers a useful medium for female empowerment and community building, amplifying the voices of marginalized populations globally. However, social media and online spaces can also be used to exacerbate gender-based online harassment and proliferate structural gender-based violence through disinformation, cyberharassment, cyberstalking, sextortion, recruitment for sex trafficking, revenge porn and threats of physical assault. The perpetrator-victim dynamic changes drastically in an online context, permitting perpetrators to hide behind the anonymity of the internet. Online violence is pervasive and has profound implications for the ability of women, girls and other marginalized individuals to exist safely in digital spaces. Marginalized groups \u2014 including women, gender minoritized groups, LGBTQ+ persons and people with disabilities \u2014 are the most vulnerable to coordinated violence in an online context. Gender-based online abuse is far more prevalent in regions with diminished social and political protections for women and girls. The lessened social status of victims of gender-based online harassment means that there is often little legal or protective recourse for them. According to the United Nations, approximately 40% of all solicitation and recruitment for sex trafficking begins on social media, which markedly increased with the COVID-19 pandemic.

Abstract Offline and online racial discrimination has been associated with mental health problems among adolescents of color. Pandemic shelter-at-home policies and the reignited racial justice movement increased the use of social media among youth of color, potentially exposing them to social media racial discrimination. Yet, it is unclear which aspects of social media significantly contributed to youth exposure to racial discrimination and associated mental health issues during this period. This study assessed the relationships among social media use (hours, racial intergroup contact, and racial justice civic engagement), individual and vicarious social media discrimination (defined as personally directed versus observing discrimination directed at others), and mental health among 115 black, 112 East/Southeast Asian, 79 Indigenous, and 101 Latinx adolescents (N\u2009=\u2009407, 82.31% female, aged 15\u201318 years, M\u2009=\u200916.47, SD\u2009=\u20090.93).

For example, social media connects people through text, pictures, and videos to build a vast social network (De Paor and Heravi, 2020) and significantly influence people's mindset and behaviors (Liu et al., 2018). At the same time, the efficiency of instant information exchange makes social media essential for risk management and responses to hazards, emergencies, and crises (Brengarth and Mujkic, 2016). During the time of crisis, information about the crisis could spread quickly beyond traditional media (e.g., newspapers and television) to social media platforms, including Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, WeChat, and Weibo, at an even more alarming speed (Mart\u00ednez-Rojas et al., 2018). However, convenient information sharing and fast spreading are usually accompanied by misinformation. The lack of online regulation and the anonymity of users also provide a breeding ground for misinformation, disinformation, social bots, fake news, and rumors. The prevalence of misinformation/disinformation has significantly undermined the full benefits of social media use and brought many challenges to cyberspace security and social order. This could create a hostile internet environment where toxic public opinions, fear, anger, and hate spread quickly (Zhang et al., 2022), which would bring significant obstacles for governments in managing emergencies. Therefore, to understand the public responses and attitudinal dynamics and to promote more effective emergency management during emergencies, this Research Topic examines how social media use impacts people's mental health and government responses to c",

While it offers numerous benefits and opportunities for communication and learning, it also presents a darker side that can have a significant impact on our mental health. Negative online content, in various forms, has the power to affect us deeply. In this blog post, we'll explore the ways in which negative online content can impact mental health and discuss strategies for navigating the digital minefield. Cyberbullying and Harassment Cyberbullying and online harassment are all too common in the digital age. The impact on mental health can be profound, leading to psychological distress and isolation. Victims may experience increased stress, anxiety, and depression. Many choose to withdraw from online and offline social interactions, which can intensify feelings of isolation. Hate Speech and Discrimination Exposure to hate speech and discriminatory content can evoke strong negative emotions, including anger, fear, and sadness. It can also lead to lowered self-esteem and a sense of dehumanization for those targeted by such content. Misinformation and Disinformation Misinformation and disinformation are rampant on the internet, and they can have a profound impact on our mental well-being. Exposure to false or misleading information can lead to confusion, anxiety, and a sense of being overwhelmed. It can also influence our beliefs and decision-making processes, contributing to stress and uncertainty. Graphic or Violent Content Graphic or violent content is readily accessible online and can be traumatizing. It may lead to symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in some individuals. Prolonged exposure can desensitize individuals, making them less sensitive to real-world violence. Social Comparison and FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) Social media often pre",

Abstract Cyberbullying has become an international public health concern among adolescents, and as such, it deserves further study. This paper reviews the current literature related to the effects of cyberbullying on adolescent health across multiple studies worldwide and provides directions for future research. A review of the evidence suggests that cyberbullying poses a threat to adolescents\u2019 health and well-being. A plethora of correlational studies have demonstrated a cogent relationship between adolescents\u2019 involvement in cyberbullying and negative health indices. Adolescents who are targeted via cyberbullying report increased depressive affect, anxiety, loneliness, suicidal behavior, and somatic symptoms. Perpetrators of cyberbullying are more likely to report increased substance use, aggression, and delinquent behaviors. Mediating/moderating processes have been found to influence the relationship between cyberbullying and adolescent health. More longitudinal work is needed to increase our understanding of the effects of cyberbullying on adolescent health over time. Prevention and intervention eff",

In those times, online reputation management (ORM) was unheard of, and social media networking was yet to be part of the virtual landscape. The survival rate of being digitally shamed in the early days of the Internet were very slim. \u00a0 I was one of the lucky ones\u00a0 \u00a0 Being able to hire an attorney, sue for Internet defamation and invasion of privacy, in 2006 I won a landmark case in Florida when a jury awarded me $11.3M verdict for the damages that were done to\u00a0my organization\u00a0and myself online. \u00a0 By 2006 when I won my case, I was both financially and emotionally crippled. What should h \u00a0 ave been a celebration was short-lived when I realized that although Lady Justice cleared my name, the Internet never forgives or forgets. \u00a0 Fortunately for me, the first reputation management company opened their doors that summer and I was one of their first clients. I have and continue to say in all my speeches and writings, my attorney vindicated me, however it was ReputationDefender that gave me my life back. \u00a0 The old saying, you don\u2019t get a second chance to make a first impression is no longer related to a handshake or your in-person interview \u2014 it\u2019s your digital resume that people will usually judge you on before ever meeting you in person. \u00a0 CareerBuilders survey\u2019s every year has shown an increase of employers that are discarding potential applicants due to their social media content and behavior.

From hot-button issues sparking cancel culture campaigns to online shaming for perceived missteps, the internet uniquely amplifies emotions. But what lies beneath this surface of digital discontent? This post peels back the layers to explore the psychology of online outrage, offering insights into how it shapes our interactions and impacts our mental health. The Roots of Digital Discontent Understanding Outrage Culture Outrage culture, a term that has gained traction in recent years, refers to the propensity of individuals and groups to react with heightened anger to perceived injustices and slights, often amplified by social media. But why is outrage so prevalent online, and what drives us to engage in or spectate these digital confrontations? Anonymity and the Online Persona One of the key factors fueling social media outrage is the veil of anonymity the internet provides. Anonymity can embolden users, allowing them to express opinions and emotions without the fear of real-world repercussions. As defined by the American Psychological Association, this sense of detachment can lead to deindividuation, a psychological state where individuals lose their sense of self-a",

The current paper explores whether online shaming is motivated by a person's desire to do good (a justice motive); and/or, because it feels good (a hedonic motive), specifically, as a form of pleasure at witnessing another's misfortune (schadenfreude). We examine two key aspects of social media that may moderate these processes: anonymity (Study 1) and social norms (the responses of other users; Studies 2\u20133). Across three experiments (N\u00a0\\=\u00a0225, 198, 202) participants were presented with a fabricated news article featuring an instance of Islamophobia and given the opportunity to respond.

As recruitment continues to be the major cause of trial delays, researchers are turning to online recruitment strategies, e.g. social media, to reach a wider population and reduce recruitment time and costs. There is mixed evidence for the use of online recruitment strategies; therefore, the REcruitment in Mental health trials: broadening the \u2018net\u2019, opportunities for INclusivity through online methoDs (RE-MIND) study aimed to identify evidence and provide guidance for use of online strategies in recruitment to mental health trials, with a focus on whether online strategies can enhance inclusivity. This commentary, as part of the RE-MIND study, focusses on providing recommendations for recruitment strategy selection in future research with the aim to improve trial efficiency. A mixed-methods approach was employed involving three work packages: (I) an evidence review of a cohort of 97 recently published randomised controlled trials/feasibility or pilot studies in mental health to assess the impact of online versus offline recruitment; (II) a qualitative study investigating the experiences of n\u2009=\u200923 key stakeholders on use of an online recruitment approach in mental health clinical trials; (III) combining the results of WP1 and WP2 to produce recommendations on the use of an online recruitment strategy in mental health clinical trials. The findings from WP1 and 2 have been published elsewhere; this commentary represents the results of the third work package.

Online mental health screens reflect one mechanism designed to shorten this lag in help-seeking, yet there has been limited research on the effectiveness of screening tools in naturalistic settings. Material and methods We examined a cohort of persons directed to a mental health screening tool via the Bing search engine (n\u00a0\\=\u00a0126,060). We evaluated the impact of tool content on later searches for mental health self-references, self-diagnosis, care seeking, psychoactive medications, suicidal ideation, and suicidal intent. Website characteristics were evaluated by pairs of independent raters to ascertain screen type and content. These included the presence/absence of a suggestive diagnosis, a message on interpretability, as well as referrals to digital treatments, in-person treatments, and crisis services. Results Using machine learning models, the results suggested that screen content predicted later searches with mental health self-references (AU",

Therefore, this study examined the impact of a web-based personally tailored physical activity intervention on depression, anxiety, stress and quality of life. Methods 501 participants were randomised into either a control group or a pooled intervention condition who received a 3-month web-based personally tailored physical activity intervention. Previously, this intervention has demonstrated to improve self-reported physical activity, but not device-measured physical activity. At baseline, 3- and 9-months, depression, anxiety and stress were assessed using the DASS21, and quality of life was assessed using the SF-12V2. ",

Citations (3)References (68) Abstract Public humiliation is a negative self-conscious emotion that results from experiencing public humiliation; that is, being humiliated in public in front of witnesses. In the current study, experiencing public humiliation refers to the humiliation that is caused by a perpetrator or perpetrators with negative intent at a location that is accessible or visible to the public and in the presence of a witness(es). To investigate the settings where public humiliation occurs, its prevalence, and its impact on victims\u2019 mental health, a systematic review and meta-analysis approach were employed. A total of 33 studies with a sample size of 40,468 were included in the current study. The findings demonstrate the behaviour of public humiliation occurred in a variety of settings (e.g., medical training, healthcare provision, schools) and population groups. The pooled prevalence of experiencing public humiliation was 34.9% (95%CI [0.266, 0.442]). The pooled effect size of experiencing public humiliation on victims\u2019 mental health outcomes was OR = 1.878, 95%CI [1.550, 2.276]",

The moral rights of the named author(s) have been asserted. Abstract The author identifies acts of humiliation as a specific and often traumatic way of exercising power, with a set of consistently occurring elements and predictable consequences, including a loss of the ability to trust others. It is argued that these consequences are serious and long-lasting. The article makes a distinction between \u2018shame\u2019 as a state of mind and \u2018humiliation\u2019 as an act perpetrated against a person or group. The interplay between humiliation and shame after a humiliating act is discussed. It is argued that the patient's recovery of the capacity to resume a relatively normal life is made more likely if the therapist acknowledges the specificity of humiliation, the impossibility of reversing a humiliating act and the importance of focussing on the consequences of humiliation.

Cyberbullying is a very serious issue affecting not just the young victims, but also the victims' families, the bully, and those who witness instances of cyberbullying. However, the effect of cyberbullying can be most detrimental to the victim, of course, as they may experience a number of emotional issues that affect their social and academic performance as well as their overall mental health. As parents today, you may not have ever experienced cyberbullying yourself. It may be hard to fathom how some words of text on a computer screen can lead to such trauma. After all, bullying has seemingly always been a facet of school and on the playground. Perhaps you have seen or experienced bullying when you were in school. Maybe you feel that bullying is just a normal part of school life. You might also think that face-to-face bullying is much worse than cyberbullying since the victims of real-world bullying have more difficulty escaping their tormentors, while a victim of cyberbullying can simply turn off the computer or block a bully on a social media platform. Unfortunately, it's not that simple. And while the effects of real-world bullying behavior are not to be dismissed, the effects of cyberbullying can actually be much worse. As parents, it is up to you to understand the true impact of cyberbullying, to recognize a change in your child\u2019s behavior as a result of cyberbullying, and to find a way to help your child in a supportive manner.How can cyberbullying be worse than real-world bullying? In a real-world bullying situation, most incidents of bullying occur between the victim and a bully (or group of bullies) in school. These incidents can range from simple name-calling to more significant acts of bullying, such as rumor-spreading, harassment, threats, and incidents of physical harm. However, whereas victims of real-world bullying can be granted a reprieve when they go home, there simply is no escape from cyberbullying. Cyberbullying doesn\u2019t end when the school bell rings.

In particular, little is known about young people\u2019s perceptions of the association between cyberbullying and suicidal behaviours.

The incidences of both cyberbullying and adolescent suicide are rising in the United States, with recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data showing that 14.9 percent of adolescents have been cyberbullied and 13.6 percent of adolescents have made a serious suicide attempt. Cyberbullying has been associated with suicide of a victim in several recent cases, a phenomenon that has been newly termed cyberbullicide. Parents and youth are frequently unaware of the risks and potential criminal liability associated with cyberbullying. Legislation that protects against online bullying has developed from antibullying laws, and as an expansion of the requirement that schools prohibit any bullying at school or via technology that interferes with learning. Cyberbullying laws exist in certain states, but as there are no federal laws that address bullying or cyberbullying, cyberbullying is prosecuted federally via statutes governing cyberstalking. After examining the epidemiology of adolescent suicidality, cyberbullying, and cyberbullicide, this article reviews recent legislation governing cyberbullying. Finally, this article illustrates the role of the forensic psychiatrist in civil and criminal cases involving suspected cyberbullicide. Today\u2019s youth are exposed to the Internet through the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, social networking, and messaging, carrying a simultaneous devaluation of face-to-face and telephone communication. This rapid expansion of online socialization has introduced new complications to old problems, including the progression of bullying into cyberbullying and cyberbullicide. Cyberbullicide is a new term for a subclass of suicides that was coined by prominent cyberbullying researchers Sameer Hinduja and Justin Patchin in the 2000s. The term desc",

To address this issue and improve users' mental well-being, social media use interventions (eg, abstinence from social media) have been developed and evaluated. However, there is limited understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions in improving mental well-being. Objective: This systematic review aimed to synthesize the literature on the effectiveness of social media use interventions in improving mental well-being in adults. Methods: A systematic search (January 1, 2004, to July 31, 2022) was completed across 3 databases in accordance with the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Experimental studies evaluating the impact of social media use interventions on mental well-being in adults were included. Outcomes related to mental well-being, such as depression, anxiety, stress, and loneliness, were included.

Abstract Social media use by minors has significantly increased and has been linked to depression and suicidality. Simultaneously, age-adjusted suicide rates have steadily increased over the past decade in the United States with suicide being the second most common cause of death in youth. Hence, the increase in suicide rate parallels the simultaneous increase in social media use. In addition, the rate of nonsuicidal self-injury ranges between 14% and 21% among young people. Evidence suggests that self-harming youth is more active on online social networks than youth who do not engage in self-harm behavior. The role of online social networking on deliberates self-harm and suicidality in adolescents with a focus on negative influence was assessed by conducting a systematized literature review. A literature search on \u201cPubMed\u201d and \u201cOvid Medline\u201d using a combination of MeSH terms yielded nine articles for data extr",

Design Systematic review and meta-analysis. Data sources PubMed/Medline, PsychInfo, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, and Google Scholar, searched up to September 2019. Review methods Studies were included if they compared at least one time point before and one time point after media reports on suicide; follow-up was two months or less; the outcome was death by suicide; and the media reports were about non-fictional suicides. Data from studies adopting an interrupted time series design, or single or multiple arm before and after comparisons, were reviewed. Results 31 studies were identified and analysed, and 20 studies at moderate risk of bias were included in the main analyses. The risk of suicide increased by 13% in the period after the media reported a death of a celebrity by suicide (rate ratio 1.13, 95% confidence interval 1.08 to 1.18; 14 studies; median follow-up 28 days, range 7-60 days). When the suicide method used by the celebrity was reported, there was an associated 30% increase in deaths by the same method (rate ratio 1.30, 95% confidence interval 1.18 to 1.44; 11 studies; median follow-up 28 days, range 14-60 days). For general reporting of suicide, the rate ratio was 1.002 (0.997 to 1.008; five studies; median follow-up 1 day, range 1-8 days) for a one article increase in the number of reports on suicide. Heterogeneity was large and partially explained by celebrity and methodological factors. Enhanced funnel plots suggested some publication bias in the literature. Conclu",

Abstract Background Young people are particularly vulnerable to experiencing mental health difficulties, but very few seek treatment or help during this time. Online help-seeking may offer an additional domain where young people can seek aid for mental health difficulties, yet our current understanding of how young people seek help online is limited. Objective This was an exploratory study which aimed to investigate the online help-seeking behaviors and preferences of young people. Methods This study made use of an anonymous online survey. Young people aged 18-25, living in Ireland, were recruited through social media ads on Twitter and Facebook and participated in the survey. Results A total of 1308 respondents completed the survey. Many of the respondents (80.66%;",

The company collected sensitive health information from users and sold it to advertisers for ad targeting purposes.

The principal federal laws in this area prohibit: Below, we summarize: Jump Links: How to Report Key Federal Laws Copyright Law How to Report Online Abuse at the Federal Level Deciding whether to report online abuse to the federal government and/or to local law enforcement can be confusing and intimidating. If you feel that online abuse has put you or your family in immediate danger, contact local law enforcement. If the online abuse you are experiencing involves an intimate partner based locally and/or involves people you know to be local, it may be more effective to start by reporting to local law enforcement. Furthermore, contacting local law enforcement to file a report of the online abuse you\u2019re experiencing creates a paper trail that can also be very useful should you decide to report online abuse at the federal level. The local police precinct will take a report of your complaint and can refer you to the appropriate federal agency. You can learn more about involving local law enforcement when facing online abuse in this Field Manual. Some severely abusive tactics (such as stalking, hacking, and threats) may be considered a federal crime. If you are experiencing severe online abuse, you may decide to report these incidents to local law enforcement and to the federal government. Here is a rundown of different categories of cyber crime and which federal agency to contact. You can report these crimes to your local FBI field office and/or the FBI\u2019s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). The IC3 can review a complaint and refer it to the appropriate law enforcement agency. However, one of the main purposes for the IC3 is for federal law enforcers to monitor t",

Email: hygiea.casiano@umanitoba.ca Issue date 2020 Jul. Abstract Objective: Understand the relationship between criminal accusations, victimization, and mental disorders at a population level using administrative data from Manitoba, Canada. Method: Residents aged 18 to 64 between April 1, 2007, and March 31, 2012 (N = 793,024) with hospital- and physician-diagnosed mental disorders were compared to those without. Overall and per-person rates of criminal accusations and reported victimization in the 2011/2012 fiscal year were examined. Relative risks were calculated, adjusting for age, sex, income, and presence of a substance use disorder. The overlap between diagnosed mental disorders, accusations, and victimization with a \u03c72 test of independence was studied. Results: Twenty-four percent (n = 188,693) of the population had a mental disorder over the 5-year time frame. Four to fifteen percent of those with a mental disorder had a criminal accusation, compared to 2.4% of the referent group.

Social media\u2019s impact on our mental health and tips to use it safely For many of us, checking Instagram, Facebook, TikTok and other social media is a part of our normal routine. In 2023, there was an estimated 4.9 billion social media users worldwide. The average person spends 145 minutes on social media every day. Viewing posts from friends and family across the world can be a way to make you feel more connected. However, social media use has a dark side. Social media can negatively impact our overall wellbeing by fueling anxiety, depression, loneliness and FOMO (fear or missing out). These issues are especially prevalent in teens and young adults. Social media is here to stay and will continue to evolve and become more invasive. If you\u2019re spending a lot of time on social media and feeling sadness, dissatisfaction, frustration, or loneliness, it may be time to re-examine your relationship with your online presence. Understanding how social media impacts our mental health and overall wellbeing is important for yourself and your loved ones. Mental health impacts Social media use may increase feelings of anxiety and depression, specifically in teens and young adults. The addictive nature of social media activates the brain\u2019s reward center by releasing dopamine. This is a \u201cfeel-good chemical\u201d linked to pleasurable activities. When we post something, our friends and family can \u201clike\u201d it, giving us a boost of dopamine. However, when we don\u2019t get that boost or approval, it can impact our sense of self and adequacy. Filters: Social media heavily focuses on physical appearance. Many social media platforms \u2013 such as Snapchat, Instagram, and TikTok \u2013 provide users with the option to use filters on an image. Filters can be great for a laugh, but the ability to easily alter physical appearance and hide imperfections can create false illusions. Constant exposure to altered images can also lead you to feel self-conscious and dislike the way you look. FOMO",

Chan School of Public Health, discusses a new study he co-authored on associations between social media use and mental health and well-being. What is healthy vs. potentially problematic social media use? Our study has brought preliminary evidence to answer this question. Using a nationally representative sample, we assessed the association of two dimensions of social media use\u2014how much it\u2019s routinely used and how emotionally connected users are to the platforms\u2014with three health-related outcomes: social well-being, positive mental health, and self-rated health. We found that routine social media use\u2014for example, using social media as part of everyday routine and responding to content that others share\u2014is positively associated with all three health outcomes. Emotional connection to social media\u2014for example, checking apps excessively out of fear of missing out, being disappointed about or feeling disconnected from friends when not logged into social media\u2014is negatively associated with all three outcomes. In more general terms, these findings suggest that as long as we are mindful users, routine use may not in itself be a problem. Indeed, it could be beneficial. For those with unhealthy social media use, behavioral interventions may help. For example, programs that develop \u201ceffortful control\u201d skills\u2014the ability to self-regulate behavior\u2014have been widely shown to be useful in dealing with problematic Internet and social media use. We\u2019re used to hearing that social media use is harmful to mental health and well-being, particularly for young people. Did it surprise you to find that it can have positive effects? The findings go against what some might expect, which is intriguing. We know that having a strong social network is associated with positive mental health and well-being. Routine social media use may compens",

According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), nearly one in five U.S. adults is living with a mental illness, and the prevalence of mental health problems among youth is even more alarming (NIMH, 2023). The widespread use of social networking sites has been identified as a contributing factor to the growing mental health crisis, especially among younger generations. The Link Between Social Media and Mental Health Issues The link between social media and mental health issues has been well documented in numerous studies and research papers. A systematic review found that the use of social networking sites is associated with an increased risk of depression, anxiety, and psychological distress (Keles, et al., 2020). The associations, though not by itself proof of causation, at least some reason for concern. Additionally, this association is particularly strong in adolescents compared to younger children (Twenge & Campbell, 2018). Moreover, in the United States, the 12-month prevalence of major depressive episodes among adolescents increased from 8.7% in 2005 to 11.3% in 2014 (Mojtabai, et al., 2016). The new media screen activities have been suggested as one of the causes of the increase in adolescent depression and suicide (Twenge, et al., 2017). Although research has not necessarily shown that the use of social media has a causal relationship with poorer mental health in young people, health professionals and policy ma",

It can enhance connection, increase self-esteem, and improve a sense of belonging. But it can also lead to tremendous stress, pressure to compare oneself to others, and increased sadness and isolation. Mindful use is essential to social media consumption. Social media has become integral to our daily routines: we interact with family members and friends, accept invitations to public events, and join online communities to meet people who share similar preferences using these platforms. Social media has opened a new avenue for social experiences since the early 2000s, extending the possibilities for communication. According to recent research [1], people spend 2.3\u00a0h daily on social media. YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Snapchat have become increasingly popular among youth in 2022, and one-third think they spend too much time on these platforms [2]. The considerable time people spend on social media worldwide has directed researchers\u2019 attention toward the potential benefits and risks. Research shows excessive use is mainly associated with lower psychological well-being [3]. However, findings also suggest that the quality rather than the quantity of social media use can determine whether the experience will enhance or deteriorate the user\u2019s mental health [4]. In this collection, we will explore the impact of social media use on mental health by providing comprehensive research perspectives on positive and negative effects. Social media can provide opportunities to enhance the mental health of users by facilitating social connections and peer support [5]. Indeed, online communities can provide a space for discussions regarding health conditions, adverse life events, or everyday challenges, which may decrease the sense of stigmatization and increase belonging",

The popularization and application of the Internet has brought great convenience to the people, promoted the communication and interaction between the government and the people, and added new ways of expressing public opinion; the Internet is highly developed, and the government makes full use of its role to collect social opinions through Internet. Public opinion promotes the democratization and scientific rationality of public policies. This article will discuss the following aspects: first, focus on the influence of online public opinion on public policy, explain the research background of the article, analyze and organize it; second, consult relevant literature, sort out the related concepts of online public opinion and public policy and characteristics; third, analyze the value of online public opinion on public policies, including positive and negative effects, based on cases, data, and referenced literature; finally, put forward targeted suggestions and countermeasures for existing problems, including improvement. The government plays an important role in the construction of network infrastructure and strengthening the moral education of netizens. It is necessary to do a good job in guiding the network public opinion, devote itself to creating a good and healthy network atmosphere, and attach importance to the dual influence of network public opinion on public policies, to make it fully play its positive role.

This paper mainly studies the positive and negative impacts of public opinion on digital media. Conduct research through methods such as literature analysis, case analysis, and review. This paper finds that individuals have greater opportunities to offer their opinions on digital media. In this way, digital media enhances freedom of expression, and public opinion expressed through digital media serves to safeguard and uphold public rights as well. However, polarized public opinion in digital media can also have adverse effects, such as peer pressure and cyber bullying. Therefore, governments, schools and individuals should take their respective responsibilities to maintain the positive effects of digital media on public opinion, solve problems with public opinion in the digital media and better utilize the benefits of digital media and public opinion.

Social media usage in public opinion has many objectives that differ from one case to another, as we will explain in more detail in this article. However, they can be summed up in two general objectives: 1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Changing an unwanted situation by creating a collective mindset through which the public can unite to take a stand on social or political issues and create social movements. 2. \u00a0 \u00a0 Creating a positive mental image for the brand or company in the public\u2019s mind. Introduction on how social media influences public opinion After the technological revolution dominated the world and changed our lifestyle and way of exchanging knowledge, social media became the most significant influence on public opinion. A person\u2019s awareness, personality, and thinking pattern are shaped by what they acquire from the behaviors and information present in their surrounding environment. That environment includes; family, friends, school, places of worship, religious practices, and any other place or means they can interact with others and learn from. That can happen through face-to-face communication or any cultural or artistic forms such as; books, music, or movies. With the advent of the internet and social media, they have become a major component of the environment that constitutes and affects human awareness, inclinations, opinions, and even behaviors. It has also become the easiest way to communicate with different people from all over the world, access information from various sources in the easiest and fastest way, and learn the diverse ideologies of different cultures. That is how social media influences public opinion and moves the audience towards the desired behavior. What impact does social media hav",

Thus, a more practical approach is urgently needed to deal with this dynamic and complicated phenomenon of propagating public opinion. This paper proposes that the outbreak of internet public opinion and its negative impacts, such as the occurrence of major security incidents, are a result of coupling and the complex interaction of many factors. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method model is composed of those factors and considers the stages of network information dissemination, the unique propagation rule, and textual sentiment resonance on the internet. Moreover, it is the first public opinion governance method that simultaneously highlights the complex system, functional identification, and functional resonance. It suggests a more effective method to shorten the dissipation time of negative public opinion and is a considerable improvement over previous models for risk-prediction. Based on resonance theory and deep learning, this study establishes public opinion resonance functions, which made it possible to analyze public opinion triggers and build a simulation",

Views of social media and its impacts on society When asked whether social media is a good or bad thing for democracy in their country, a median of 57% across 19 countries say that it is a good thing. In almost every country, close to half or more say this, with the sentiment most common in Singapore, where roughly three-quarters believe social media is a good thing for democracy in their country. However, in the Netherlands and France, about four-in-ten agree. And in the U.S., only around a third think social media is positive for democracy \u2013 the smallest share among all 19 countries surveyed. In eight countries, those who believe that the political system in their country allows them to have an influence on politics are also more likely to say that social media is a good thing for democracy. This gap is most evident in Belgium, where 62% of those who feel their political system allows them to have a say in politics also say that social media is a good thing for democracy in their country, compared with 44% among those who say that their political system does not allow them much influence on politics. Those who view the spread of false information online as a major threat to their country are less likely to say that social media is a good thing for democracy, compared with those who view the spread of misinformation online as either a minor threat or not a threat at all. This is most clearly observed in the Netherlands, where only four-in-ten (39%) among those who see the spread of false information online as a major threat say that social media has been a good thing for democracy in their country, as opposed to the nearly six-in-ten (57%) among those who do not consider the spread of misinformation online to be a threat who say the same.

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes.

Just kidding. I\u2019m white!\u201d By the time she landed, eleven hours later, her ill-advised missive had gone disastrously viral. She stumbled off the plane to discover that a multitude of online detractors had weighed in on her character. Now she was a globally known racist. The woman, Justine Sacco, was one of the first high-profile casualties of public shaming in the digital era, and she suffered all the consequences that have since become routine: job loss, wide-scale condemnation, and a public identity subsumed by a very public sin. Still, in the wake of subsequent disasters, her story is almost quaint. How pleasant it is to recall a simpler, kinder time when an online mobbing was an occurrence so unusual that it merited two articles in the Times. Our social fabric has since frayed considerably. What\u2019s curious about the brutality that fuels Internet shaming frenzies is that in real life\u2014that is, IRL, in the usual online parlance\u2014most of us would hesitate to consign a normal nobody to nationwide notoriety and several years of unemployment. We might even have mustered the charity to read Sacco\u2019s quip as a satirical, if clumsy, sendup of the white privilege and parochialism that give rise to public-health inequalities. (Sacco, as people in her inner circle would have known, was no stranger to either Africa or progressive causes.) Yet the nasty comments went on accumulating, as if of their own accord. \u201cWe are about to watch this @JustineSacco bitch get fired. In REAL time.

Abstract Purpose Online social networking sites (SNSs) have become a popular mode of communication between adolescents. However, little is known about the effects of social online activity on health behaviors. The authors examine the use of SNSs between friends and the degree to which SNS activities relate to face-to-face peer influences and adolescent risk behaviors. Methods Longitudinal egocentric friendship network data along with adolescent social media use and risk behaviors were collected from 1,563 tenth grade students across five Southern California high schools. Measures of online and offline peer influences were computed and assessed using fixed effects models. Results The frequency of adolescent SNS use and the number of their closest friends on the same SNS were not significantly associated with risk behaviors. However, exposure to friends\u2019 online pictures of partying or drinking was significantly associated with both smoking (\u03b2=.07, p<.001) and alcohol use (\u03b2=.08, p<.05).

A new study by researchers at the University of Glasgow, however, found young children and teens who use social media struggle more with things like substance abuse and depression. Indeed, the study looked at data from 1.4 million children and teens \u2013 between the ages of 10 and 19 \u2013 from 1997 to 2022 and found those who spent 2 hours or more on social media per day were two times more likely to drink alcohol. It also found adolescents using social media on a daily or frequent basis were more likely to gamble and engage in unsafe sexual activity. Additionally, the probability of underaged smoking increased by 85% and drug use increased by 28%. Social media makes these behaviors worse for a few reasons, like increased peer pressure, isolation and influence from posts/ads. Gambling, specifically, is a newer issue since the Supreme Court cleared the legal pathway for online betting in 2018. A recent survey from New Jersey\u2019s Council on Compulsive Gambling found almost 70% of 16- to 25-year-olds in the state saw at least 4 gambling ads on social media each week. Similarly, a study from the NCAA found that 58% of students surveyed said they were more likely to bet after seeing gambling ads. The average American spends 2 hours using social media each day, but a study from Gallup found that 51% of adolescents (13 to 19 years old) spend an average of 4.8 hours a day on social media. A Piper Sandler survey found that number to be 4.5 hours. Gallup also found that 76.7% of teens spend at least 2 hours on social media each day, but less than one-third spend that much time doing homework. The list of social media\u2019s negative impacts is long: mental health issues, increased risk of negative peer influence and even changes in structural bra",

It\u2019s particularly challenging during the pre-teen and teen years, and research shows that peer pressure is one of the main reasons adolescents engage in risky and unhealthy behaviors.\u00a0 In today\u2019s world filled with digital devices, internet connectivity, apps, and social media platforms, peer pressure has taken on new and more pervasive forms that extend beyond the time children and teens are together in person.

In the last decade, professors have increasingly emphasized the threat posed by self-censorship to students\u2019 ability to engage in open inquiry, appreciate viewpoint diversity, and even discuss uncomfortable scientific conclusions. Among professors, self-censorship has affected the ability to pursue controversial research, give lectures, and operate in a cordial faculty environment. Pressure from foreign countries has also led administrators and professors to self-censor. While some commentators have questioned whether campuses have a self-censorship problem, evidence continues to point toward a growing reluctance, particularly among students, to express themselves openly. On campus, within the larger academic community, and across the nation, self-censorship is growing. The centrality of universities and colleges to democracy, intellectual ex",

About one-quarter of the local and national journalists say they have purposely avoided newsworthy stories, while nearly as many acknowledge they have softened the tone of stories to benefit the interests of their news organizations. Fully four-in-ten (41%) admit they have engaged in either or both of these practices. The poll of 206 reporters and 81 news executives \u2014 150 from local news outlets and 137 from national news organizations \u2014 found widespread concern over commercial and competitive pressures. As a result of these pressures, say journalists, good stories all too frequently are not pursued. There is general agreement about the extent of the self-censorship and its principal causes. Market pressures \u2014 manifested when newsworthy stories are avoided because they are too boring or complicated \u2014 are seen as the most common factor. Majorities in the print and broadcast media acknowledge that newsworthy stories are often or sometimes avoided because of their complexity or lack of audience appeal. Nearly eight-in-ten (77%) say stories that are seen as important but dull are often (27%) or sometimes avoided (50%). A majority (52%) also says that overly complex stories are at least sometimes ignored. Fewer but still significant percentages report that such stories are not pursued because they conflict with organizational interests. More than one-third (35%) say news that would hurt the financial interests of a news organization often or sometimes goes unreported, while slightly fewer (29%) say the same about stories that could adve",

Understanding what motivates users to join these communities, and how they affect them and others, spans various psychological domains, including organizational psychology, political and social psychology, and clinical and health psychology. We focus on online communities that are exemplary for three domains: work, hate, and addictions. We review the risks that emerge from these online communities but also recognize the opportunities that work and behavioral addiction communities present for groups and individuals. With the continued evolution of online spheres, online communities are likely to have an increasingly significant role in all spheres of life, ranging from personal to professional and from individual to societal. Psychological research provides critical insights into understanding the formation of online\u00c2\u00a0communities, and the implications for individuals and society. To counteract risks, it needs to identify opportunities for prevention and support.

Based on the complex network theory, the dynamic model of network public opinion dissemination is constructed, applied social network method to analyze the influence mechanism of information interaction of network public opinion participants on network public opinion communication, using the method of simulation, this paper discussed the influence of external factors on the communication state and risk of public opinion under the conditions of single interference, information superposition and time series transformation. The results show the advantage of government information release before large-scale dissemination is that can reduce the spread risk of public opinion. The media information release later than the government has a positive effect on the risk prevention and control of public opinion propagation. Under the interaction of media and government information, the information superposition effect is more significant, and superposition effect appearance is related to the order of the participants information release and the reliability of the facts represented by participants.

Views of social media and its impacts on society When asked whether social media is a good or bad thing for democracy in their country, a median of 57% across 19 countries say that it is a good thing. In almost every country, close to half or more say this, with the sentiment most common in Singapore, where roughly three-quarters believe social media is a good thing for democracy in their country. However, in the Netherlands and France, about four-in-ten agree. And in the U.S., only around a third think social media is positive for democracy \u2013 the smallest share among all 19 countries surveyed. In eight countries, those who believe that the political system in their country allows them to have an influence on politics are also more likely to say that social media is a good thing for democracy. This gap is most evident in Belgium, where 62% of those who feel their political system allows them to have a say in politics also say that social media is a good thing for democracy in their country, compared with 44% among those who say that their political system does not allow them much influence on politics. Those who view the spread of false information online as a major threat to their country are less likely to say that social media is a good thing for democracy, compared with those who view the spread of misinformation online as either a minor threat or not a threat at all. This is most clearly observed in the Netherlands, where only four-in-ten (39%) among those who see the spread of false information online as a major threat say that social media has been a good thing for democracy in their country, as opposed to the nearly six-in-ten (57%) among those who do not consider the spread of misinformation online to be a threat who say the same.

Abstract Public health emergencies can quickly provoke alarm and shock in the society, as well as generate high-impact online public opinion through network fermentation. Analyzing the generation mechanism of online public opinion in public health emergencies helps to explain its characteristics and laws. Based on information ecology theory, seven indicators from the four dimensions of information person, information, information technology, and information environment are extracted, and the analysis framework of public opinion impact of public health emergencies is constructed. Taking 40 cases from China as samples, fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) is used to investigate the generation ",

As I detailed in a previous essay, we do not make decisions based on a computer-like cost-benefit analysis. Rather, we are primarily governed by the hot-blooded responses of the limbic system, with rational calculation \u2014 to the extent that we have mastered it at all \u2014 mainly stepping in when emotion fails to provide guidance. These emotional systems are a blunt instrument. They operate impressionistically and instinctually, guiding our actions towards those that evolution, in its not-so-infinite wisdom, has deemed optimal for our survival. There is little room for nuance or fine distinctions when it comes to surviving in the jungle. Given the vital significance of social standing and acceptance in our evolutionary past, it\u2019s also not surprising that social cues play an enormously important role in guiding these gut-level judgements, even while we may think we are forming our own independent views. We learned very early in our social evolutionary history the art of identifying social trends, adopting and expressing conforming beliefs, \u201cothering\u201d outsiders in order to strengthen group identity, and so on. These dynamics have only been amplified in the social media age.

Brad Bergan Zac Harris / Unsplash Recently, the Indian National Congress announced its intentions to recruit an army of more than 500,000 \u201csocial media warriors\u201d to face down the Bharatiya Janata Party in the online space, according to a Yahoo!News report. This is the latest in an increasingly frequent trend of social media collectives rising to create a real-world impact in the lives of the general public. Typically, we associate the idea of \u201cinternet mobs\u201d with negativity, like the incident on Capitol Hill in early January. However, other examples, like \u201cThe Arab Spring\u201d \u2014 when much of the Arab world used social media to organize protests and other actions against local governments \u2014 are harder to place clearly. For better and worse, when people organize for action using social media, it has the power to reshape the fabric of society. Internet mobs are reshaping the fabric of reality The ostensible target for India\u2019s army of social media warriors will be the BJP\u2019s \u201cIT cell,\u201d and India\u2019s Congress will soon announce a helpline number for people who would like to join its IT cell. You don\u2019t have to takes sides in an intra-Indian online dispute to understand that hiring social media warriors to fight on the virtual frontlines will likely intensify the situation. But it\u2019s a difficult problem to answer, since social media has become a primary influence on public opinion.

There is no question that physical mobs still exist today \u2014 but do mobs also exist online? Shaming, name-calling, accusations and threats are daily occurrences on the Internet, and one nasty comment can quickly enflame hundreds, even thousands, of others to join in. The Elaborated Social Identity Model is a current dominant theory of crowd psychology. It suggests that individuals do not lose their personal identity when placed in a group or mob setting, but act collectively with the crowd on the basis of a shared social identity. As a result, individuals in a large crowd experience a heightened sense of psychological empowerment, there are feelings of support by those involved, and a sense of shared identity towards a common issue or goal. Stephen Riecher, one of the psychologists who developed the theory, states in his paper The Psychology of Crowd Dynamics that, \u201ccrowd action is patterned in such a way as to reflect existing cultures and societies.\u201d He continues that an individual can belong to many different social identities or groups, and that their behaviour can change depending on which social identity is more relevant at the time. Following the results of game seven in the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals in Vancouver between the Canucks and rivalling Boston Bruins, riots broke out in the core of city. Police cars were flipped and burned in the streets, shop windows were broken and squads of armed police officers were sent in to control the horde, which involved over 300 participants. The Night the City became a Stadium, a report conducted after the riot found that a misconceived notion of mob mentality by enforcers when paired with the size of the crowd largely contributed to heightening the destruction caused by the",

The term encompasses vigilantism against alleged scams, crimes, and non-Internet-related behavior. The expanding scope of media savvy and online interaction has enabled vigilantes to utilize methods specific to the Internet in order to distribute justice to parties they consider to be corrupt, but who have not committed a formal crime or have not been held accountable by the criminal justice system.[1] Internet vigilantism originated in the early 2000s and has since evolved to include a variety of methods such as hacking, baiting, and public shaming. Internet vigilantism changes in cultural and political drive depending on location, and has varying relationships to state authority depending on context. There are many internet vigilante groups as well as individuals. Description The term internet vigilantism describes punitive public denunciations, aimed at swaying public opinion in order to \u201ctake justice into one's own hands\u201d by engaging in forms of targeted surveillance, unwanted attention, negative publicity, repression, coercion or dissuasion. Associate professor in sociology Benjamin Loveluck identifies the four main forms of internet vigilantism as: flagging, investigation, hounding, and organized denunciation. Also referred to by Steve Man as Sousveillance, meaning \"to watch from below\", internet vigilantism can work as a type of peer surveillance. This is based on the premise that shame can be used as a form of social control.[2] August\u0117 Dementavi\u010dien\u0117 defines the phenomena through the concept of Swarms, which are \"Short term relationships between consumers formed for the purpose of achieving a goal\".[3] There are muddied overlaps between internet vigilantism and cyberbullying, as both utilize public shaming methods, and cyberbullying may sometimes be conducted under the guise of internet vigilantism. This is in the case that the vigilante \"realizes they aren't achieving social justice b",

These groups have claimed some significant victories in their battles against ISIS and similar organizations, by hacking their email, publicly exposing their secret communications, and knocking their websites offline. The hacker groups also combat other cyber criminals, including distributors of child pornography. Some of the groups' activities, however, violate the computer hacking laws of many nations. Some commentators have criticized these statutes, claiming that the laws unnecessarily prohibit private actors from serving the public good. In this Essay, I defend the broad prohibition of cyber-vigilantism, and argue that well-intentioned private actors can accomplish their goals by working with governments. I first review global jurisprudence, case studies, and academic commentary to explain why courts and policymakers historically have disfavoured vigilantism in other contexts, and I apply that reasoning to cyberspace. I explain that cyber-vigilantism can lead to several negative consequences, including the potential for abuse of the system, undercutting the legitimacy of democratic systems, and disproportionate punishments that are not necessarily effective. I then argue that instead of operating independently, these private groups can more effectively collaborate with governments and other private actors to f",

These modern-day guardians of the digital realm are neither caped crusaders nor masked avengers, but they do wield a power that challenges traditional notions of justice. Welcome to the world of cyber vigilantism, where the line between hero and villain blurs in the name of online righteousness. At the forefront of studying this phenomenon is Dr. Leanna Ireland, PhD, assistant professor of criminal justice in the Department of Economics, Justice and Policy Studies at Mount Royal University. With a keen interest in vigilantism in the online world, Ireland is shedding light on new forms of activism, social movements and justice-seeking behaviour. The rise of cyber vigilantism Vigilantism \u2014 where people take justice into their own hands \u2014 has a long history, dating back to ancient times. The internet has moved the practice forward by allowing millions of people to engage in a single act of vigilantism all at once. Despite new technology, motives such as frustration over the inaction of authorities have remained largely unchanged over time. Today, some self-appointed crimefighters target serious criminal offences such as child exploitation. For example, one of the top results for \u201cped(ophile) hunter\u201d on TikTok is an account with more than 183,000 followers. Others take on socially deviant cases. An early example comes from 2005 in which a young woman refused to clean up after her dog did its business in a subway car in South Korea. A fellow commuter posted pictures on social media and the incident turned into a viral sensation, sparking outrage online. \u201cUndoubtedly, acts of cyber vigilantism are becoming more commonplace with the proliferation of digital tools,\u201d Ireland says. \u201cMore people \u2014 regardless of their technical skills \u2014 can now engage in cyber vigilantism efforts. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take much to create an X or TikTok account and shame someone for their actions and, or, release their pe",

At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles \u2013 either online, in the real world, or both. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Societal Implications of Cancel Culture The Rise of Cancel Culture: Social, Cultural, and Technological Factors Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there\u2019s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals\u2019 actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These plat",

Some critics argue that cancel culture has a chilling effect on public discourse, that it is unproductive, that it does not bring real social change, that it causes intolerance, or that it amounts to cyberbullying.[8][9] Others argue that the term is used to attack efforts to promote accountability or give disenfranchised people a voice, and to attack language that is itself free speech. Still others question whether cancel culture is an actual phenomenon,[10] arguing that boycotting has existed long before the origin of the term \"cancel culture\".[9][11][12] While the careers of some public figures have been impacted by boycotts\u2014widely described as \"cancellation\"\u2014others who complained of cancellation successfully continued their careers.[13][14] Origins The 1981 Chic album Take It Off includes the song \"Your Love Is Cancelled\", which compares a breakup to the cancellation of TV shows. The song was written by Nile Rodgers following a bad date Rodgers had with a woman who expected him to misuse his celebrity status on her behalf. \"Your Love Is Cancelled\" inspired screenwriter Barry Michael Cooper to include a reference to a woman being canceled in the 1991 film New Jack City.[15] This usage introduced the term to African-American Vernacular English, where it became more common.[16] By 2015, the concept of canceling had become widespread on Black Twitter to refer to a ",

With the rapid development of information and communication technology, social media platforms have changed the way people interact, share information, and express their views. The purpose of this study is to analyse the role of social media in shaping public opinion and its influence on economic decisions. This research uses a qualitative method. Data collection involved literature review and social media content analysis, focusing on opinion patterns and their influence. Reliability and validity were emphasised through triangulation and participation of secondary source participants in the analysis process. The study results show that in a digital age characterised by the central role of social media, it can be concluded that social media has a significant role in shaping public opinion and also influencing economic decision-making. Through social media, individuals and groups can interact with each other, share information, and participate in discussions that shape collective views on various issues.

As digital media becomes increasingly prevalent, understanding its impact on public discourse is essential. The research highlights the unique attributes of social media, including interactivity, immediacy, and user-generated content, which differentiate it from traditional media formats such as television, radio, and print. By synthesizing findings from a variety of scholarly articles, this study identifies key themes regarding how social media influences public perception, mobilizes communities, and facilitates the spread of information. Furthermore, the analysis reveals significant challenges, including the prevalence of misinformation and echo chambers, which can distort public opinion and polarize discourse. The results indicate that while social media offers opportunities for broader engagement and diverse perspectives, it also necessitates critical literacy among users to navigate the complexities of digital information landscapes. This paper contributes to the ongoing discourse on media studies by providing a comprehensive overview of the comparative effects of traditional and digital media platforms on public opinion formation. The findings underscore the need for further research into the ethical implications of social media usage and its potential to shape democrati",

Utilising the PRISMA framework, the study analysed 19 articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases published between 2013-2023. The review identified five main categories of social media platforms discussed; Twitter/X, Meta (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), YouTube, Chinese apps (Sina Weibo, WeChat, QQ), and several unspecified platforms. Key themes emerged across these categories, including the role of social media in knowledge dissemination, creation of filter bubbles and echo chambers, amplification of diverse voices, and spread of misinformation. The findings highlighted social media potential for real-time public opinion monitoring, facilitating engagement between policymakers and citizens, and early identification of emerging issues. However, challenges such as information credibility and algorithmic curation of content were also noted. The review suggests that strategic use of social media can raise awareness and mobilise support for global initiatives like the Sustainable Development Goals. It emphasises the need for policymakers to understand and leverage social media's influence on public sentiment while addressing associated risks. The study contributes to a nuanced understanding of how different social media platforms shape public discourse and influence policy decisions in ",

With the rapid development of information and communication technology, social media platforms have changed the way people interact, share information, and express their views. The purpose of this study is to analyse the role of social media in shaping public opinion and its influence on economic decisions. This research uses a qualitative method. Data collection involved literature review and social media content analysis, focusing on opinion patterns and their influence. Reliability and validity were emphasised through triangulation and participation of secondary source participants in the analysis process. The study results show that in a digital age characterised by the central role of social media, it can be concluded that social media has a significant role in shaping public opinion and also influencing economic decision-making. Through social media, individuals and groups can interact with each other, share information, and participate in discussions that shape collective views on various issues.

This very interesting, and quite pervasive effect has gained increasing attention from researchers and psychologists, especially in today\u2019s digital landscape. An echo chamber refers to a self-reinforcing environment where individuals are repeatedly exposed to the same opinions and information, aligning with their pre-existing beliefs. This closed loop amplifies and affirms their views, often without challenge. While this phenomenon is prevalent in political discourse, it has spread widely across social media and online platforms, polarizing many aspects of society. To understand why these insulated information bubbles form, we need to explore the brain\u2019s role in seeking affirmation and how it affects human behavior. Understanding the Brain\u2019s Role in Echo Chambers At the core of the echo chamber effect lies neuroscience. The human brain is wired to seek comfort and certainty, making it naturally inclined to affirm its existing beliefs rather than confront conflicting information. This tendency is driven by confirmation bias, where our brain preferentially seeks out information that aligns with what we already believe. Studies show that when people are exposed to agreeable information, the brain\u2019s ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is activated, providing a sense of reward and reinforcing those beliefs. This neural mechanism helps explain why echo chambers are so attractive. Our brain feels validated when presented with confirming information, reducing cognitive dissonance\u2014the discomfort we feel when confronted with contradictory facts. In short, the echo chamber feeds our brain\u2019s desire for certainty and consistency, making it harder to challenge ingrained ideas. Echo Chambers vs. Filter Bubbles It\u2019s important to differentiate between echo chambers and filter bubbles. While an echo chamber is a space individuals actively choose to join, seeking out like-minded opinions, a filter bubble is more passive. Fi",

Do you ever feel like you\u2019re living in a bubble? A space where your beliefs and opinions are constantly reinforced, and alternative perspectives are nowhere to be found? Welcome to the world of echo chambers, a psychological phenomenon that has been amplified by the rise of social media filters. In this article, we will dive deep into understanding echo chambers, the psychology behind our beliefs, the influence of social media filters, and the profound psychological impact these echo chambers can have on our lives. So grab a cup of coffee and let\u2019s explore this intriguing subject together. Understanding Echo Chambers Before we delve into the effects of echo chambers, let\u2019s first define what they are and how they originate. Echo chambers can be described as virtual spaces where individuals are exclusively exposed to ideas, opinions, and information that align with their existing beliefs and values. Definition and Origin of Echo Chambers Echo chambers are not a new phenomenon. They date back to the early days of human civilization when likeminded people would gather together to affirm their shared beliefs. In today\u2019s digital age, however, echo chambers have been turbocharged by social media platforms that use complex algorithms to personalize our content consumption. Imagine a time when ancient tribes would gather around a fire, sharing stories and experiences that reinforced their collective worldview. This primitive form of an echo chamber served as a powerful tool for building trust and strengthening social bonds. As societies evolved, these echo chambers expanded to i",

REUTERS/Russell Boyce Executive summary\u00a0\u2191 Terms like echo chambers, filter bubbles, and polarisation are widely used in public and political debate but not in ways that are always aligned with, or based on, scientific work. And even among academic researchers, there is not always a clear consensus on exact definitions of these concepts. In this literature review we examine, specifically, social science work presenting evidence concerning the existence, causes, and effect of online echo chambers and consider what related research can tell us about scientific discussions online and how they might shape public understanding of science and the role of science in society. Echo chambers, filter bubbles, and the relationship between news and media use and various forms of polarisation has to be understood in the context of increasingly digital, mobile, and platform-dominated media environments where most people spend a limited amount of time with news and many internet users do not regularly actively seek out online news, leading to significant inequalities in news use. When defined as a bounded, enclosed media space that has the potential to both magnify the messages delivered within it and insulate them from rebuttal, studies in the UK estimate that between six and eight percent of the public inhabit politically partisan online news echo chambers. More generally, studies both in the UK and several other countries, including the highly polarised US, have found that most people have relatively diverse media diets, that those who rely on only one source typically converge on widely used sources with politically diverse audiences (such as commercial or public service broadcasters) and that only small minorities, often only a few percent, exclusively get news from partisan sources.

The internet has become a powerful tool for sharing ideas and opinions, making it a key platform for freedom of expression as well as press freedom. However, within the authoritarian regime context, this fundamental right is constantly under threat from online censorship. That is because, in today's digital age, online censorship has become a growing concern for many individuals and organisations. With the rise of authoritarian regimes around the world, the issue of online censorship has thus escalated to a new level.\u00a0 What is Online Censorship? To take things from the beginning, online censorship refers to any action taken to restrict or control access to content on the internet to limit the flow of information and ideas. This form of censorship can be carried out by governments, corporations, or other institutions for various reasons, such as maintaining political control, protecting national security, or enforcing social norms. This specific practice can range from blocking websites, filtering content, or completely shutting down the internet. What is more, the term \"authoritarian regime\" refers to a government with centralised power that restricts political opposition and suppresses dissent. In the context of the internet, this means filtering or blocking access to certain websites, social media platforms, or online content that is deemed threatening to the regime's power. Especially in authoritarian regimes, online censorship is often used to control the flow of information, with many instances that include using internet surveillance to identify and punish individuals who express views that are critical of the regime. One example of online censorship in an authoritarian regime is China's \"Great Firewall.\" This is a system of internet censor",

Certain powerful private entities\u00e2\u0080\u0094particularly social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and others\u00e2\u0080\u0094can limit, control, and censor speech as much or more than governmental entities. A society that cares for the protection of free expression needs to recognize that the time has come to extend the reach of the First Amendment to cover these powerful, private entities that have ushered in a revolution in terms of communication capabilities. While this article focuses on social media entities, the public/private distinction and the state action doctrine are important beyond cyberspace. The National Football League\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reaction to Colin Kaepernick and other players \u00e2\u0080\u009ctaking a knee\u00e2\u0080\u009d during the playing of the National Anthem is a pristine example of private conduct outside the reach of the First Amendment under current doctrine. But the nature of those protests couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem more public and cries out for a re-evaluation of the state action doctrine and the importance of protecting speech. Speaking of speech, two key justifications for robust protection of the First Amendment right to freedom of expression are the marketplace of ideas and individual self-fulfillment. These justifications don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t require governmental presence. Powerful private actors can infringe on free expression rights just as much as public actors. The first justification, the marketplace of ideas, is a pervasive metaphor in First Amendment law that posits the government should not distort the market and engage in content control. It is be",

Freedom of opinion and expression are, indeed, cornerstones of human rights and pillars of free and democratic societies. These freedoms support other fundamental rights, such as to peaceful assembly, to participate in public affairs, and to freedom of religion. It is undeniable that digital media, including social media, have bolstered the right to seek, receive and impart information and ideas. Therefore, legislative efforts to regulate free expression unsurprisingly raise concerns that attempts to curb hate speech may silence dissent and opposition. To counter hate speech, the United Nations supports more positive speech and upholds respect for freedom of expression as the norm. Therefore, any restrictions must be an exception and seek to prevent harm and ensure equality or the public participation of all. Alongside the relevant international human rights law ",

Cancel culture is a practice of withdrawing support for companies, public figures or celebrities because they have done something considered offensive. In our society it has always been common practice to hold people accountable when they air questionable or controversial opinions. However, cancel culture takes this to a whole new level. The cancel culture technique has negatively impacted on freedom of speech in its refusal to acknowledge contrary views.\u00a0 This type of \u2018group think\u2019 assumes that being accused is the same as being guilty. Banishing unpopular opinions puts society on the road to ideological authoritarianism. It endangers democracy, which upsets balance while rejecting diversity of views. In the United States\u2019 free speech is a political concept because it is written into the constitution. American freedom of speech includes the legal right to criticise your government and protects you from the government telling you what you can and cannot do. Freedom of speech is sacrosanct in the US and cannot be regulated by the government. However, the law does not protect you from public pressure; it protects you from the government.

But the internet \u2013 particularly social media \u2013 has changed how, when and where these kinds of interactions occur. The number of people who can go online and call out others for their behavior or words is immense, and it\u2019s never been easier to summon groups to join the public fray. The phrase\u00a0\u201ccancel culture\u201d is said to have originated\u00a0from a relatively obscure slang term \u2013 \u201ccancel,\u201d referring to\u00a0breaking up with someone\u00a0\u2013 used in a 1980s song. This term was then referenced in film and television and later evolved and gained traction on social media. Over the past several years, cancel culture has become a deeply contested idea in the nation\u2019s political discourse. There are plenty of debates over what it is and what it means, including whether it\u2019s a way to hold people accountable, or a tactic to punish others unjustly, or a mix of both. And some argue that cancel culture doesn\u2019t even exist. To better understand how the U.S. public views the concept of cancel culture, Pew Research Center asked Americans in September 2020 to share \u2013 in their own words \u2013 what they think the term means and, more broadly, how they feel about the act of calling out others on social media. The survey finds a public deeply divided, including over the very meaning of the phrase. Pew Research Center has a long history of studying the tone and nature of online discourse as well as emerging internet phenomena.\u00a0This report focuses on American adults\u2019 perceptions of cancel culture and, more generally, calling out others on social media. For this analysis, we surveyed 10,093 U.S. adults from Sept. 8 to 13, 2020.

You are encouraged to conduct your own independent research to supplement your argument. INTRODUCTION Cancel culture is one of the buzzwords of the social-media age. It describes the view that there is a new assault on freedom of expression and belief, beyond traditional free speech controversies like \u2018no-platforming\u2019. Cancel culture is a form of boycott where a person who has shared a controversial opinion, expressed an \u2018inappropriate\u2019 viewpoint, or whose actions are perceived as offensive, is called out and then \u2018cancelled\u2019 for their errant behaviour. It seems there is an example of a celebrity getting \u2018cancelled\u2019 every week. Author JK Rowling, singer Winston Marshall, radio presenter Danny Baker and actors Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson are just a few who have been fired and lost work for expressing their views. But it\u2019s not just limited to the world of celebrity. Harper\u2019s Magazine published a joint letter from a diverse range of 153 prominent writers, including Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood, concerned more generally that \u2018the free exchange of information and ideas, the lifeblood of a liberal society, is daily becoming more constricted\u2019 [Ref: Harper\u2019s Magazine]. But plenty of commentators think this is no threat to freedom of expression, arguing call-outs are the natural consequence of voicing prejudiced and bigoted opinions, and those who complain that they are held accountable are the ones really trying to crack down on freedom of speech [Ref: Varsity]. So, does this new culture stifle debate and jeopardise free speech, or is it merely what fair and open debate looks like in the social-media age? DEBATE IN CONTEXT Public shaming and moral panic are as old as society itself.

It metaphorically suggests a negative deterrence of communication: that a person or organisation is made physically colder by inhibiting the exercise of their right to free expression. The chilling effect is not an esoteric legal metaphor: journalists and campaign groups cite it frequently. It can, but does not have to mean, an outright obstruction of human rights relating to speech. \u2018Chilling\u2019 does not necessarily mean to make ice cold; the metaphorical suggestion of temperature suggests a scale of deterrence from cool to freezing. The chilling effect is used to describe overt censorship such as a government banning publication of a book, as well as more subtle controls such as ambiguous legislation and high legal costs that provoke uncertainty and fear among writers and journalists. The judiciary has played an important role in the popularisation of this highly flexible metaphor. Since the mid-1950s judges \u2013 first in the United States but now all over the world - have used it to explain decisions relating to individuals\u2019 and organisations\u2019 right to freedom of expression.

These editorial judgments are critical to online free expression because they create the distinctive speech environment of each service, shaping what users can say and what information they receive. But if the government disagrees with how a social media company makes these decisions, should it be able to threaten and coerce the company into changing its mind? This issue is at the heart of Twitter\u2019s case against Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, which challenges Paxton\u2019s issuance of a civil investigatory demand (CID) to Twitter in retaliation for Twitter\u2019s decision to bar President Trump from its service following the attack on the Capitol on January 6, 2021. The CID demands that Twitter turn over internal documents about how Twitter moderates content, as part of an \u201cinvestigation\u201d into whether Twitter\u2019s representations and practices about what can be posted on its platform violate the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection. As AG Paxton\u2019s public statements make clear, the true motivation is to retaliate against Twitter for exercising its First Amendment right to engage in content moderation. At issue before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals is the somewhat technical question of whether Twitter\u2019s claim of retaliation is \u201cripe,\u201d i.e., whether Twitter can bring suit now to challenge the CID as a violation of Twitter\u2019s First Amendment rights or whether it must wait until Paxton moves to enforce the CID in a separate proceeding. But this is no dry procedural question; the Court\u2019s decision could be of great importance to social media users and the general public, which rely on hosts to make important and timely moderation decisions regarding disinformation, hate speech, and harassment.

A law is vague when a person is unable to determine when certain speech or expressive conduct is protected by the First Amendment. A law is too broadly written when it might incidentally discourage legitimate free speech or conduct. Consider a 2010 U.S. Supreme Court decision in United States v.

Picture this: universities should be buzzing with the free exchange of ideas, a sort of intellectual all-you-can-eat buffet.

The internet has become a powerful tool for sharing ideas and opinions, making it a key platform for freedom of expression as well as press freedom. However, within the authoritarian regime context, this fundamental right is constantly under threat from online censorship. That is because, in today's digital age, online censorship has become a growing concern for many individuals and organisations. With the rise of authoritarian regimes around the world, the issue of online censorship has thus escalated to a new level.\u00a0 What is Online Censorship? To take things from the beginning, online censorship refers to any action taken to restrict or control access to content on the internet to limit the flow of information and ideas. This form of censorship can be carried out by governments, corporations, or other institutions for various reasons, such as maintaining political control, protecting national security, or enforcing social norms. This specific practice can range from blocking websites, filtering content, or completely shutting down the internet. What is more, the term \"authoritarian regime\" refers to a government with centralised power that restricts political opposition and suppresses dissent. In the context of the internet, this means filtering or blocking access to certain websites, social media platforms, or online content that is deemed threatening to the regime's power. Especially in authoritarian regimes, online censorship is often used to control the flow of information, with many instances that include using internet surveillance to identify and punish individuals who express views that are critical of the regime. One example of online censorship in an authoritarian regime is China's \"Great Firewall.\" This is a system of internet censor",

This study aims to explore the delayed and combinatory responses of online public opinion to the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: (a) Is there a temporal delay in the response of online public opinion to the intensity of the pandemic? (b) Does this delay exhibit general characteristics of social networks, such as combinatory effects and higher-order interactions? To address these questions, we employ natural language processing techniques to extract online public opinion data and utilize statistical and machine learning-based causal inference methods for analysis. The findings indicate that online public opinion\u2019s response to the intensity of COVID-19 is not immediate but rather exhibits a long-term lag. Identical COVID-19 intensity data can trigger multiple delayed public opinion responses, while a single delayed public opinion datum may be influenced by multiple preceding COVID-19 intensity data points. This delayed response of online public opinion and its higher-order network characteristics result in a waveform structure of real-world impacts influenced by online public opinion. We also utilized machine learning causal inference techniques to investigate the sensitivity differ",

Dissent is crucial for the advancement of science. Disagreement is at the heart of peer review and is important for uncovering unjustified assumptions, flawed methodologies and problematic reasoning. Enabling and encouraging dissent also helps to generate alternative hypotheses, models and explanations. Yet, despite the importance of dissent in science, there is growing concern that dissenting voices have a negative effect on the public perception of science, on policy-making and public health. In some cases, dissenting views are deliberately used to derail certain policies. For example, dissenting positions on climate change, environmental toxins or the hazards of tobacco smoke [1,2] seem to laypeople as equally valid conflicting opinions and thereby create or increase uncertainty. Critics often use legitimate scientific disagreements about narrow claims to reinforce the impression of uncertainty about general and widely accepted truths; for instance, that a given substance is harmful [3,4]. This impression of uncertainty about the evidence is then used to question particular policies [1,2,5,6]. The negative effects of dissent on establ",

In the wake of this violent insurrection against the certification of our election, the President and some of his supporters are claiming that the First Amendment rights of the President have been violated because of Twitter and Facebook\u2019s decisions to ban the President from use of their platforms. These claims come in a couple of forms. One form is the concern about the power that dominant social media platforms have and how they might use that power. Our Competition Policy Director, Charlotte Slaiman addresses that concern in her blog post, \u201cFacebook and Twitter Made the Right Decision. Big Tech Is Still Too Powerful.\u201d But the more fundamental question being raised is simple: Is this ban a violation of President Trump\u2019s First Amendment rights? It\u2019s essential that our country understands the answer to this question is no.

But there is serious debate about how to regulate our freedom of speech in the online sphere, particularly on social media. The rise of social media has implications for our fundamental rights, perhaps none more so than our freedom of speech. There is no doubt that our right to free speech extends online. But there is considerable and complex debate on how to regulate the online sphere, particularly social media. How the regulations are constructed, where the lines are drawn, will have huge implications for our freedom of speech on social media. What does free speech mean? Free speech means you have the freedom to express yourself in any way that does not take away the rights of other people. You can (and should) feel free to criticize the work your elected officials are doing. You should not feel free to hold band practice late into the night, because that could take away your neighbors\u2019 right to privacy. And when they complain about the noise, you can\u2019t encourage people to destroy their property or worse. But up to that point, you\u2019re free to express yourself. This is why free speech is so central to democracy. Democracy means that everyone in society makes collective decisions about the laws they live under and who administers them. The free exchange of ideas, opinions and information provide us with the knowledge we need to make those decisions. That\u2019s also why free speech and the organs that support it, such as free media and civil society, are often the first things that disappear in autocracies. And because we can\u2019t have democracy without free speech, we have to be careful about any actions that could limit it. We need independent voices to make decisions about which forms of expression are legitimate and which are not. This extends to the online world, where there\u2019s an ongoing struggle to balance the users\u2019 rights and the interests of tech companies and governments. Donate to l",

The survey was conducted in 19 advanced economies in North America, Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. For non-U.S. data, this report draws on nationally representative surveys of 20,944 adults from Feb. 14 to June 3, 2022. All surveys were conducted over the phone with adults in Canada, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea. Surveys were conducted face to face in Hungary, Poland and Israel. In Australia, we used a probability-based online panel. In the United States, we surveyed 3,581 U.S. adults from March 21 to 27, 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Technology use can be related to the way the survey is conducted. For example, our surveys in Malaysia, Singapore and South Korea are designed to only call mobile phone numbers and interview people on mobile phones because the prevalence of mobile phone ownership is so high.

They have the capacity and the potential to facilitate and improve the dissemination of news and other media products beyond traditional distribution platforms. Simultaneously, this also means a broader exposure of citizens to diverse content formats, sources of information as well as a plurality of viewpoints. Social media thus constitute a fundamental factor for news organizations to reach out to and interact with their audiences. This implies the necessary adaptation of \u201ctraditional\u201d media content to the characteristics of online platforms and their diverse audiences, much broader than just those represented by the consumers of legacy media. The emergence of social media platforms has also enhanced and transformed some of the traditional features of journalism as we knew it. Journalism is no longer the preserve of professional journalists. However, journalism activities are still characterized and framed by professional standards an",

Some of these national exceptions aim at preventing hate speech, defamation, or threats, while others aim at preventing speech which is considered in other countries as the mere expression of an opinion, albeit unsavory, but nevertheless legal. Social media sites allow the rapid spread of all speech, whether protected or not, and such messages spread around the world, and sometimes stir people into action. Social media played an important role in the Arab Spring, the London riots, and the Occupy Wall Street movements. But while the web links us all, each country nevertheless retains its own legal framework, and may or may not view a particular speech, such a blasphemy or l\u00e8se majest\u00e9, as legal. What is the purpose of these national exceptions to free speech (III)? Letting negative speech to be published has both positive and negative consequences. However, deciding whether a particular speech is worthy of protection, or not, is a slippery slope. Indeed, not every value is universally recognized, with the possible exceptions of safety and privacy. However, even then the laws balancing these two values with freedom of speech differ greatly in the U.S. and in Europe. Striking a balance between undeterred free speech and censorship to protect values considered worthy of protection is indeed a difficult exercise. Censorship of social media speech may not outweigh the benefit of forbidding a particular speech, but allowing complete free speech on social media may also have negative impacts, such as fostering cyber bullying or hate speech. Speech is not black or white, bad speech on one side and good speech on the other side. Who has the right to decide which speech must be suppressed on social media sites (",

While the primary effect of online repression is to silence criticism and forestall collective action, a secondary effect is to induce self-censorship among the masses. Yet scant research examines how self-censorship works, nor discusses its implications for entrenching authoritarianism and encouraging democratic backsliding. This article proposes a simple expected utility model of self-censorship, arguing that citizens will more likely self-censor when the expected costs of online political expression outweigh its benefits. Analysing the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer survey of 10,216 respondents across eight Southeast Asian countries, I find that higher income politically engaged social media users are indeed less likely to express their political opinions. Additionally, this correlation holds in states where online repression is most severe, but is non-existent in countries where online repression is moderate or low. read more Show Related Papers Chat with Paper Citations Sort by: Citation Count PDF Open Access More",

Social media provides new opportunities for people to express political opinions, and learn about the opinions of others, which could amplify the process. We propose that citizens expressing their political views on social media is an important component of contemporary political deliberation, meaning that the exacerbation of self-censoring behaviour poses a threat to democracy. Drawing on nationally representative surveys of online adults in France, Germany, UK and US we explore the existence of a spiral of silence on social media. Using hierarchical multiple regression models, we consider how the perceived opinion climate, political interest and ideology, and how people use social media, predicts self-censoring political opinions on social media. We find statistically significant, support for the spiral of silence on social media, and that political interest is significantly positively related to self-censorship in some countries, and not in others. Place on the political spectrum is not related to self-censorship in any country, but, the perceived importance of social media for politics is a significant and positive predictor of self-censorship across all four countries. These findings signal the continued relevance of the spiral of silence and the importance of considering individual agency in terms of how people choose to use social media for political communication. We also argue further cross-national comparisons are required. Introduction In a democracy the opportunity to speak freely and contribute to political deliberation is crucial (Dahlgren, 20",

For many, social media offers a new site of political debate, and a forum in which competing views can and should be exchanged. But, there is a great deal of concern about the existence of \u201cecho chambers\u201d: a dynamic within public political discourse where citizens speak only to, and hear only from others of the same ideological persuasion. This dynamic is commonly thought to have a negative impact both on democracy as a whole and on the political capacities of individual citizens. \"We have seen the vast majority of political conversations migrate to digital platforms, and the consequence of this migration is that we have discursively balkanized,\" said DSI Presidential Fellow Colin Kielty, a Ph.D. candidate in Politics. \"If you're concerned about the possibility that average citizens can have a part in the political process, the echo chamber thesis is damning.\" And for this reason, the vast majority of studies on the topic have been confined to establishing the existence and extent of the echo chamber effect; or, in addition, to determining whether certain ideological groups or issues are more likely to be stuck in an echo chamber than others. This approach, however, may fall prey to circular reasoning by using the same ideological variables to both define the outcome and to causally explain it. Moreover, they do not contribute to our understanding of how citizens can \u201cescape\u201d the echo chamber \u2013 by reaching broader and more diverse audiences \u2013 save by \u201ctoning down\u201d the ideological content of their online speech. Yet, citizens may take \u201ctoning down\u201d to be at cross-purposes with their reasons for engaging in online discourse in the first place, whether those reasons are to in fact to promote an unabashedly ideological cause by reaching the largest possible audience, or to build community around a cause with others of like mind. The question is not whether echo chambers exist, but if you can break free ",

In this literature review we examine, specifically, social science work presenting evidence concerning the existence, causes, and effect of online echo chambers and consider what related research can tell us about scientific discussions online and how they might shape public understanding of science and the role of science in society. Echo chambers, filter bubbles, and the relationship between news and media use and various forms of polarisation has to be understood in the context of increasingly digital, mobile, and platform-dominated media environments where most people spend a limited amount of time with news and many internet users do not regularly actively seek out online news, leading to significant inequalities in news use. When defined as a bounded, enclosed media space that has the potential to both magnify the messages delivered within it and insulate them from rebuttal, studies in the UK estimate that between six and eight percent of the public inhabit politically partisan online news echo chambers. More generally, studies both in the UK and several other countries, including the highly polarised US, have found that most people have relatively diverse media diets, that those who rely on only one source typically converge on widely used sources with politically diverse audiences (such as commercial or public service broadcasters) and that only small minorities, often only a few percent, exclusively get news from partisan sources.

And what role can institutions including higher education play in fostering an online environment that encourages respectful and productive discourse? \u00a0 Ernesto Falcon, Senior Legislative Counsel, Electronic Frontier Foundation \u00a0 \u00a0 The most powerful impact of the internet has been its capacity to distribute knowledge and culture at virtually no costs to the speaker. This has dramatically enhanced speech, which in turn has empowered democracy by enabling even the smallest voice to have an impact on our political discourse. Many of the major debates we have today stem from individuals who previously would have absolutely no means of communicating to the public. In other words, online speech remains vital to a 21st century democracy. In the era of mass media that preceded social media, only those in positions of power would have a voice to reach the public. These elite few traditionally came from the same backgrounds in education, wealth, and were often white. The internet democratized access to the public by giving every person this power. The distribution of power though has also enabled speakers of disfavored and unpopular content to share their ideas at scale. Our initial instincts reach for censorship of these speakers on the misunderstanding that suppressing ideas will force positive outcomes. In reality, democracy is built on openly confronting contradictory ideas in order for society to advance together. Institutions, such as higher education, must foster an understanding of the value and importance of online speech including disfavored and unpopular speech. Often past disfavored speech becomes the majority opinion through debate. Sanitization of internet speech will only prevent this critical process, which in turn only serves to make us ignorant of our fellow citizens. \u00a0 \u00a0 Shane Tews, Nonresident Senior Fellow, American Enterprise Institute \u00a0 \u00a0 In a society that values freedom of speech, we should recognize the nee",

This is an open access article under the terms of the http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ License, which permits use, distribution and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited. Abstract Anonymity promotes free speech by protecting the identity of people who might otherwise face negative consequences for expressing their ideas. Wrongdoers, however, often abuse this invisibility cloak. Defenders of anonymity online emphasise its value in advancing public debate and safeguarding political dissension. Critics emphasise the need for identifiability in order to achieve accountability for wrongdoers such as trolls. The problematic tension between anonymity and identifiability online lies in the desirability of having low costs (no repercussions) for desirable speech and high costs (appropriate repercussions) for undesirable speech. If we practice either full anonymity or identifiability, we end up having either low or high costs in all online contexts and for all kinds of speech. I argue that free speech is compatible with instituting costs in the form of repercussions and penalties for controversial and unacceptable speech. Costs can minimise the risks of anonymity by providing a reasonable degree of accountability. Pseudonymity is a tool that can help us regulate those costs while furthering free speech. This article argues that, in order to redesign the Internet to better serve free speech, we should shape much of it to resemble an online masquerade. Posting",

Thus, a more practical approach is urgently needed to deal with this dynamic and complicated phenomenon of propagating public opinion. This paper proposes that the outbreak of internet public opinion and its negative impacts, such as the occurrence of major security incidents, are a result of coupling and the complex interaction of many factors. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method model is composed of those factors and considers the stages of network information dissemination, the unique propagation rule, and textual sentiment resonance on the internet. Moreover, it is the first public opinion governance method that simultaneously highlights the complex system, functional identification, and functional resonance. It suggests a more effective method to shorten the dissipation time of negative public opinion and is a considerable improvement over previous models for risk-prediction. Based on resonance theory and deep learning, this study establishes public opinion resonance functions, which made it possible to analyze public opinion triggers and b",

The popularization and application of the Internet has brought great convenience to the people, promoted the communication and interaction between the government and the people, and added new ways of expressing public opinion; the Internet is highly developed, and the government makes full use of its role to collect social opinions through Internet. Public opinion promotes the democratization and scientific rationality of public policies. This article will discuss the following aspects: first, focus on the influence of online public opinion on public policy, explain the research background of the article, analyze and organize it; second, consult relevant literature, sort out the related concepts of online public opinion and public policy and characteristics; third, analyze the value of online public opinion on public policies, including positive and negative effects, based on cases, data, and referenced literature; finally, put forward targeted suggestions and countermeasures for existing problems, including improvement. The government plays an important role in the construction of network infrastructure and strengthening the moral education of netizens. It is necessary to do a good job in guiding the network public opinion, devote itself to creating a good and healthy network atmosphere, and attach importance to the dual influence of network public opinion on public policies, to make it fully play its positive role.

This study employs fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine 88 cases of major risk events in China from 2019 to 2023, categorized into natural disasters, accidents, social security threats, and public health crises. We propose an integrated theoretical framework combining information ecology theory and social mentality theory, aiming to uncover the driving pathways that shape positive and negative online social mentalities during these events. The findings reveal the following insights: (1) Media and government significantly influence online community attitudes during major natural disasters. (2) In major accidents, the social environment predominantly shapes stable aspects of societal mentality, yet media and government also adapt dynamically, influencing online societal attitudes accordingly. (3) Major social security events exhibit a diverse trajectory in online social mentality, underscoring the intricate factors affecting public sentiment. The study emphasizes the role of free agents in generating negative online attitudes. (4) During major public health crises, the scale of the event and media coverage exert considerable influence, with media responsiveness varying with shifts in event magnitude.

This paper creatively proposes a multi-stage risk grading model of Internet public opinion for public health emergencies. On the basis of general public opinion risk grading analysis, the model continuously pays attention to the risk level of Internet public opinion based on the time scale of regular or major information updates. This model combines Analytic Hierarchy Process Sort II (AHPSort II) and Swing Weighting (SW) methods and proposes a new Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method \u2013 AHPSort II-SW. Intuitionistic fuzzy number and linguistic fuzzy number are introduced into the model to evaluate the criteria that cannot be quantified. The multi-stage model is tested using more than 2,000 textual data about COVID-19 collected from Microblog, a leading social media platform in China. Seven public opinion risk assessments were conducted from January 23 to April 8, 2020. The empirical results show that in the early COVID-19 outbreak, the risk of public opinion is more serious on macr",

How Cancel Culture and Perp Walks May Undermine Trial Impartiality and Criminal Justice A simple internet search of the term \u2018cancel culture\u2019 produces a series of daily stories on how online shaming has impacted an increasing number of individuals and companies, raising new social and legal questions. The term refers to the practice of withdrawing support or completely rejecting public figures or companies after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensive, namely expressed through social media in the form of group shaming [1]. This modern form of ostracism against someone who is \u2018canceled\u2019 depends, above all, on a judgement made in the court of public opinion. Unlike courts within a legally well-established judicial system, courts of public opinion rely on trends and opinions which may or may not be grounded in factual evidence.\u00a0 Nonetheless, judgements in the courts of public opinion are not novel. Cancel culture appears to resemble the practice of perp walk, which is a scheduled public appearance where police officers escort a recently arrested individual in handcuffs through a public area where they can be photographed for the benefit of the media [2]. Especially in the United States, cancel culture and perp walks both open the possibility for the general public to produce its own judgement of the perp before the matter is addressed by the judicial system. This judgement is often facilitated by social media in the case of cancel culture, and it is not guided by any procedural rights or guarantees for the \u2018canceled\u2019 individual or the suspected criminal. The \u2018canceled\u2019 individual is tried under laws that have not been established within criminal or civil laws: social media users on any side of the political spectrum can unilaterally decide who should be \u2018canceled\u2019. While perp walk and cancel culture appear to be the modern-day public shaming sanctions, replacing those that date back to the Medieval Ages, modern procedural judicial rights have evolved s",

Abstract A conventional model of public opinion analysis is no longer suitable when the internet is the primary arena of information dissemination. Thus, a more practical approach is urgently needed to deal with this dynamic and complicated phenomenon of propagating public opinion. This paper proposes that the outbreak of internet public opinion and its negative impacts, such as the occurrence of major security incidents, are a result of coupling and the complex interaction of many factors. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method model is composed of those factors and considers the stages of network information dissemination, the unique propagation rule, and textual sentiment resonance on the internet.

American public opinion: the verdict is in Q&A with Maya Sen: Research survey shows nation\u2019s highest court to be closely aligned to views of American public on major issues decided this year You are here The United States Supreme Court issued rulings this year on some of the most vexing and polarizing issues on the national agenda: church vs. state, abortion, immigration, LGBGT rights, presidential powers. For the first time, citizens and court watchers could compare each ruling with the American public\u2019s attitudes on the issue under scrutiny. In May, Harvard Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy Maya Sen, Neil Malhotra of Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business, and Stephen Jessee of the University of Texas at Austin, published the findings of their new research collaboration called SCOTUSPoll. They surveyed opinions of 2,000 Americans on the issues the court was taking up, and they reported the results as the court\u2019s decisions were unfolding. When the court ruled last week in the final big decision of this year\u2019s term that President Trump did not have a blanket right to withhold his financial records from prosecutors, the New York Times cited SCOTUSPoll in a front-page graphic putting the decision in the context of public opinion. The researchers also have drawn coverage from the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, and other publications. Maya Sen is a political scientist who writes on issues involving the political economy of U.S. race relations, law and politics, and statistical methods. Her latest book, Deep Roots: How Slavery Still Shapes Southern Politics, won the 2019 William H. Riker Prize for best book in political economy. Her next book, on how American courts become politicized, is being published by Cambridge University Press later this year. \u00a0 Q: What prompted you to undertake this project?

President and Fellows of Harvard College decision, which struck down the use of race as an explicit factor in college admissions decisions; and the recent 303 Creative LLC et al. v.

Two travesties persist in tainting access by all to the U.S. legal system. One is the gaping lack of access to justice. The Legal Services Corporation estimates that 92% of the civil legal problems of the roughly 50 million low-income Americans receive no or insufficient legal help. Reasonable minds can quibble over that number \u2013 some say it is exaggerated \u2013 but no one doubts or disputes that the legal system falls dramatically short of serving those who need it, not just for those with low incomes, but also for the middle class and small businesses. The other is the continuing lack of public access to the law. For both primary and secondary legal materials, many remain under the commercial lock and key of major publishers, or under dubious claims of copyright by government entities, or so disparately and poorly organized as to be effectively inaccessible. As to both these travesties, there are many individuals, groups and organizations working hard to resolve them. For the most part, however, it seems that they work along separate tracks, pursuing parallel missions but employing separate strategies. Yet the fact is that these two travesties \u2013 and their hoped-for resolutions \u2013 are inextricably intertwined. We can never fully resolve the access to justice crisis unless we also resolve the lack of free and open access to the law. For many with legal problems, simply knowing the law and their rights is the first step toward achieving a resolution. What this means, perhaps, is that there should be greater coordination and collaboration between those working to close the justice gap and those working to free the law. On both fronts, these are major fights, but in unity, as they say, there is strength. Separate Summits Once again, the fodder for these ruminations came from two parallel conferences.

Most court web sites will post opinions and make them available for download on the same day they are issued. On the other hand, some courts remove older opinions from sites rather than maintain an archive. The federal courts, for example, remove some older opinions and place them on PACER, which requires a subscription and incurs access charges for documents other than opinions. Legislative documents are not always posted with the same speed, particularly transcripts or proceedings, but usually appear on an official site before a paper version becomes available, if one becomes available at all. Agency reports or documents that are created in the course of agency business usually appear on an agency\u2019s site around the same time as their public release. Another advantage is the broad range of documents that are available. Obscure documents include policy statements, forms, studies, reports, and smaller information collections. Law libraries do not necessarily carry these documents in print within their collections. They rely on the Internet as the major source of access for these materials. A rule of thumb is that irregularly issued documents from any official source are more likely to appear on the Internet than Lexis or Westlaw. A disadvantage is that the format of a document taken from the Internet may be difficult to cite. That has to do with how courts accept authentication of a document. The current standard is to recognize print collections as the official source of cases when both a print and online version exists. The only jurisdictions to abandon official printed reporters for case law entirely are Arkansas and Illinois. Beginning with opinion issued in 2009, the official source for Arkansas case law is the Arkansas court web site, though opinions will still be published by West in the Southwestern Reporter. Arkansas still requires citation to the Southwestern Reporter ",

Prior to Free Access to Legal Information Since the mid-1990s the Internet\u2019s World-Wide-Web has provided the necessary technical platform to enable free access to computerised legal information. Prior to the web there were many online legal information systems, and numerous legal information products distributed on CD-ROM, but there was no significant provision of free access to legal information anywhere in the world. Both government and private sector online legal publishers charged for access. The web provided the key element required for free public access \u2013 a low cost distribution mechanism. For publishers it was close to a \u201cno cost\u201d distribution mechanism if they were not required to pay for outgoing bandwidth. The ease of use of graphical browsers from around 1994, and the web\u2019s use of hypertext as its principal access mechanism (at that time) meant that the web provided a simple and relatively consistent means by which legal information could be both provided and accessed, an ",

History Lesson\r The idea that criminal court proceedings are accessible by the public is a pillar of our justice system, rooted in the First Amendment. This public right to unrestricted access in criminal and civil court proceedings has been interpreted by many states to extend to court documents and court records (as long as not otherwise protected). Traditionally, public access to court proceedings and records has been limited to those taking place in the courthouse, between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:00 pm. In most every other aspect of our lives, we have 24/7 access to everything from live streaming of our home security systems, to ordering our groceries or dinner from our mobile devices \u2014 while traveling\u00a0at 30,000 feet! Government \u2014 and courts in particular \u2014 has been slow to follow in the rush to 24/7 electronic accessibility. Part of the rationale behind the hesitation to jump on the electronic bandwagon, are the ethical issues surrounding unlimited electronic public access. So while the First Amendment provides for public access to information, conversely the Fourteenth Amendment interprets the definition of \u201cliberty\u201d to include a right to privacy. Deciding between these two semmingly contradictory rights becomes a challenge for courts when determining what form of electronic access is appropriate for court documents. The pros\r Unlimited electronic access to publicly available documents: The cons\r While there are compelling reasons to provide electronic public access, they don\u2019t take into account the potential for it to be used inappropriately.

The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution guarantee due process rights, stating that no person shall be \u201cdeprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d This fundamental principle ensures that government actions are not arbitrary and that individuals have a right to be heard in a fair and impartial system. However, the situation becomes more complicated when we consider how \u201csocial media platforms\u201d control narratives, censor content, and decide what speech is acceptable or not. Although these platforms are private companies, they still have a profound impact on public discourse and individual freedoms. Many argue that social media platforms often disregard due process, manipulating narratives, silencing opposing views, and making decisions that affect individuals\u2019 lives without accountability. In this article, we\u2019ll explore why social media platforms sometimes don\u2019t respect due process, the underlying issues such as greed, corruption, and control, and discuss potential remedies to ensure rights are respected in the digital age. Why Social Media Platforms Don\u2019t Respect Due Process 1. Money and Lobbying: The Power of Influence One significant reason social media platforms don\u2019t always respect due process is because of their financial and political influence. These platforms have massive resources at their disposal, which they often use to lobby government bodies to shape regulations in their favor. For example, consider the way large tech companies such as Facebook, Twitter (now X), and Google have lobbied Congress and various governmental bodies over the years. These platforms influence lawmakers through political contributions, campaign support, and lobbying efforts. This allows them to steer leg",

Are social media TOS invalid because lack of due process and mutuality creates an unenforceable illusory contract? Generally speaking, the TOS of social media platforms share certain common features. They do not give the user the right to any \"due process.\" If the platform wishes to cancel, block or suspend the user, they can do so with impunity. The platform can exercise its sole discretion and the user has no right to due process or a fair hearing. Even worse, these social media platforms routinely engage in the practice of so-called \"shadow banning.\" This practice effectively cuts off users from accessing the platform with an elaborate ruse and conspiracy designed to deceive the user into believing they still are using the platform normally. But, in fact, all their posts are disappeared into the either by the platform to intentionally trick the user into wasting their time creating more posts that go nowhere. My hypothesis is that these common practices (deceptive shadow banning ruse conspiracy, lack of due process, no right to any appeal or fair hearing and lack of mutuality -- the platform can do whatever they want with autonomous impunity and the user can't even register a complaint) combined with the plain language of the TOS of these social media platforms that grant complete autonomous impunity to the platform constitutes an ILLUSORY CONTRACT and, therefore, renders the TOS invalid in their entirety. Does my hypothesis have any merit? I am using the following",

How this unauthoritative source influences our discourse and decisions is hard to reliably trace. But a new study attempts to measure how knowledge gleaned from Wikipedia may play out in one specific realm: the courts. A team of researchers led by Neil Thompson, a research scientist at MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), recently came up with a friendly experiment: creating new legal Wikipedia articles to examine how they affect the legal decisions of judges. They set off by developing over 150 new Wikipedia articles on Irish Supreme Court decisions, written by law students. Half of these were randomly chosen to be uploaded online, where they could be used by judges, clerks, lawyers, and so on \u2014 the \u201ctreatment\u201d group. The other half were kept offline, and this second group of cases provided the counterfactual basis of what would happen to a case absent a Wikipedia article about it (the \u201ccontrol\u201d). They then looked at two measures: whether the cases were more likely to be cited as precedents by subsequent judicial decisions, and whether the argumentation in court judgments echoed the linguistic content of the new Wikipedia pages.\u00a0 It turned out the published articles tipped the scales: Getting a public Wikipedia article increased a case\u2019s citations by more than 20 percent. The increase was statistically significant, and the effect was particularly strong for cases that supported the argument the citing judge was making in their decision (but not the converse).

Methodology: The study adopted a desktop research methodology. Desk research refers to secondary data or that which can be collected without fieldwork. Desk research is basically involved in collecting data from existing resources hence it is often considered a low cost technique as compared to field research, as the main cost is involved in executive\u2019s time, telephone charges and directories. Thus, the study relied on already published studies, reports and statistics. This secondary data was easily accessed through the online journals and library. Findings: The findings reveal that there exists a contextual and methodological gap relating to the influence of social media on judicial independence. Preliminary empirical review revealed that social media exerted considerable pressure on judicial processes, potentially compromising judges' independence due to increased scrutiny and criticism. It found that misinformation and sensationalism on social media significantly eroded public trust in the judiciary, leading to distorted perceptions of judicial fairness. Judges were often influenced, consciously or subconsciously, by social media discourse, affecting their decision-making processes. The study highlighted the need for ongoing attention and research to understand and mitigate these influences, ensuring the preservation and strengthening of j",

Previous research has relied predominantly on quantitative approaches. This paper brings a new perspective by employing a different strategy. Based on in-depth interviews with justices of the Czech Constitutional Court, it shows how elite judges think about public opinion and media, and the influence of these on judicial decision-making. The paper creates a typology of different judicial styles and attitudes towards media and public opinion. It shows that one polar category of judges employs deliberate strategies to affect the media and draw public opinion on their side. In contrast, the opposite one seeks to minimize or even avoid public and media exposure. Introduction \u201cNo judge lives in isolation. Therefore, I am conscious of public opinion polls, various petitions, newspaper articles, discussions, proclamations of politicians and lawyers, and public assemblies\u2026 Judges in democracies cannot win public trust by seeking publicity and following public moods. They can win trust only by deciding according to law, without regard to public opinion.\u201d1 This quote, from a former Slovak Constitutional Court President, represents the position of many judges across the globe \u2013 they live ordinary lives just as other people do. However, when deciding cases, they should forget about the outside world and strictly follow the law. Nevertheless, various strands of sociolegal literature have documented how extralegal factors affect judicial decision-making. Most prominently studied influences include the political ideology of judges,2 judges\u2019 strategic considerations,3 structural political determinants,4 and public opinion and media.5 Despite the immense volume of research on judicial decision-making, scholars rarely engage directly with ",

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes.

The current paper explores whether online shaming is motivated by a person's desire to do good (a justice motive); and/or, because it feels good (a hedonic motive), specifically, as a form of pleasure at witnessing another's misfortune (schadenfreude). We examine two key aspects of social media that may moderate these processes: anonymity (Study 1) and social norms (the responses of other users; Studies 2\u20133). Across three experiments (N\u00a0\\=\u00a0225, 198, 202) participants were presented with a fabricated news article featuring an instance of Islamophobia and given the opportunity to respond. Participants' concerns about social justice were not directly positively associated with online shaming and had few consistent indirect effects on shaming via moral outrage. Rather, justice concerns were primarily associated with shaming via participants' perception that the offender was deserving of negative consequences, and their feelings of schadenfreude regarding these consequences. Anonymity did not moderate this process and there was mixed evidence for the qualifying effect of social norms. Overall, the current studies point to the hedonic motive in general and schadenfreude specifically as a key moral emotion associated with people'",

Now, thanks to the Internet, those words (and worse) can be sent, sometimes unjustifiably, to millions around the world. Our Cover Story is reported by David Pogue of Yahoo Finance: Last Friday night, Kyle Quinn, an assistant professor at the University of Arkansas, was enjoying a pleasant night out with his wife at Crystal Bridges Museum in Bentonville, Ark. \"I saw some nice art exhibits with my wife, and we went to dinner up there and just had a lovely evening,\" he told Pogue. Suddenly, there was an inkling that something was amiss. \"A lot of frantic emails from the university, trying to reach me. And I thought that my weekend was about to be ruined.\" While Quinn was at that museum in Arkansas, white supremacists were gathering in Charlottesville, Virginia -- and on the Internet, outraged onlookers misidentified Quinn as one of the participants. Did he think there was a resemblance? \"Not really. I understand, I've got a beard!\" he laughed. \"I understand that some people could see a resemblance there. But anyone that knows me knew right away that that's not me.\" But people who didn't know Quinn decided that he had to be punished. He began receiving \"really vulgar messages that you could never air. There were messages coming to my email, messages on my work phone. Things on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook as well.\" \u00a0The messages implied that he was a racist. That was Kyle Quinn's introduction to a modern form of public humiliation known as Internet shaming, where online mobs descend upon one person in a wildly out-of-proportion attack. Quinn felt his personal safety was threatened. \"The most troubling thing to me and my wife, really, was, someone identified where we live, our home address. Any time you have an angry mob and someone says, 'Hey, this is where the guy lives,' that's a threat in my book. So we decided to head over to a ",

BY Gail Ablow | September 21, 2016 Sign Here to Save the World: Online Petitions Explained A reader, Harriet Glickman, asks: \u201cHas anyone examined whether the four to five petitions people like me sign online every day have any effect at all on legislators, corporations, etc., to whom they are directed? Of course I know many of them are just another way to get donations but the issues and problems they address are real. I\u2019d like to know if they actually make a difference. Any thoughts?\u201d Short answer: It turns out many people are studying digital activism \u2014 writing papers, holding conferences, generating digital business models and coining terms like \u201cslactivism.\u201d There\u2019s even a definition in the Oxford English Dictionary: slacktivism (also slactivism) informal [MASS NOUN] Actions performed via the internet in support of a political or social cause but regarded as requiring little time or involvement, e.g. signing an online petition or joining a campaign group on a social media website or application. Online petitions are a tactic that have been used in many successful campaigns, from stopping the Keystone XL Pipeline to preserving net neutrality. A Petition is a Tactic Dave Karpf, a professor at George Washington University and author of The MoveOn Effect: The Unexpected Transformation of American Political Advocacy, says online petitions are an early-stage political tactic that help build a broader campaign and serve a number of purposes: They can send a signal of public opinion to a decision maker.

Based on current research in the space, most online petitions fail to reach their goals and gather enough signatures to have an impact as they seem to be dependent on mass media coverage for success, therefore illustrating the importance of actively garnering media coverage when initiating a petition. As illustrated on the White House\u2019s We The People petition platform, out of the 268 petitions that reached the signature threshold required for a response from the White House, only three concrete instances of a legislative outcome. Other petition platforms, such as Change.org, may foster a false perception of activism where anyone can become an \u201cinterested bystander\u201d for a particular cause where their \u201cSlacktivism\u201d main effect is to increase their own feel-good factor, rather than creating concrete impact on the cause. Online petition platforms like Change.org, by themselves, will induce attention towards a certain social issue and it is only when this attention is focused through an organized plan of action,\u00a0 change can be accomplished. Activism vs. Slacktivism Activism in itself is defined as the process by which groups of people exert pressure on organizations or other institutions to change policies, practices, or conditions activists find problematic. Traditionally, before the internet, activism was demonstrated through physical activities, such as strikes, boycotts, sit-ins",

There are some federal laws that are meant to protect us but others vary from state to state. Below we will walk you through some key definitions you might need when talking to a lawyer and/or law enforcement, what federal and state laws are there to keep you safe, as well as what to expect if you go to the police. Please keep in mind that this guide is not intended as legal advice. Law in this area is constantly evolving and it is best to contact a lawyer in your state if you want the most up-to-date information and legal guidance. Risk Assessment We understand that assessing if an online threat might become real in offline spaces is one of the most challenging processes when dealing with online harassment. Unfortunately, there is not a \u201cperfect\u201d answer to how to determine if an online attack could turn into a physical attack or if you need to involve legal authorities. Each case needs to be evaluated on an individual basis. Ultimately, you will have to examine your case and use your best judgment when deciding what steps you want to take to combat online harassment. You should also consider legal advice and contact professionals who can help you with this process. (See below) We can give you some ideas of how to do a risk assessment to determine if you are at risk. For instance, you can start by responding to the following questions: Are you receiving violent threats, including rape or death threats that include references to specific locations like your home address or places you often visit like your workplace? For example, in the U.S, some states will only classify behavior as cyberstalking if it includes a \u201ccredible threat,\u201d which usuall",

Introduction II. Federal Legislation Relevant to Online Harassment of Journalists III. State-Level Laws Relevant to Online Harassment of Journalists The Australian Constitution does not expressly guarantee freedom of expression or speech. However, the High Court of Australia has held that there is an implied constitutional guarantee of freedom of political communication. In addition, protections for freedom of speech are found in the common law and in Australia\u2019s international obligations. Various legislative provisions, including criminal law provisions, restrict freedom of speech. There are no specific provisions in Australian federal, state, or territory laws that deal with the online harassment of journalists. However, a general provision in the federal Criminal Code can be used to prosecute cyberbullying or cyberstalking of different forms. In addition, state and territory provisions related to threats and stalking may be applicable. There are also criminal provisions related to the nonconsensual sharing of intimate images, as well as a national-level compla",

Ward Digital media ethics deals with the distinct ethical problems, practices and norms of digital news media. Digital news media includes online journalism, blogging, digital photojournalism, citizen journalism and social media. It includes questions about how professional journalism should use this \u2018new media\u2019 to research and publish stories, as well as how to use text or images provided by citizens. A revolution in ethics A media revolution is transforming, fundamentally and irrevocably, the nature of journalism and its ethics. The means to publish is now in the hands of citizens, while the internet encourages new forms of journalism that are interactive and immediate. Our media ecology is a chaotic landscape evolving at a furious pace.\u00a0 Professional journalists share the journalistic sphere with tweeters, bloggers, citizen journalists, and social media users. Amid every revolution, new possibilities emerge while old practices are threatened. Today is no exception. The economics of professional journalism struggles as audiences migrate online. Shrinkage of newsrooms creates concern for the future of journalism. Yet these fears also prompt experiments in journalism, such as non-profit centers of investigative journalism.

The media provide many lessons about law and justice. In the average American household, a TV set is on for over 7 hours each day, and individual members of the family watch television for about 3 hours. Television news and police and crime dramas account for a substantial amount of incidental learning about the nature of the legal system. Newspapers and films also contribute to the public's knowledge and attitudes about law and the legal system. This contribution reviews and analyzes the impact of this coverage of law on the public. First, we consider how the media present law, crime, and justice. Our analysis of the content and style of media coverage of legal issues leads to the conclusion that the media mirror presents a distorted view of law. We then discuss the impact of these media distortions on people's knowledge of and attitudes toward law and crime. We conclude with an examination of the effect of media coverage of courtroom trials on juries, the people's representative in court.

The way the general public views court cases is significantly influenced by media coverage. The media frequently pays close attention to high-profile trials, covering and analyzing them. The public's perception of these cases can be greatly influenced by how they are presented in the media, which can lead to prejudices and preconceptions that could affect how impartial the trial is. A narrative that may not fully reflect the differences of the situation may be created as a result of sensationalized reporting, selective fact framing, and the use of emotive language. As a result, media portrayals may influence juries and the general public, distorting the course of justice. Moreover, the widespread",

Mass Media, Crime, and Criminal Justice in the US May 21, 2024 | Criminal Justice | Georgia Schumacher In the United States, the mass media significantly shapes our perceptions of crime and justice. It influences attitudes, policies, and even the criminal justice system. Understanding this relationship is crucial for anyone working in or studying criminal justice. How We Perceive Crime and Justice What society considers a crime or justice is not set in stone or based solely on objective facts. Instead, factors like culture, values, and norms carry weight. In simpler terms, the public decides what behaviors are crimes based on our beliefs and rules. These beliefs can change over time or vary between different communities. Something that is seen as a crime in one place or time might not be considered a crime somewhere else or at a different time. So, a crime isn't just about what someone does wrong, but also how society sees it. What role does the media have in all this? The news influences our attitudes and perceptions. What we see in the media shapes our ideas on which crimes are the most offensive. It suggests to us what criminals are like, what motivates them, and how to manage them and their crimes. The media constructs narratives with selective reporting, sensationalism, and framing. Often, those narratives do not match reality. Certain crimes, particularly ones that are violent or sensational, receive higher coverage. This coverage skews our understanding of crime prevalence and risk. Sensationalized stories also stoke fear and anxiety. This fear can inspire calls for harsher punishments and more aggressive law enforcement measures. Moreover, the portrayal of perpetrators and victims can reinforce stereotypes and biases, shaping attitudes toward particular groups or communities. On the other hand, sympathetic depictions of defendants or victims may generate support for criminal justice reforms. The framing of crime narratives can also influence public opinio",

Newspapers, radio, television, and new media not only spread information, but also help to determine what topics and stories people talk about. Many crimes receive extensive media coverage, which provides a challenge for prosecutors, as well as defendants and defense attorneys, when it comes to trying a case. Juries are supposed to be unbiased when deciding a case, despite the news coverage they may have come across before trial. Police officers involved in criminal cases may become entangled with the media in the process of providing information about a case.

Previous research has relied predominantly on quantitative approaches. This paper brings a new perspective by employing a different strategy. Based on in-depth interviews with justices of the Czech Constitutional Court, it shows how elite judges think about public opinion and media, and the influence of these on judicial decision-making. The paper creates a typology of different judicial styles and attitudes towards media and public opinion. It shows that one polar category of judges employs deliberate strategies to affect the media and draw public opinion on their side. In contrast, the opposite one seeks to minimize or even avoid public and media exposure. Introduction \u201cNo judge lives in isolation. Therefore, I am conscious of public opinion polls, various petitions, newspaper articles, discussions, proclamations of politicians and lawyers, and public assemblies\u2026 Judges in democracies cannot win public trust by seeking publicity and following public moods. They can win trust only by deciding according to law, without regard to public opinion.\u201d1 This quote, from a former Slovak Constitutional Court President, represents the position of many judges across the globe \u2013 they live ordinary lives just as other people do. However, when deciding cases, they should forget about the outside world and strictly follow the law. Nevertheless, various strands of sociolegal literature have documented how extralegal factors affect judicial decision-making. Most prominently studied influences include the political ideology of judges,2 judges\u2019 strategic considerations,3 structural political determinants,4 and public opinion and media.5 Despite the immense volume of research on judicial decision-making, scholars rarely engage directly with ",

Prior experimental and observational studies come to conflicting conclusions because of methodological limitations. We argue that existing studies overlook the media\u2019s critical role in communicating Court decisions and theorize that major decisions change Americans\u2019 opinions most when the media offer one-sided coverage supportive of the Court majority. We fielded nationally representative surveys shortly before and after two major Supreme Court decisions on health care and immigration and connected our public opinion data with six major television networks\u2019 coverage of each decision. We find that Court decisions can influence national opinion and increase support for policies the Court upholds as constitutional. These effects were largest among people who received one-sided information. To address selection concerns, we combined this observational study with an experiment and find that people who first heard about the Court decisions through the media and through the experiment responded in similar ways.

I am rather surprisingly unable to find answers via Google - I find lots of papers that investigate whether judges are influenced by public opinion, which is tangential to the questions. This is the only relevant result I've found, but it's a only one result so it might not be representative. 9 Answers 9 united-states In the US Judges are generally not supposed to take public opinion into account, nor the views of executive officials, except as those are expressed in briefs or other documents submitted during a case. This is part of the \"Independence of the Judiciary\" or \"Judicial Independence\" Where a court has been too strongly influenced by short-term public opinion in a criminal case, this has been held to be a violation of Due Process, as was noted in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932) although the main issue there was the right to Counsel (a lawyer). In the opinion it is said that: It is perfectly apparent that the proceedings, from beginning to end, took place in an atmosphere of tense, hostile and excited public sentiment. (287 U. S. 51) However guilty defendants, upon due inquiry, might prove to have been, they were, until convicted, presumed to be innocent. It was the duty of the court having their cases in charge to see that they were denied no necessary incident of a fair trial. (287 U. S. 53) In The Federalist #78 Hamilton wrote: ... from the natural feebleness of the judiciary, it is in continua",

However, as social media\u2019s influence continues to grow, its impact on legal proceedings cannot be ignored. From influencing public opinion to presenting potential evidence, social media has both positive and negative implications for the legal system. The Power of Public Opinion: Social media platforms have given a voice to the masses, allowing individuals to express their opinions freely and instantaneously. This freedom of expression has the potential to sway public opinion and influence legal proceedings. High-profile cases are often accompanied by intense online discussions, debates, and sometimes even campaigns that can exert pressure on the justice system. While public awareness and involvement can be beneficial in ensuring justice, the challenge lies in separating fact from fiction, as misinformation can spread rapidly. Discovering and Presenting Evidence: Social media platforms have become treasure troves of information for legal professionals. They can be valuable sources for gathering evidence, especially in cases involving cyberbullying, defamation, or harassment. Pictures, videos, posts, and messages shared on social media can provide crucial insights into an individual\u2019s activities, intentions, or connections.

While the court\u2019s ruling was procedural, it was nonetheless a stark repudiation of two lower courts in the South, and their eagerness to embrace conspiracy theories about alleged government coercion of social media companies. Untangling Disinformation What it means for the election that the government can talk to tech companies Writing for a liberal-conservative coalition of six justices, Justice Amy Coney Barrett said that neither the five individuals nor the two states who sued the government had legal standing to be in court at all. She said they presented no proof to back up their claims that the government had pressured social media companies like Twitter and Facebook into restricting their speech. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she said, the Fifth Circuit court of appeals \u201crelied on factual findings that are \u201cclearly erroneous.\u201d For instance, she said, the plaintiffs who brought the case maintained that the White House had bombarded Twitter with requests to set up a streamlined process for censorship requests. But in fact, she said, the record showed no such requests. Rather, on one occasion a White House official asked Twitter to remove a fake account pretending to be the account of Biden\u2019s granddaughter. Twitter took down the fake account and told the official about a portal that could be used in the future to flag similar issues. \u201cJustice Barrett went out of her way to stress that facts matter and that lower courts in this case embraced a fact-free version of what transpired between officials in the Biden administration and Facebook, Twitter and other social media",

Mass Media, Crime, and Criminal Justice in the US May 21, 2024 | Criminal Justice | Georgia Schumacher In the United States, the mass media significantly shapes our perceptions of crime and justice. It influences attitudes, policies, and even the criminal justice system. Understanding this relationship is crucial for anyone working in or studying criminal justice. How We Perceive Crime and Justice What society considers a crime or justice is not set in stone or based solely on objective facts. Instead, factors like culture, values, and norms carry weight. In simpler terms, the public decides what behaviors are crimes based on our beliefs and rules. These beliefs can change over time or vary between different communities. Something that is seen as a crime in one place or time might not be considered a crime somewhere else or at a different time. So, a crime isn't just about what someone does wrong, but also how society sees it. What role does the media have in all this? The news influences our attitudes and perceptions. What we see in the media shapes our ideas on which crimes are the most offensive. It suggests to us what criminals are like, what motivates them, and how to manage them and their crimes. The media constructs narratives with selective reporting, sensationalism, and framing. Often, those narratives do not match reality. Certain crimes, particularly ones that are violent or sensational, receive higher coverage. This coverage skews our understanding of crime prevalence and risk. Sensationalized stories also stoke fear and anxiety. This fear can inspire calls for harsher punishments and more aggressive law enforcement measures. Moreover, the portrayal of perpetrators and victims can reinforce stereotypes and biases, shaping attitudes toward particular groups or communities. On the other hand, sympathetic depictions of defendants or victims may generate support for criminal justice reforms. The framing of crime narratives can also influence public opinio",

However, the ephemeral and easily manipulated nature of social media presents unique challenges. For instance, Rule 901 requires that the proponent of the evidence must establish its authenticity, a task that can be daunting when dealing with digital footprints that can be forged or misrepresented.

For the first time, citizens and court watchers could compare each ruling with the American public\u2019s attitudes on the issue under scrutiny. In May, Harvard Kennedy School Professor of Public Policy Maya Sen, Neil Malhotra of Stanford\u2019s Graduate School of Business, and Stephen Jessee of the University of Texas at Austin, published the findings of their new research collaboration called SCOTUSPoll. They surveyed opinions of 2,000 Americans on the issues the court was taking up, and they reported the results as the court\u2019s decisions were unfolding. When the court ruled last week in the final big decision of this year\u2019s term that President Trump did not have a blanket right to withhold his financial records from prosecutors, the New York Times cited SCOTUSPoll in a front-page graphic putting the decision in the context of public opinion. The researchers also have drawn coverage from the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, and other publications. Maya Sen is a political scientist who writes on issues involving the political economy of U.S. race relations, law and politics, and statistical methods. Her latest book, Deep Roots: How Slavery Still Shapes Southern Politics, won the 2019 William H. Riker Prize for best book in political economy.

By the Annenberg Public Policy Center Photo Credit:\u00a0Fine Photographics / Unsplash Trust that the U.S. Supreme Court is operating in the best interests of the American people has plummeted amid growing perceptions that the justices are partisans just like any other politicians, according to the latest Annenberg Public Policy Center survey, which includes questions tracking the court across more than a decade and a half. The survey, which was conducted in August, two months after the Supreme Court overturned the 49-year-old Roe v. Wade ruling guaranteeing a constitutional right to abortion, finds that 53% of U.S. adults disapprove of how the court handles its job. The survey also reveals a chasm between the qualities the American people say they value most in judges, such as fairness and impartiality, and the traits they perceive in Supreme Court justices. In most of the years the policy center has conducted this survey, differences in trust in the court by party affiliation have not been meaningful. That changed in 2022, with a wide gap separating Republicans from Democrats and independents on some attitudes toward the court. \u201cWhether the perceptions registered in our survey are justified or not, they are worrisome,\u201d said Annenberg Public Policy Center Director Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who has directed the survey since its inception in 2005. \u201cFor the court to play its role in our system of government, it is important that it be perceived to be an independent branch that impartially and fairly bases its decisions on the Constitution, the law, and the facts of the case.\u201d The Supreme Court questions were part of the Annenberg Constitution Day Civics Survey, a nationally representative survey conducted annually for Constitution Day (Sept. 17) by the Annenberg Public Policy Center (APPC) of the University of Pennsylvania.

Previous research has relied predominantly on quantitative approaches. This paper brings a new perspective by employing a different strategy. Based on in-depth interviews with justices of the Czech Constitutional Court, it shows how elite judges think about public opinion and media, and the influence of these on judicial decision-making. The paper creates a typology of different judicial styles and attitudes towards media and public opinion. It shows that one polar category of judges employs deliberate strategies to affect the media and draw public opinion on their side. In contrast, the opposite one seeks to minimize or even avoid public and media exposure. Introduction \u201cNo judge lives in isolation. Therefore, I am conscious of public opinion polls, various petitions, newspaper articles, discussions, proclamations of politicians and lawyers, and public assemblies\u2026 Judges in democracies cannot win public trust by seeking publicity and following public moods.

Wade. For this analysis, we surveyed 6,174 U.S. adults between June 27 and July 4, 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses.

The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology. A majority of Americans disapprove of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s landmark ruling overturning the Roe v.

Public support for legal abortion remains largely unchanged since before the decision, with 62% saying it should be legal in all or most cases. Nearly six-in-ten adults (57%) disapprove of the court\u2019s sweeping decision, including 43% who strongly disapprove. About four-in-ten (41%) approve of the court\u2019s decision (25% strongly approve).

Two travesties persist in tainting access by all to the U.S. legal system. One is the gaping lack of access to justice. The Legal Services Corporation estimates that 92% of the civil legal problems of the roughly 50 million low-income Americans receive no or insufficient legal help. Reasonable minds can quibble over that number \u2013 some say it is exaggerated \u2013 but no one doubts or disputes that the legal system falls dramatically short of serving those who need it, not just for those with low incomes, but also for the middle class and small businesses. The other is the continuing lack of public access to the law. For both primary and secondary legal materials, many remain under the commercial lock and key of major publishers, or under dubious claims of copyright by government entities, or so disparately and poorly organized as to be effectively inaccessible. As to both these travesties, there are many individuals, groups and organizations working hard to resolve them. For the most part, however, it seems that they work along separate tracks, pursuing parallel missions but employing separate strategies. Yet the fact is that these two travesties \u2013 and their hoped-for resolutions \u2013 are inextricably intertwined. We can never fully resolve the access to justice crisis unless we also resolve the lack of free and open access to the law. For many with legal problems, simply knowing the law and their rights is the first step toward achieving a resolution. What this means, perhaps, is that there should be greater coordination and collaboration between those working to close the justice gap and those working to free the law. On both fronts, these are major fights, but in unity, as they say, there is strength. Separate Summits Once again, the fodder for these ruminations came from two parallel conferences.

Most court web sites will post opinions and make them available for download on the same day they are issued. On the other hand, some courts remove older opinions from sites rather than maintain an archive. The federal courts, for example, remove some older opinions and place them on PACER, which requires a subscription and incurs access charges for documents other than opinions. Legislative documents are not always posted with the same speed, particularly transcripts or proceedings, but usually appear on an official site before a paper version becomes available, if one becomes available at all. Agency reports or documents that are created in the course of agency business usually appear on an agency\u2019s site around the same time as their public release. Another advantage is the broad range of documents that are available. Obscure documents include policy statements, forms, studies, reports, and smaller information collections. Law libraries do not necessarily carry these documents in print within their collections. They rely on the Internet as the major source of access for these materials. A rule of thumb is that irregularly issued documents from any official source are more likely to appear on the Internet than Lexis or Westlaw. A disadvantage is that the format of a document taken from the Internet may be difficult to cite. That has to do with how courts accept authentication of a document. The current standard is to recognize print collections as the official source of cases when both a print and online version exists. The only jurisdictions to abandon official printed reporters for case law entirely are Arkansas and Illinois. Beginning with opinion issued in 2009, the official source for Arkansas case law is the Arkansas court web site, though opinions will still be published by West in the Southwestern Reporter.

It is not therefore about free access to law generally, but rather about a particular group of its providers who collaborate.

This article updates a 2008 archival version, and where appropriate includes links to parts of that version that need not be repeated here. 1. Prior to Free Access to Legal Information Since the mid-1990s the Internet\u2019s World-Wide-Web has provided the necessary technical platform to enable free access to computerised legal information. Prior to the web there were many online legal information systems, and numerous legal information products distributed on CD-ROM, but there was no significant provision of free access to legal information anywhere in the world. Both government and private sector online legal publishers charged for access. The web provided the key element required for free public access \u2013 a low cost distribution mechanism. For publishers it was close to a \u201cno cost\u201d distribution mechanism if they were not required to pay for outgoing bandwidth. The ease of use of graphical browsers from around 1994, and the web\u2019s use of hypertext as its principal access mechanism (at that time) meant that the web provided a simple and relatively consistent means by which legal information could be both provided and accessed, an ",

History Lesson\r The idea that criminal court proceedings are accessible by the public is a pillar of our justice system, rooted in the First Amendment. This public right to unrestricted access in criminal and civil court proceedings has been interpreted by many states to extend to court documents and court records (as long as not otherwise protected). Traditionally, public access to court proceedings and records has been limited to those taking place in the courthouse, between the hours of 8:00 am and 4:00 pm. In most every other aspect of our lives, we have 24/7 access to everything from live streaming of our home security systems, to ordering our groceries or dinner from our mobile devices \u2014 while traveling\u00a0at 30,000 feet! Government \u2014 and courts in particular \u2014 has been slow to follow in the rush to 24/7 electronic accessibility. Part of the rationale behind the hesitation to jump on the electronic bandwagon, are the ethical issues surrounding unlimited electronic public access. So while the First Amendment provides for public access to information, conversely the Fourteenth Amendment interprets the definition of \u201cliberty\u201d to include a right to privacy. Deciding between these two semmingly contradictory rights becomes a challenge for courts when determining what form of electronic access is appropriate for court documents. The pros\r Unlimited electronic access to publicly available documents: The cons\r While there are compelling reasons to provide electronic public access, they don\u2019t take into account the potential for it to be used inappropriately. Risks include: What can states do?\r Allowing unlimited remote electronic access to court documents could compromise the privacy rights and concerns of individuals and increase the risk of harm to those par",

                  "raw_content": "How Social Media Impacts Criminal Cases The hearsay rule, which generally prohibits the use of out-of-court statements to prove the truth of the matter asserted, has specific exceptions that sometimes apply to social media content. Navigating these legal standards is a complex task that requires a keen understanding of both the law and the technical aspects of social media. Challenges of Authenticating Social Media Posts Lawyers often encounter significant hurdles when attempting to authenticate social media content. The ephemeral nature of digital data, coupled with the ease of creating fake accounts and manipulating screenshots, makes it challenging to prove that a social media post is genuine. Legal practitioners must be adept at tracing digital footprints, understanding metadata, and employing forensic techniques to establish the provenance of social media evidence. Impact on Jury Selection and Bias The rise of social media has transformed the process of jury selection. Attorneys now have the ability to conduct extensive online research on potential jurors, gleaning insights into their backgrounds, beliefs, and biases. This practice, while potentially useful for ensuring a fair trial, raises ethical questions about privacy and the extent to which personal online activity should be scrutinized. The American Bar Association provides guidelines on the ethical use of social media in juror research, emphasizing the importance of not crossing the line into communication with jurors. Legal professionals must navigate these ethical considerations carefully to maintain the integrity of the jury selection process. The Impact on Legal Outcomes Social media can have a profound impact on legal outcomes, influencing case strategies, plea bargains, and even trial verdicts. Attorneys must consider the digital evidence available on social media and how it may affect the direction of a case. For instance, incriminating evidence from a defendant's social media profile could lead to a stronger case for the prosecution and a high",

St. Eve Michael A. Zuckerman Abstract The explosive growth of social networking has placed enormous pressure on one of the most fundamental of American institutions\u2014the impartial jury. Through social networking services like Facebook and Twitter, jurors have committed significant and often high-profile acts of misconduct. Just recently, the Arkansas Supreme Court reversed a death sentence because a juror Tweeted about the case during deliberations. In light of the significant risks to a fair trial that arise when jurors communicate through social media during trial, judges must be vigilant in monitoring for potential outside influences and in deterring misconduct. In this Article, we present informal survey data from actual jurors on their use of social networking during trial. We discuss the rise of web-based social networks like Facebook and Twitter, and the concerns that arise when jurors communicate about a case through social media before returning a verdict. After surveying how courts have responded to jurors\u2019 social media use, we describe the results of the informal survey. The results support a growing consensus in the legal profession that courts should frequently, as a matter of course, instruct jurors not to use social media to communicate about trial. Although others have stressed the importance of jury instructions in this area, we hope that the informal survey data will further the dialogue by providing an important perspective\u2014that of actual jurors.

Human interaction and socializing were completely transformed in the early 2000s when social media platforms began to gain popularity. In 2005, only 5% of the US adult population used social media; 15 years later, that number is now around 80%. (1) Social media has gone from being a commodity to somewhat essential in multiple facets of American life. Most people use Facebook as a reminder of relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 birthdays, use Twitter to stay up to date on their sports teams, and even LinkedIn has become essential in getting a job or even getting into graduate school. Social media platforms have found their way into nearly every aspect of our lives.\u00a0 These platforms have caused Americans to be quite transparent with complete strangers. Some Americans do not keep their social media accounts private.\u00a0 On the contrary, many seem to enjoy spreading news and information about their lives, their interests, likes/dislikes, values and beliefs via posts and tweets. Before social media, most people did not voice their opinions for the world to see, they were kept private and generally, only those close to them would know this information. Some trial attorneys would go so far to hire investigators to follow some jurors in order to get information and insight into their lives to determine whether or not they would be good jurors for their case.(2)\u00a0 Before social media, when someone openly voiced their opinion or forced their beliefs or values upon someone it provided a plethora of information about those individuals. For example, if someone picketed an abortion clinic every single weekend, one could likely deduce that the individual was religious, likely conservative, likely votes Republican with strong beliefs against abortion. However, in contemporary times on social media, these opinions are not as robust or accurate. There may be a person who retweets a tweet from President Donald Trump on voter fraud. What does this mean? Does it mean they are pro-Trump? Does it ",

Abstract In 2015, we provided an overview of the use of digital technologies in clinical trials, both as a methodological tool and as a mechanism to deliver interventions. At that time, there was limited guidance and limited use of digital technologies in clinical research. However, since then smartphones have become ubiquitous and digital health technologies have exploded. This paper provides an update to our earlier publication and an overview of how technology has been used in the past five years in clinical trials, providing examples with varying levels of technological integration and across different health conditions. Digital technology integration ranges from the incorporation of artificial intelligence in diagnostic devices to the use of real-world data (e.g., electronic health records) for study recruitment. Clinical trials can now be conducted entirely virtually, eliminating the need for in-person interaction.

Abstract Background Use of the Internet to conduct randomised controlled trials is increasing, and provides potential to increase equity of access to medical research, increase the generalisability of trial results and decrease the costs involved in conducting large scale trials. Several studies have compared response rates, completeness of data, and reliability of surveys using the Internet and traditional methods, but very little is known about participants\u2019 attitudes towards Internet-based randomised trials or their experience of participating in an Internet-based trial. Objective To obtain insights into the experiences and perspectives of participants in an Internet-based randomised controlled trial, their attitudes to the use of the Internet to conduct medical research, and their intentions regarding future participation in Internet research. Methods All English speaking participants in a recently completed Internet randomised controlled trial were invited to participate in an online survey. Results 1246 invitations were emailed. 416 participants completed the survey between May and October 2009 (33% response rate). Reasons given for particip",

This study explores the influence of mass media on public perceptions of criminal cases through a qualitative approach, utilizing in-depth interviews and media content analysis. It investigates how media framing and narratives shape public opinion, as well as the role of the media in shaping legal awareness and social justice. The study reveals that media framing often leads to bias and stereotyping, impacting public views of perpetrators and victims. Moreover, consumption of news without verification can increase fear and anxiety in communities. Media practitioners and law enforcement professionals feel pressure to produce sensationalized news, compromising accuracy and balance. Despite the potential of mass media to enhance legal literacy, its effectiveness depends on ethical news coverage and media literacy education. Collaboration between media and law enforcement is crucial to ensure information dissemination does not disrupt the judicial process. In conclusion, responsible media coverage is essential for fostering a fair and transparent judicial system, and this study offers insights for improving media practices and promoting justice in society.

The news media are not mirrors, simply reflecting events in society. Rather, media content is shaped by economic and marketing considerations that frequently override traditional journalistic criteria for newsworthiness. This Article explores local and national television's treatment of crime, where the extent and style of news stories about crime are being adjusted to meet perceived viewer demand and advertising strategies, which frequently emphasize particular demographic groups with a taste for violence. Newspapers also reflect a market-driven reshaping of style and content, resulting in a continuing emphasis on crime stories as a cost-effective means to grab readers' attention. This has all occurred despite more than a decade of sharply falling crime rates. The Article also explores the accumulating social science evidence that the market-driven treatment of crime in the news media has the potential to skew American public opinion, increasing the support for various punitive policies such as mandatory minimums, longer sentences, and treating juveniles as adults. Through agenda setting and priming, media emphasis increases public concern about crime and makes it a more important criteria in assessing political leaders. Then, once the issue has been highlighted, the media's emphasis increases support for punitive policies, though the mechanisms through which this occurs are less well understood. This Article explores the evidence for the mechanisms of framing, increasing fear of crime, and instilling and reinforcing racial stereotypes and l",

Kania began examining prime-time TV and print media descriptions of criminal justice topics in the mid-1980s. The researchers concluded that the media portrayals of the justice system had changed over the century (1890-1990). They also drew the conclusion that the mass media serves as gatekeepers for coverage on the corrections process through the news as well as prime-time TV shows, which blur the line of fiction and reality. They also noted that the news media and entertainment media reinforce each other to promote the idea that crime is immediate and a public threat. The authors concluded that if justice scholars and other professionals do not take an active role in framing criminal justice stories in the media, then news and entertainment producers by default with determine the perception of this industry.

Public opinion and judicial decisions should be mutually independent, but the intervention of public opinion does not necessarily affect judicial independence. Instead, public opinion plays a role in supervising the fairness of judicial decisions. Coor dinating the relationship between public opinion and judicial decisions is a long -term task that needs to be continuously improved in the process of promoting the comprehensive rule of law. Introduction In modern society, judicial decision-making is not only a legal issue, but also a social issue. It concerns the realization of justice, the maintenance of morality, and the stability of social order. The fairness and authority of judicial decisions often directly reflect the level of a country's rule of law. However, judicial decision-making is not isolated from society, but closely linked to social development. Especially in a democratic society, public opinion, as a collective expression of the public's pursuit of justice, has a profound impact on the formation and implementation of judicial decisions. Studying the relationship between judicial decision-making and public opinion is of great significance to the development of China's rule of law.

For decades, published articles have consistently reported a significant, positive relationship between public opinion and Supreme Court output. However, these studies posit mutually contradictory theories and report irreconcilable results. We advance this literature in two ways. First, we show the empirical \"fact\" driving the search for a workable theory is actually illusory. Second, we defend a theory of judicial independence. To be clear, we do not attempt to prove the Court does not respond to the public's opinions on policy. We argue that there is little reason the Court should respond and demonstrate that, contrary to twenty-five years of scholarship, there is no good empirical evidence suggesting it does.

However, the extent to which public sentiment impacts judicial outcomes remains a subject of intense debate among legal scholars, policymakers, and the general public. This essay describes various dimensions of this relationship, examining both theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence to understand how public opinion influences judicial decisions. Understanding judicial independence and impartiality Central to the judicial process is the concept of judicial independence, which safeguards judges' ability to interpret laws free from external pressures, including public sentiment. Independence reinforces the judiciary's role in upholding the rule of law and ensuring fair and just outcomes. Similarly, judicial impartiality requires judges to decide cases based solely on legal principles and facts presented in court, without bias or external influence. Theoretical perspectives on public opinion and judicial decisions Legal realism and sociological jurisprudence: Legal realists argue that judges are not immune to societal values and public sentiment, influencing their interpretation and application of laws. Sociological jurisprudence posits that judges, consciously or unconsciously, reflect prevailing social norms and public attitudes in their decisions. Attitudinal model: This model suggests that judges' ideological orientations and personal beliefs shape their decisions, which may align with or diverge from public opinion. Judges with conservative or liberal leanings may interpret laws differently based on their ideological predispositions. Counterarguments for judicial independence: Critics of the public opinion influence argue that judicial decisions should be insulated from transient public sentiments to uphold impartiality and f",

According to Statista , it was found that, as of September 2017, the typical American spent an average of 721 minutes per day consuming media. Of this number, U.S. adults spent an average of 123 minutes on laptop or desktop activities, while the daily reach of television was estimated to be roughly 75 percent of the population. Given this huge amount of interaction with media combined with the reach of television, major news stories, like those of high-profile trials, influence public opinion and, in certain cases, potentially even the jury itself. Here are a few examples of such trials where media may have played a role in the outcome. Traditional Media - The Aileen Wuornos Case Aileen Wuornos, branded as America's first female serial killer by the media (a label used as the defining theme of her trial coverage), is a prime example of media coverage and influence. Media coverage of her crimes helped sway the public against her, painting her in the image of a 'man-hating murderer' before the case was closed. Although her story around the murders changed frequently, she held constant her belief that the media had created a bias against her. Prior to her initial trial, she requested a change of venue due to the publicity already surrounding her case. This was denied. After the initial trial, she claimed that the media coverage was out to get her, leading to her being found guilty. In some ways, it was not the media itself but the drive by various individuals surrounding the case to gain publicity and money that may have affected the outcome of Aileen Wuornos' trials.

In today's digital age, social media plays a significant role in various aspects of society, including the legal realm. Social media's impact on criminal cases is profound, affecting everything from the investigation process to the trial and public perception. Understanding these impacts can be crucial for those involved in the criminal justice system, whether they are defendants, lawyers, or law enforcement officers. 1. Social Media as Evidence One of the most significant ways social media impacts criminal cases is through using posts, messages, and other online activities as evidence. Law enforcement agencies often monitor social media platforms for information related to criminal activities.

Newspapers, radio, television, and new media not only spread information, but also help to determine what topics and stories people talk about. Many crimes receive extensive media coverage, which provides a challenge for prosecutors, as well as defendants and defense attorneys, when it comes to trying a case. Juries are supposed to be unbiased when deciding a case, despite the news coverage they may have come across before trial. Police officers involved in criminal cases may become entangled with the media in the process of providing information about a case.

The trial of Gerard Baden-Clay captivated the nation. Every day, hundreds of people queued up to get into the Public Gallery of the Supreme Court in Brisbane, and the trial was given blanket coverage by the major TV networks. Associate Professor Anderson discusses how the prevalence of social media and the internet has made enforcing fair trials increasingly difficult and points out the emergence of the \"Googling juror\". Media coverage has even been used as grounds for arguing the fairness of trials or mitigating factors in sentencing by defence council. Changes in the way media is consumed have reduced confidence that jurors are separating themselves from the media or public opinion of cases. Listen to the interview in its entirety here.

This study aims to explore the delayed and combinatory responses of online public opinion to the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: (a) Is there a temporal delay in the response of online public opinion to the intensity of the pandemic? (b) Does this delay exhibit general characteristics of social networks, such as combinatory effects and higher-order interactions? To address these questions, we employ natural language processing techniques to extract online public opinion data and utilize statistical and machine learning-based causal inference methods for analysis. The findings indicate that online public opinion\u2019s response to the intensity of COVID-19 is not immediate but rather exhibits a long-term lag. Identical COVID-19 intensity data can trigger multiple delayed public opinion responses, while a single delayed public opinion datum may be influenced by multiple preceding COVID-19 intensity data points. This delayed response of online public opinion and its higher-order network characteristics result in a waveform structure of real-world impacts influenced by online public opinion. We also utilized machine learning causal inference techniques to investigate the sensitivity differ",

Internet public opinion not only reflects hot issues of social concern and public sentiment, but also affects social stability and national security. Therefore, strengthening the rule of law governance of online public opinion has become an urgent problem. The purpose of this study is to explore the rule of law basis and major problems of online public opinion governance in the era of big data, to analyses the shortcomings of the current implementation of the rule of law in online public opinion, and to propose corresponding countermeasures. In the context of the big data era, the rule of law in online public opinion governance faces challenges in many aspects. Inadequate supervision, imperfect rule of law system, deficiencies in the implementation mechanism, and weak public awareness of the rule of law together constitute the main problems in the current governance of online public opinion. To effectively deal with these problems, it is necessary to start with strengthening supervision, improving the rule of law system, reinforcing the implementation mechanism and raising awareness of the rule of law. Through these measures, a more mature and effective rule of law system for the governance of online public opinion can be constructed, thereby",

Questions regarding what constitutes a respectable response rate for online surveys in research remained unanswered. To fill in the knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive search, screened 8672 studies, and examined 1071 online survey response rates reported in education-related research. Our analyses showed the number of online surveys in published research grew steadily across the years. The average online survey response rate is 44.1%. Our results indicate that sending an online survey to more participants did not generate a higher response rate. Instead, sending surveys to a clearly defined and refined population positively impacts the online survey response rate. In addition, pre-contacting potential participants, using other types of surveys in conjunction with online surveys, and using phone calls to remind participants about the online survey could also yield a higher response rate. The use of incentives did not show a significant impact on the response rate of online surveys. Other factors that impacted the rates included the funding status of a project, and the age and occupation of the participants.

Thus, a more practical approach is urgently needed to deal with this dynamic and complicated phenomenon of propagating public opinion. This paper proposes that the outbreak of internet public opinion and its negative impacts, such as the occurrence of major security incidents, are a result of coupling and the complex interaction of many factors. The Functional Resonance Analysis Method model is composed of those factors and considers the stages of network information dissemination, the unique propagation rule, and textual sentiment resonance on the internet. Moreover, it is the first public opinion governance method that simultaneously highlights the complex system, functional identification, and functional resonance. It suggests a more effective method to shorten the dissipation time of negative public opinion and is a considerable improvement over previous models for risk-prediction. Based on resonance theory and deep learning, this study establishes public opinion resonance functions, which made it possible to analyze public opinion triggers and build a simulation",

Abstract In the period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), millions of people participate in the discussion of COVID-19 on the Internet, which can easily trigger public opinion and threaten social stability. This paper creatively proposes a multi-stage risk grading model of Internet public opinion for public health emergencies. On the basis of general public opinion risk grading analysis, the model continuously pays attention to the risk level of Internet public opinion based on the time scale of regular or major information updates.

If the government fails to implement emergency measures quickly, the risks associated with this online public opinion may escalate and present significant challenges in managing it. To solve this issue, this paper investigates the M5.7 earthquake in Yibin, China, as a case study, drawing data from China\u2019s Sina Weibo. It also develops an evolutionary model of earthquake online public opinion using the life cycle theory of public opinion dissemination, public opinion crisis management theory, and system dynamics methods. This study chooses a system dynamic model because it can capture overall trends and feedback cycles. This approach provides a comprehensive view of the evolution of the whole system\u2019s behavior and public opinion during the crisis. This model analyzes the evolution of the online public opinion of the earthquake from the perspective of the earthquake, netizens (social media users), media, and government. This study explores the differences between online public opinion by adjusting the size of different variables in the model. This provides an entry point for better control of the development and communication of earthquake online public opinion. The findings indicate that, following the earthquake, the media exerted the most significant influence on public opinion, mainly through media participation, diffusion, and impact, demonstrating a signi",

It is argued that a preference for user-generated content may result in different perceptions of the opinion climate than a preference for mass media. This may also affect willingness to speak out in public. This study tested the effects of selective exposure to information regarding climate change in Germany. The individual media diets were derived from online diaries and content analyses. The findings show no support for the spiral of silence theory. Individuals who see themselves in the minority were even more likely to express their opinions.

The forming process and evolutionary dynamics of public opinions online have been heavily investigated. Using agent-based modeling, we expand the Ising model to explore how individuals behave and the evolutionary mechanism of the life cycles. The big data platform of Douban.com is selected as the data source, and the online case \u201cNeiYuanWaiFang\u201d is applied as the real target, for our modeling and simulations to match. We run 10,000 simulations to find possible optimal solutions, and we run 10,000 times again to check the robustness and adaptability. The optimal solution simulations can reflect the whole life cycle process. In terms of different levels and indicators, the fitting or matching degrees achieve the highest levels. At the micro-level, the distributions of individual behaviors under real case and simulations are similar to each other, and they all follow normal distributions; at the middle-level, both discrete and continuous distributions of supportive and oppositive online comments are matched between real case and simulations; at the macro-level, the life cycle process (outbreak, rising, peak, and vanish) and durations can be well matc",

The popularization and application of the Internet has brought great convenience to the people, promoted the communication and interaction between the government and the people, and added new ways of expressing public opinion; the Internet is highly developed, and the government makes full use of its role to collect social opinions through Internet. Public opinion promotes the democratization and scientific rationality of public policies. This article will discuss the following aspects: first, focus on the influence of online public opinion on public policy, explain the research background of the article, analyze and organize it; second, consult relevant literature, sort out the related concepts of online public opinion and public policy and characteristics; third, analyze the value of online public opinion on public policies, including positive and negative effects, based on cases, data, and referenced literature; finally, put forward targeted suggestions and countermeasures for existing problems, including improvement. The government plays an important role in the construction of network infrastructure and strengthening the moral education of netizens. It is necessary to do a good job in guiding the network public opinion, devote itself to creating a good and healthy network atmosphere, and attach importance to the dual influence of network public opinion on public policies, to make it fully play its positive role.

The analysis suggests that online public opinion represents a unique population as opposed to offline surveys. The study model examines Korean texts generated by online users and automatically predicts their sentiments, which translate into group attitudes by aggregation. The research method can extend to other studies, including those on environmental and cultural issues, which have greater online presence. This provides opportunities to examine the influences of social phenomenon, benefiting individuals seeking to understand people in an online context. Moreover, it helps scholars in analyzin",

Internet public opinion not only reflects hot issues of social concern and public sentiment, but also affects social stability and national security. Therefore, strengthening the rule of law governance of online public opinion has become an urgent problem. The purpose of this study is to explore the rule of law basis and major problems of online public opinion governance in the era of big data, to analyses the shortcomings of the current implementation of the rule of law in online public opinion, and to propose corresponding countermeasures. In the context of the big data era, the rule of law in online public opinion governance faces challenges in many aspects. Inadequate supervision, imperfect rule of law system, deficiencies in the implementation mechanism, and weak public awareness of the rule of law together constitute the main problems in the current governance of online public opinion. To effectively deal with these problems, it is necessary to start with strengthening supervision, improving the rule of law system, reinforcing the implementation mechanism and raising awareness of the rule of law. Through these measures, a more mature and effective rule of law system for the governance of online public opinion can be constructed, thereby",

Abstract Background: During the outbreak of COVID-19, online public opinion related to the epidemic was rapidly generated and developed rapidly. If some online public opinions cannot be effectively responded to and guided, it will bring risks to social order. The government should understand how to use information on social media to grasp public demands, provide useful information in a timely manner and take countermeasures. Studying the formation mechanism of online public opinion during the outbreak can help the government make scientific decisions and improve risk management capabilities. Methods: The research selects the public opinion information of online platforms represented by WeChat, online communities, Sina Weibo and search engines, involving 75 relevant texts (1 January to 31 March 2022). According to the grounded theory method, using the QSR NVivo12 qualitative research software, the collected network texts were successively researched using open coding, axial coding and theoretical coding.

To solve this issue, this paper investigates the M5.7 earthquake in Yibin, China, as a case study, drawing data from China\u2019s Sina Weibo. It also develops an evolutionary model of earthquake online public opinion using the life cycle theory of public opinion dissemination, public opinion crisis management theory, and system dynamics methods.

The current paper explores whether online shaming is motivated by a person's desire to do good (a justice motive); and/or, because it feels good (a hedonic motive), specifically, as a form of pleasure at witnessing another's misfortune (schadenfreude). We examine two key aspects of social media that may moderate these processes: anonymity (Study 1) and social norms (the responses of other users; Studies 2\u20133).

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes.

Abstract A public shaming frenzy has spread through social media (SM) following the instigation of lockdown policies as a way to counter the spread of COVID-19. On SM, individuals shun the idea of self-promotion and shame others who do not follow the COVID-19 guidelines. When it comes to the crime of not taking a pandemic seriously, perhaps the ultimate penalty is online shaming. The study proposes the black swan theory from the human-computer interaction lens and examines the toxic combination of online shaming and self-promotion in SM to discern whether pointing the finger of blame is a productive way of changing r",

At its core, cancel culture represents a form of social ostracism where individuals or groups are thrust out of social or professional circles \u2013 either online, in the real world, or both. It\u2019s a phenomenon that has been accelerated by social media, leading to rapid and widespread public judgments and reactions. As this practice becomes more prevalent, it\u2019s imperative to understand its social implications and its profound impact on mental health. Societal Implications of Cancel Culture The Rise of Cancel Culture: Social, Cultural, and Technological Factors Cancel culture has gained significant prominence in modern society, propelled by social, cultural, and technological factors. Socially and culturally, there\u2019s growing awareness and sensitivity toward social justice, equality, and personal conduct issues. This heightened awareness, while fostering positive change, has also led to increased scrutiny of individuals\u2019 actions and words, sometimes resulting in rapid negative public judgments. Technologically, the advent of social media has played a pivotal role. Platforms like X (formerly known as Twitter), Facebook, and Instagram offer a global stage for discussion, activism, and, unfortunately, public shaming. These plat",

Branden Collinsworth \u00b7Follow 2 min read \u00b7 Feb 15, 2023 -- Listen Share Cancel culture. It\u2019s a term that has been on everyone\u2019s lips lately, and it isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. In fact, it seems to be becoming more pervasive in our society. But what exactly is cancel culture? Why is it the lowest form of humanity? And how can we move away from it? At its core, cancel culture is the idea of publicly shaming someone for their beliefs or actions \u2014 usually by making threats of boycotts or other forms of retribution against them if they don\u2019t comply with a certain opinion or ideology. This often leads to people being subjected to unfair criticism and ostracization from wider society. It can also lead to people feeling disempowered and unable to express themselves freely, as the fear of being \u2018cancelled\u2019 looms over any interaction. In essence, cancel culture is an attempt to control speech and thought through fear, bullying and intimidation. This makes it particularly damaging as it denies individuals their right to voice their opinions without fear of repercussion. It stifles creativity and expression while exacerbating existing power dynamics between those who have a platform and those who don\u2019t have one yet. The effects of cancel culture are wide-reaching; not only does it limit freedom of speech, but it also affects mental health in diverse ways \u2014 from feelings of anxiety and depression due to public backlash and ostracization, to reduced self-esteem due to regularly being judged by others on social media platforms such as Twitter or Instagram. Moreover, cancelling people instead of engaging with them in meaningful dialogue prevents us from engaging with different perspectives which could potentially offer valuable insights into our own views \u2014 a crucial part of growing both as individuals as well as societies at large. Similarly, cancelling an individual ",

We must be allowed to debate controversial topics if we are to evolve and improve. Clearly the topic upset some people. That was not my intent, but even I struggle to find the right language to avoid offending everyone, a thankless task this post addresses. The topic was an individual\u2019s choice about whether to use webcams in this new online and hybrid world of working from home or remotely. Certain remote workers seem to be refusing to turn on their webcams in meetings and other group sessions they are attending. They cite various and often nebulous reasons. In the post I raised the topic of someone citing a need not to be on camera which may have just been used as an excuse to avoid compliance. It also highlighted the culture of fear in society that\u00a0 has emerged from the so named \u201cCancel Culture\u201d. This has led to real fears being expressed by colleagues in the industry that they may be fired, or worse, if they say something that inadvertently \u201coffends\u201d someone. I linked this to the topic of \u201cpsychological safety\u201d and how this culture of \u201cbeing offended\u201d is limiting or preventing psychological safety. What the post revealed, based on the feedback and further research, is we have changed the \u201cwhere\u201d we work, and the \u201chow\u2019\u201d we work, but we have failed to change the \u201cwhat\u201d we do and the \u201cwhy\u201d we do it. Examples: The company culture (the product of collective behaviors) needs to be addressed. You changed your operating model but you didn\u2019t change your behaviors, or your expectations. You demand the same way of working as the in person model, but the environmental variables have changed significantly. Questions: Then there\u2019s the issue of anxiety by feeling you\u2019re being spotlighted. It seems seeing your self view is off putting to some. People can actually turn off their self view.

Only when we discover what is wrong with them do we feel we have grasped the problem. Clearly they are the problem, and changing or getting rid of them (or simply being angry at them) is the solution. There\u2019s a problem with this common scenario, however: Where there is blame, there is no learning. Where there is blame, open minds close, inquiry tends to cease, and the desire to understand the whole system diminishes.

Introduction Personal growth and transformation are fundamental aspects of human development, as individuals strive to become the best versions of themselves. It is a continuous journey of self-improvement, encompassing various areas such as emotional well-being, intellectual growth, and the acquisition of new skills. Along this transformative path, accountability plays a crucial role in driving progress and ensuring sustainable change. Accountability, in the context of personal development, refers to taking responsibility for one\u2019s actions, choices, and outcomes. It involves holding oneself answerable to the goals, values, and commitments set forth on the journey of personal growth. By embracing accountability, individuals empower themselves to make intentional decisions, track their progress, and make necessary adjustments along the way. II. Understanding Accountability Photo by Steven Erixon on Unsplash A. Definition of Accountability Accountability can be defined as the willingness to accept ownership of one\u2019s thoughts, actions, and results. It involves being answerable to oneself and others for the choices made and the consequences they bring. In personal development, accountability acts as a guiding principle, providing a framework for self-reflection, evaluation, and growth. B.

Lozano Less than a year ago, the prospect of widespread online trials seemed eons away. However, after nine months of a pandemic-induced global shutdown, it seems that the sci-fi scenario of online courtrooms has become today\u2019s brave new reality: Many countries have moved courtrooms online to avoid fully abridging access to justice during the pandemic. After the first Zoom-only criminal jury trial was held on August 11, 2020 in Texas, some were left disillusioned. The attorneys involved in the case argued that the technology was not suited for anything more serious than a minor misdemeanor, listing a number of concerns about technological glitches impacting communication and confidentiality for the jurors. In particular, the attorneys pointed out that the jury panel wasn't representative of the demographics of Travis County, Texas because of who had access to the necessary technology. They also stated that jurors had a limited ability to properly use Zoom, which was exacerbated by connectivity issues and freezing screens. For example, one juror was excused due to a connectivity issue during the oath. Others, however, think these issues are resolvable and argue that attorney mindset is a bigger hurdle for online trials than the technology itself. \r The Online Courtroom Project released a report in July 2020 that summarized its findings after studying the benefits and limitations of conducting a jury trial entirely online. The Project culminated in a demonstration jury trial, which forms the basis for the report\u2019s findings.

The spread of online public opinion in emergencies is characteriz ed by high outbreaks, high attention, complex and uncontrollable information, which to a certain extent affects the government's guidance and governance of online public opinion. In the process of managing online public opinion on emergencies, the governme nt is faced with various difficulties such as delayed and passive responses, low participation of social governance subjects, and delayed and imperfect legislation. Only by establishing a comprehensive system of government -society online public opinion mon itoring, improving the government's online public opinion response and disposal mechanism, scientifically monitoring information sources and improving data network dynamic monitoring technology, and improving the construction of the rule of law for governm ent online public opinion governance, can the government improve its ability to govern and guide online public opinion during emergencies.

Internet public opinion not only reflects hot issues of social concern and public sentiment, but also affects social stability and national security. Therefore, strengthening the rule of law governance of online public opinion has become an urgent problem. The purpose of this study is to explore the rule of law basis and major problems of online public opinion governance in the era of big data, to analyses the shortcomings of the current implementation of the rule of law in online public opinion, and to propose corresponding countermeasures. In the context of the big data era, the rule of law in online public opinion governance faces challenges in many aspects. Inadequate supervision, imperfect rule of law system, deficiencies in the implementation mechanism, and weak public awareness of the rule of law together constitute the main problems in the current governance of online public opinion. To effectively deal with these problems, it is necessary to start with strengthening supervision, improving the rule of law system, reinforcing the implementation mechanism and raising awareness of the rule of law. Through these measures, a more mature and effective rule of law system for the governance of online public opinion can be constructed, thereby",

Abstract Online shaming, where individuals participate in social policing by shaming supposed wrongdoings on the internet, is a rapidly increasing and global phenomenon. The potential impacts of online shaming are said to be extensive and wide-reaching, however minimal empirical research on this topic has been conducted to date, with existing coverage being largely anecdotal and media-based. The current study aims to demonstrate how online shaming is constructed in contemporary online news media. Qualitative analysis using Giles and Shaw\u2019s (2009) media framing analysis was completed on 69 online news articles published within the last two years concerning online shaming. Two overarching representations of online shaming were uncovered: a dominant narrative framing online shaming as a dangerous threat with serious consequences, and a smaller frame representing online shaming as more constructive and capable of resulting in positive outcomes. Variations in conditions presented,",

In recent years, the rise of Facebook and Twitter, and the potential for public shaming on the internet, motivated Lewinsky to speak up. \u201cA marketplace has emerged where public humiliation is a commodity, and shame is an industry,\u201d she says in the video. One can only speculate whether Lewinsky would have been met with criticism or empathy on today\u2019s digital stage. In some cases, this internet-based outrage culture results in positive change. It has exposed grave offenses, elevated political movements and toppled abusers in the U.S. and beyond.

In those times, online reputation management (ORM) was unheard of, and social media networking was yet to be part of the virtual landscape. The survival rate of being digitally shamed in the early days of the Internet were very slim. \u00a0 I was one of the lucky ones\u00a0 \u00a0 Being able to hire an attorney, sue for Internet defamation and invasion of privacy, in 2006 I won a landmark case in Florida when a jury awarded me $11.3M verdict for the damages that were done to\u00a0my organization\u00a0and myself online. \u00a0 By 2006 when I won my case, I was both financially and emotionally crippled. What should h \u00a0 ave been a celebration was short-lived when I realized that although Lady Justice cleared my name, the Internet never forgives or forgets. \u00a0 Fortunately for me, the first reputation management company opened their doors that summer and I was one of their first clients. I have and continue to say in all my speeches and writings, my attorney vindicated me, however it was ReputationDefender that gave me my life back. \u00a0 The old saying, you don\u2019t get a second chance to make a first impression is no longer related to a handshake or your in-person interview \u2014 it\u2019s your digital resume that people will usually judge you on before ever meeting you in person. \u00a0 CareerBuilders survey\u2019s every year has shown an increase of employers that are discarding potential applicants due to their social media content and behavior. Going offline is not the answer \u2013 since these same survey\u2019s also reveal that company\u2019s won\u2019t hire you if they can\u2019t find you online. \u00a0 The impact of online shaming \u00a0 From owning a busine",

People are more likely to share misinformation when it aligns with personal identity or social norms, when it is novel, and when it elicits strong emotions According to behavioral models, exposure to misinformation increases the odds that people will believe it, which in turn increases the odds that they will spread it. At the same time, people do not necessarily need to believe misinformation in order to spread it; people may share information they know is false to signal their political affiliation, disparage perceived opponents, or accrue social rewards. Psychological factors contribute significantly to this process: People are more likely to share misinformation when it aligns with personal identity or social norms, when it is novel, and when it elicits strong emotions.

It is vital for schools to provide students with a solid education on media and information literacy as part of the curriculum. Teachers must be well-trained in the subject to empower students with the necessary competences to critically understand and assess information reported by all forms of media. Projects in partnership with national and local authorities and media organisations are encouraged. Facts & figures Two thirds of EU citizens report coming across fake news at least once a week.[1] Over 80% of EU citizens say they see fake news both as an issue for their country and for democracy in general.[2] Half of EU citizens aged 15-30 say they need critical thinking and information skills to help them combat fake news and extremism in society.[3] What is propaganda, misinformation and fake news? The terms \u2018propaganda\u2019, \u2018misinformation\u2019 and \u2018fake news\u2019 often overlap in meaning. They are used to refer to a range of ways in which sharing information causes harm, intentionally or unintentionally \u2013 usually in relation to the promotion of a particular moral or political cause or point of view. It is possible to separate out three clearly different uses of information which fall into this category: Although none of these phenomena are new, they have taken on new significance recently with the widespread availability of sophisticated forms of information and communication technology. The sharing of text, images, videos, or links online, for example, allows information to go viral within hours. Why is propaganda, misinformation and fake news important at school?

A review of some recent public opinion research shows just how much. For example, an NPR survey conducted earlier this year found that 64% of the American population believes that U.S. democracy is in crisis and is at risk of failing. A strong indication that the situation is getting worse and not better is that over 70% of respondents in that poll said that democracy is more at risk of failure now than it was a year ago. Similarly, a Quinnipiac University survey reveals that 76% of respondents think political instability within the country is a bigger danger to the United States than external adversaries. Amazingly, this suggests that Americans recognize that we are a bigger threat to our own democracy than any other potential external threat. Sadly, according to this poll, over half of Americans (53%) expect political divisions in the country to worsen over their lifetime rather than get better. One of the drivers of decreased confidence in the political system has been the explosion of misinformation deliberately aimed at disrupting the democratic process. This confuses and overwhelms voters. Throughout the 2020 election cycle, Russia\u2019s cyber efforts and online actors were able to influence public perceptions and sought to amplify mistrust in the electoral process by denigrating mail-in voting, highlighting alleged irregularities, and accusing the Democratic Party of engaging in voter fraud. The \u201cbig lie\u201d reinforced by President Trump about the 2020 election results amplified the Russian efforts and has lasting implications on voters\u2019 trust in election outcomes. The Collaborative Multi-Racial Political Study reveals that a robust 57% of white Americans believes there was voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, including 26% of whom believe th",

By Steven Lee Myers It is well known that social media amplifies misinformation and other harmful content. The Integrity Institute, an advocacy group, is now trying to measure exactly how much \u2014 and on Thursday it began publishing results that it plans to update each week through the midterm elections on Nov. 8. The institute\u2019s initial report, posted online, found that a \u201cwell-crafted lie\u201d will get more engagements than typical, truthful content and that some features of social media sites and their algorithms contribute to the spread of misinformation. Twitter, the analysis showed, has what the institute called the great misinformation amplification factor, in large part because of its feature allowing people to share, or \u201cretweet,\u201d posts easily. It was followed by TikTok, the Chinese-owned video site, which uses machine-learning models to predict engagement and make recommendations to users. \u201cWe see a difference for each platform because each platform has different mechanisms for virality on it,\u201d said Jeff Allen, a former integrity officer at Facebook and a founder and the chief research officer at the Integrity Institute. \u201cThe more mechanisms there are for virality on the platform, the more we see misinformation getting additional distribution.\u201d The institute calculated its findings by comparing posts that members of the International Fact-Checking Network have identified as false with the engagement of previous posts that were not flagged from the same accounts. It analyzed nearly 600 fact-checked posts in September on a variety of subjects, including the Covid-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine and the upcoming elections. Facebook, according to the sample that the institute has studied so far, had the most instances of misinformation but amplified such claims to a lesser degree, in part because sharing posts requires more steps.

Yet, with this power, there\u2019s a hidden trap many of us unknowingly fall into that impacts our perspectives more than we realize: echo chambers \u2013 a concept that isn\u2019t new but has been magnified in the digital age.\u00a0\u00a0 Echo Chambers\u00a0 So, what exactly is an echo chamber? Think of it as a room where the only voices you hear are echoes of your own. On social media, it means being surrounded primarily by opinions and views similar to yours. Every time you like, share, or engage with content, you are unknowingly signaling to the social media platform\u2019s algorithm your preferences.\u00a0 Echo chambers aren\u2019t just a product of the digital age. Throughout history, people have naturally gravitated toward information that confirms their existing beliefs. In earlier times, newspapers, radio, and television played pivotal roles in this. People would often select newspapers that reflected their political views or tune into TV shows that mirrored their personal beliefs. While the technology has evolved, the intrinsic human desire for validation remains a constant. What\u2019s shifted is the speed, scale, and precision with which you\u2019re served these views. And how much easier it is to spread misinformation and disinformation rapidly in social media.\u00a0 How Algorithms Become Unsolicited Curators\u00a0 Social media platforms, in their quest to keep us engaged, show content they believe we\u2019ll find appealing, largely based on our past actions.

Abstract The viral spread of digital misinformation has become so severe that the World Economic Forum considers it among the main threats to human society. This spread have been suggested to be related to the similarly problematized phenomenon of \u201cecho chambers\u201d, but the causal nature of this relationship has proven difficult to disentangle due to the connected nature of social media, whose causality is characterized by complexity, non-linearity and emergence. This paper uses a network simulation model to study a possible relationship between echo chambers and the viral spread of misinformation. It finds an \u201cecho chamber effect\u201d: the presence of an opinion and network polarized cluster of nodes in a network contributes to the diffusion of complex contagions, and there is a synergetic effect between opinion and network polarization on the virality of misinformation. The echo chambers effect likely comes from that they form the initial bandwagon for diffusion. These findings have implication for the study of the media logic of new social media.

During the 2020 election\u00a0season, the team presented 879 participants with online surveys and showed them one of eight fake news headlines that covered topics from political scandals to candidate health concerns and implicated either Joe Biden or Donald Trump. The survey asked whether they would share the headline or share opposing information, as well as how it made them feel.

Prior work on the psychology of misinformation has focused primarily on the extent to which reason and deliberation hinder versus help the formation of accurate beliefs. Several studies have suggested that people who engage in more reasoning are less likely to fall for fake news. However, the role of reliance on emotion in belief in fake news remains unclear. To shed light on this issue, we explored the relationship between experiencing specific emotions and believing fake news (Study 1; N\u2009=\u2009409). We found that across a wide range of specific emotions, heightened emotionality at the outset of the study\u00a0was predictive of greater\u00a0belief in fake (but not real) news\u00a0posts. Then, in Study 2, we measured and manipulated reliance on emotion versus reason across four experiments (total N\u2009=\u20093884). We found both correlational and causal evidence that reliance on emotion increases belief in fake news: self-reported use of emotion was positively associated with belief in fake (but not real) news, and inducing reliance on emotion resulted in greater belief in fake (but not real) news stories compared to a control or to inducing reliance on reason. These results shed light on the unique role that emotional processing may play in susceptibility to fake news.

Those forecasting improvement place their hopes in technological fixes and in societal solutions. Others think the dark side of human nature is aided more than stifled by technology. In late 2016, Oxford Dictionaries selected \u201cpost-truth\u201d as the word of the year, defining it as \u201crelating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\u201d The 2016 Brexit vote in the United Kingdom and the tumultuous U.S. presidential election highlighted how the digital age has affected news and cultural narratives. New information platforms feed the ancient instinct people have to find information that syncs with their perspectives: A 2016 study that analyzed 376 million Facebook users\u2019 interactions with over 900 news outlets found that people tend to seek information that aligns with their views.

This study aims to explore the delayed and combinatory responses of online public opinion to the intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we seek to answer the following questions: (a) Is there a temporal delay in the response of online public opinion to the intensity of the pandemic? (b) Does this delay exhibit general characteristics of social networks, such as combinatory effects and higher-order interactions? To address these questions, we employ natural language processing techniques to extract online public opinion data and utilize statistical and machine learning-based causal inference methods for analysis. The findings indicate that online public opinion\u2019s response to the intensity of COVID-19 is not immediate but rather exhibits a long-term lag. Identical COVID-19 intensity data can trigger multiple delayed public opinion responses, while a single delayed public opinion datum may be influenced by multiple preceding COVID-19 intensity data points. This delayed response of online public opinion and its higher-order network characteristics result in a waveform structure of real-world impacts influenced by online public opinion.

False and out-of-context information is largely propagated by people looking to distort public opinion and advance particular agendas. Disinformation is often advanced in four key ways, according to two experts. Social media has ushered in an era of unprecedented connectivity. Yet it has also allowed disinformation and so-called fake news campaigns to proliferate and flourish. Disinformation\u2014which includes false and out-of-context information spread with the intent to deceive or mislead\u2014is largely propagated by people looking to distort public opinion and advance particular agendas. \u201cKey is how they exploit the inherent openness and opaqueness of the content ecosystem,\u201d explained Doowan Lee and Adean Mills Golub, two experts on disinformation analysis and the co-founders of Veracity Authentication Systems Technology (VAST). Disinformation can be propagated by a host of online actors, including governments, state-backed entities, extremist groups and individuals. For example, the World Economic Forum recently reported how one anonymous anti-Semitic account on the image board 4chan sparked a misinformation campaign that targeted the Forum. At VAST, Lee and Mills Golub monitor content from over 10 billion websites in 75 languages to track how content spreads online. Disinformation campaigns, according to Lee and Mills Golub, are propagated in four key ways: Social engineering: Providing a framework to mischaracterize and manipulate events, incidents, issues and public discourse.

This was in a busy but peaceful shopping district, and the shop was filled with families. A man brought a rifle into the shop and began shooting. Fortunately, no one was hurt, and the suspect was arrested, but the motive for this crime and the circumstances that triggered it were shocking. The pizza shop, called Comet Ping Pong, had become embroiled in a strange situation due to an event that had occurred about one month earlier. There were false tweets widely spread on the net claiming that this pizza shop was the base for a pedophile sex ring involving Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, a former Secretary of State, and members of her campaign. The operators of the pizza shop began receiving threats from right wing activists who believed that the reports were true. According to The Washington Post, the trigger was the announcement on October 28 about the resumption of the investigation by the Federal Bureau of investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) into the issue of the use of private e-mail by Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State. Two days later, there was a large volume of tweets about newly-discovered e-mail related to a pedophile sex ring. These posts were spread on anonymous bulletin board sites and via social media; and there were many abusive videos directed at Ms. Clinton posted on extreme-right-wing sites. Two days before the election, the FBI announced that they had reached a conclusion that they woul",

Fake news and the spread of misinformation: A research roundup by Denise-Marie Ordway, The Journalist's Resource September 1, 2017 It\u2019s too soon to say whether Google\u2019s\u00a0and Facebook\u2019s attempts to clamp down on fake news will have a significant impact. But fabricated stories posing as serious journalism are not likely to go away as they have become a means for some writers to make money and potentially influence public opinion. Even as Americans recognize that fake news causes confusion about current issues and events, they continue to circulate it. A December 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center suggests that 23 percent of U.S. adults have shared fake news, knowingly or unknowingly, with friends and others. \u201cFake news\u201d is a term that can mean different things, depending on the context. News satire is often called fake news as are parodies such as the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d mock newscast Weekend Update. Much of the fake news that flooded the internet during the 2016 election season consisted of written pieces and recorded segments promoting false information or perpetuating conspiracy theories. Some news organizations published reports spotlighting examples of hoaxes, fake news and misinformation\u00a0on Election Day 2016. The news media has written a lot about fake news and other forms of misinformation, but scholars are still trying to understand it \u2014 for example, how it travels and why some people believe it and even seek it out.

A review of some recent public opinion research shows just how much. For example, an NPR survey conducted earlier this year found that 64% of the American population believes that U.S. democracy is in crisis and is at risk of failing. A strong indication that the situation is getting worse and not better is that over 70% of respondents in that poll said that democracy is more at risk of failure now than it was a year ago. Similarly, a Quinnipiac University survey reveals that 76% of respondents think political instability within the country is a bigger danger to the United States than external adversaries. Amazingly, this suggests that Americans recognize that we are a bigger threat to our own democracy than any other potential external threat. Sadly, according to this poll, over half of Americans (53%) expect political divisions in the country to worsen over their lifetime rather than get better. One of the drivers of decreased confidence in the political system has been the explosion of misinformation deliberately aimed at disrupting the democratic process. This confuses and overwhelms voters. Throughout the 2020 election cycle, Russia\u2019s cyber efforts and online actors were able to influence public perceptions and sought to amplify mistrust in the electoral process by denigrating mail-in voting, highlighting alleged irregularities, and accusing the Democratic Party of engaging in voter fraud. The \u201cbig lie\u201d reinforced by President Trump about the 2020 election results amplified the Russian efforts and has lasting implications on voters\u2019 trust in election outcomes. The Collaborative Multi-Racial Political Study reveals that a robust 57% of white Americans believes there was voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election, including 26% of whom believe th",

In a review published Aug. 3 in the journal Trends in Cognitive Sciences, social scientists from Northwestern University describe how the misalignment between the objective of social media algorithms, designed to boost user engagement, and functions of human psychology can lead to increased polarization and misinformation. \u201cThere are reputational components that Twitter and Facebook must face when it comes to elections and the spread of misinformation,\u201d said the article\u2019s first author William Brady. \u201cThe social platforms also stand to benefit from better aligning their algorithms to improve user experience.\u201d Brady is a social psychologist in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. \u201cWe wanted to put out a systematic review to help explain how human psychology and algorithms interact in ways that can have these consequences,\u201d Brady said. \u201cOne of the things that this review brings to the table is a social learning perspective. This framework is fundamentally important if we want to understand how algorithms influence our social interactions.\u201d Humans are predisposed to learning from those they perceive as having prestige or influence within their group to cooperate and survive. However, with the advent of diverse and complex modern communities \u2014 and especially in social media \u2014 these predisposed learning biases become less effective. For example, a person we are connected to online might not necessarily be trustworthy, and people can easily feign prestige on social media. When learning biases were first evolving, morally and emotionally charged information was important to prioritize, as this information was likely to be relevant to enforcing group norms and ensuring collective survival.

The changing social landscape, marked by the transition from the \u201cnetwork society\u201d to the \u201cplatform society,\u201d has given rise to unprecedented phenomena such as cancel culture. Rooted in social media complaints, cancel culture intersects with the dissemination of intentionally created false information, forming a complex web of dynamics.

There is growing anxiety over this practice of publicly shaming people online for violating social norms ranging from inappropriate jokes to controversial business practices. Online shaming can be a wildly disproportionate response that violates the privacy of the shamed while offering them no good way to defend themselves. These consequences lead some critics to claim that online shaming creates a \u201chate storm\u201d that destroys lives and reputations, leaves targets with \u201cpermanent digital baggage\u201d and threatens the fundamental right to publicly express yourself in a democracy.

I\u2019m a political scientist who studies the relationship between digital technologies and democracy. In my research, I show how public shaming can be a valuable tool for democratic accountability. However, it is more likely to provide these positive effects within a clearly defined community whose members have many overlapping connections. When shaming helps Public shaming is a \u201chorizontal\u201d form of social sanctioning, in which people hold one another responsible for violating social norms, rather than appealing to higher authorities to do so. This makes it especially useful in democratic societies, as well as in cases where the shamers face power imbalances or lack access to formal authorities that could hold the shamed accountable. For example, public shaming can be an effective strategy for challenging corporate power and behavior or maintaining journalistic norms in the face of plagiarism.

Social media has fostered a hostile environment in which cancel culture thrives because each user has given themselves the jurisdiction to determine someone\u2019s reputation. The most significant issue with cancel culture is that it reduces one\u2019s character to one defining moment or mistake. Due to this severe judgement, cancel culture leads to tarnished reputations, decreasing mental health, and encourages self-censorship. Cancel culture is primarily perpetuated by psychological components that satisfy innate desires many people have to feel morally superior over their peers and conform to majority opinion. As a result, cancelling someone as a form of punishment is a long-standing practice, only it was known as public shaming. The resurgence of public shaming is greatly due to the increasing use of social media, which provides a platform for more people to both speak out against perceived wrongs, as well as participate in shaming the people who commit those transgressions. While cancel culture has provided a platform for marginalized groups whose voices have been historically suppressed to call out problematic people and behavior, the fear of enduring ridicule has encouraged self-censorship more than it has encouraged freedom of expression. Plausible solutions for decreasing the intensity of cancel culture would involve individual alterations in behavior such as enforcing radical honesty in order to contribute to an overall cultural shift in diminishing shame culture overall. 1.

First used in 2016, the phrase cancel culture, also known as callout culture, is the removal (\u201ccanceling\u201d) of support for individuals (and their work), a group of people, an organization, or a company due to an opinion or action on their part deemed objectionable to the parties \u201ccalling\u201d them out.\u00a0[1][35] (This article first appeared on ProCon.org and was last updated on August 16, 2023.) Those being canceled are typically first called out on\u00a0social media\u00a0to magnify public knowledge of the perceived offense, whereupon the campaign to cancel ensues. The canceling can take several forms, including the exerting of pressure on organizations to cancel the public appearances or speaking engagements of the canceled parties and, in the case of businesses deemed offensive, organizing\u00a0boycotts\u00a0of their products. [1] Celebrities and social and political leaders are frequently the targets of cancel campaigns.\u00a0Actor and comedian\u00a0Bill Cosby, who was found guilty in 2018 of drugging and sexually assaulting a woman and accused of assault by more than 50 women, is only one of many recent high-profile examples. But everyday, people can be caught in the crosshairs as well. A public relations executive, for example, tweeted an offensive joke about\u00a0AIDS\u00a0before boarding a plane in London to travel to\u00a0South Africa. An uproar on\u00a0Twitter\u00a0(now called X) followed, and by the time her plane landed, she had been \u201ccalled out,\u201d \u201ccanceled,\u201d and fired from her job.\u00a0[2][3] The cancel campaigns are not always so successful or one-sided.

They do so across a wide variety of countries, political beliefs and demographic characteristics. Instances of backfire, wherein exposure to corrections reduce accuracy, are exceedingly rare and may be an artifact of research design. The evidence regarding other common concerns is mixed. While the effects on corrections on belief are not permanent, they are not entirely ephemeral, either. With some exceptions, corrections mostly only affect belief accuracy, with minor to nonexistent influence on downstream attitudes and behaviors. While corrections are not unpopular among the public, limited available evidence suggests that those who see misinformation are exceedingly unlikely to see relevant corrections. Introduction People exposed to factual corrections targeting misinformation become more factually accurate, compared to those who have only seen the misinformation. Effective corrections of misinformation can be produced by professional fact-checking organizations [1] and by ordinary citizens [2]. Factual corrections increase belief accuracy among those who have seen misinformation, across a wide variety of demographic profiles and nationalities [3]. Apart from the effects on belief accuracy, however, the science of factual corrections is less settled.

Humanities and Social Sciences Communications volume\u00a010, Article\u00a0number:\u00a0867 (2023) Cite this article 2680 Accesses 1 Citations Metrics details Subjects Abstract Recently, crowdsourcing has been proposed as a tool for fighting misinformation online. Will internet users listen to crowdsourced fact-checking, and how? In this experiment we test how participants follow others\u2019 opinions to evaluate the validity of a science-themed Facebook post and examine which factors mediate the use of this information. Participants observed a post presenting either scientific information or misinformation, along with a graphical summary of previous participants\u2019 judgements. Even though most participants reported not having used information from previous raters, their responses were influenced by previous assessments. This happened regardless of whether prior judgements were accurate or misleading. Presenting crowdsourced fact-checking however did not translate into the blind copying of the majority response. Rather, participants tended to use this social information as a cue to guide their response, while also relying on individual evaluation and research for extra information. These results highlight the role of individual reasoning when evaluating online information, while pointing to the potential benefit of crowd-sourcing-based solutions in making online users more resilient to misinformation.

Fact-checks on information often fall behind the diffusion of misinformation, which can lead to negative impacts on society. This research studies how different factors may affect the spread of fact-checks over the internet. We collected a dataset of fact-checks in a six-month period and analyzed how they spread on Twitter. The spread of fact-checks is measured by the total retweet count. The factors/variables include the truthfulness rating, topic of information, source credibility, etc. The research identifies truthfulness rating as a significant factor: conclusive fact-checks (either true or false) tend to be shared more than others. In addition, the source credibility, political leaning, and the sharing count also affect the spread of fact-checks. The findings of this research provide practical insights into accelerating the spread of the truth in the battle against misinformation online.

But fabricated stories posing as serious journalism are not likely to go away as they have become a means for some writers to make money and potentially influence public opinion. Even as Americans recognize that fake news causes confusion about current issues and events, they continue to circulate it. A December 2016 survey by the Pew Research Center suggests that 23 percent of U.S. adults have shared fake news, knowingly or unknowingly, with friends and others. \u201cFake news\u201d is a term that can mean different things, depending on the context. News satire is often called fake news as are parodies such as the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d mock newscast Weekend Update. Much of the fake news that flooded the internet during the 2016 election season consisted of written pieces and recorded segments promoting false information or perpetuating conspiracy theories. Some news organizations published reports spotlighting examples of hoaxes, fake news and misinformation\u00a0on Election Day 2016. The news media has written a lot about fake news and other forms of misinformation, but scholars are still trying to understand it \u2014 for example, how it travels and why some people believe it and even seek it out. Below, Journalist\u2019s Resource has pulled together academic studies to help newsrooms better understand the problem and its\u00a0impacts. Two other resources that may be helpful are the Poyn",

However, the dominant role of search engines in the information environment remains underexplored, even though the use of online search to evaluate the veracity of information is a central component of media literacy interventions3,4,5. Although conventional wisdom suggests that searching online when evaluating misinformation would reduce belief in it, there is little empirical evidence to evaluate this claim. Here, across five experiments, we present consistent evidence that online search to evaluate the truthfulness of false news articles actually increases the probability of believing them. To shed light on this relationship, we combine survey data with digital trace data collected using a custom browser extension. We find that the search effect is concentrated among individuals for whom search engines return lower-quality information. Our results indicate that those who search online to evaluate misinformation risk falling into data voids, or informational spaces in which there is corroborating evidence from low-quality sources. We also find consistent evidence that searching online to evaluate news increases belief in true news from low-quality sources, but inconsistent evidence that it increases belief in true news from mainstream sources. Our findings highlight the need for media literacy programmes to ground thei",

Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a motion.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nIn this debate, we shall argue that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice.  Online public opinion trials are defined as situations where legal cases or controversies are extensively discussed and debated in online public forums, potentially influencing legal proceedings or outcomes. This includes social media discussions, online petitions, and citizen journalism efforts related to legal matters. Justice is a state of affairs in which fairness, equity, and the rule of law prevail, ensuring that individuals receive due process, appropriate punishments or remedies, and protection from harm.  \"Closer to Justice\" means progress towards a more just outcome, increasing fairness, equity, and adherence to the rule of law in legal processes and outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. The side that best demonstrates a net positive impact on society's pursuit of justice, considering factors like fairness, accuracy, accountability, access to justice, and protection of individual rights, should win.  This framework is appropriate because the motion is fundamentally about whether online public opinion trials improve or hinder the overall effectiveness and fairness of the justice system.\n\nFirst, online public opinion trials enhance transparency and accountability within the legal system.  Increased public scrutiny through online platforms holds legal actors accountable, exposes misconduct, and promotes fairness. For example, in 2021, public outcry on social media following the police killing of Elijah McClain contributed to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [1].  Studies show that public pressure resulting from online scrutiny can lead to police reforms and investigations into misconduct [2]. This transparency and accountability are crucial for a just legal system, as highlighted by research on the role of transparency in good governance [3].\n\nSecond, online platforms amplify marginalized voices and facilitate access to justice. Traditional legal processes can be inaccessible or biased against certain groups.  Online platforms provide avenues for marginalized communities to share their experiences, organize legal support, and advocate for their rights.  Research indicates that online campaigns have played a key role in legal reforms benefiting marginalized groups, such as the #MeToo movement raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault [4]. This increased access to justice and amplified voice for the marginalized contributes to a more equitable legal system.\n\nThird, online public opinion trials facilitate information sharing and public education about legal issues, improving public understanding and engagement with the justice system. Open online discussions about legal cases can educate the public about legal principles, processes, and potential biases, fostering informed participation in legal and political discourse.  For instance, online discussions surrounding high-profile court cases often involve explanations of complex legal concepts, making them more accessible to the general public. This increased awareness ultimately strengthens the pursuit of justice.  A study by [5] demonstrated that online discussions of hypothetical legal problems led to deeper analysis and critical thinking among participants.\n\nIn conclusion, by fostering transparency and accountability, amplifying marginalized voices, and promoting public education, online public opinion trials ultimately contribute to a more just and equitable legal system, bringing us closer to, not further from, justice.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Change.org.

        "content": "**My opening statement**\n\nFriends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice. While the proposition paints a rosy picture of increased transparency and amplified voices, we argue that these supposed benefits are overshadowed by the inherent dangers of online trials, which ultimately obstruct the path to true justice.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \u201conline public opinion trials.\u201d We define them as instances where individuals are subjected to public judgment and condemnation online, often based on incomplete information and fueled by emotional responses, before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.  Our judging criteria today should be minimizing harm.  The side that best demonstrates how their interpretation of online public opinion trials minimizes harm to individuals and the integrity of the legal system should win this debate.  This framework is crucial because justice is not simply about speed or perceived public satisfaction; it's about ensuring fairness, due process, and protecting individual rights.\n\nNow, let me turn to our first point: online public opinion trials readily devolve into vigilantism. Consider this: you are accused of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, and before you even step into a courtroom, your reputation is tarnished, your life threatened, all based on incomplete information circulating online. Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism [1] notes public shaming as a common tactic, highlighting how online platforms are weaponized to enact extrajudicial \u201cjustice.\u201d  This bypasses due process, fostering mob rule and undermining the legal system. The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment, creating a climate of fear and intimidation rather than justice.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices. Studies like \"Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement\" [2] show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers that reinforce existing biases. These platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly and influence public perception, thus moving us further from impartial justice. Imagine a scenario where you\u2019re judged not on the facts of a case, but on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth. That is the reality of online public opinion trials.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the crucial issue here is that online public opinion trials disproportionately affect marginalized communities.  They face a double disadvantage. First, as revealed in \"Challenges to Continuity During the COVID-19 Pandemic - PMC\" [3], many lack access to technology or the skills to navigate online spaces, limiting their ability to participate and counter misinformation. Second, \"Introduction: Marginality and Social Media\" [4] explains how existing power imbalances are amplified online, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation and online harassment. As you'll see, this combination of exclusion and amplified vulnerability exacerbates existing marginalization and undermines fair representation, moving us further from a just society.  \n\nIn conclusion, while the allure of online public opinion trials might seem appealing on the surface, we believe that their inherent dangers\u2014vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate harm to marginalized communities\u2014pose a significant threat to the very foundations of our justice system.  We urge you to consider the real-world consequences of these trials and stand with us in opposition.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1]  Wikipedia. *Internet vigilantism*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism\n[2]  Yogeeswaran, Kumar, and Joel S.

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement mischaracterizes online public opinion trials, offering a narrow definition, a restrictive judging criterion, and a pessimistic outlook on their potential for good. We, the affirmative team, contend that online public opinion trials, broadly defined, contribute significantly to the pursuit of justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the negative team\u2019s narrow definition of online public opinion trials as mere online judgment and condemnation ignores the multifaceted nature of online discourse related to legal issues.  Our broader definition, encompassing discussions, analyses, and information sharing, is more appropriate because it reflects the reality of how people engage with legal matters online.  Platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and the Electronic Case Filings websites of various courts [2] exemplify this, providing accessible legal information and promoting transparency, thereby fostering a more informed citizenry crucial for a just society. By excluding these vital functions, the negative\u2019s definition weakens their argument. Our broader definition, encompassing the educational and informative aspects of online engagement, strengthens our case by demonstrating how these platforms enhance public understanding of the legal system, a cornerstone of achieving justice.\n\nSecond, the negative team\u2019s focus on \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criterion is overly cautious and insufficient for evaluating the complex impact of online public opinion trials.  Maximizing societal benefit, our proposed criterion, is superior because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.  This holistic approach aligns with the core principles of justice, which seek not just to avoid harm, but also to actively promote fairness and equity.  A study in the Journal of Information Policy [3] highlights how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable, directly contributing to a more just society.  By focusing solely on minimizing harm, the negative team neglects the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice, thus weakening their argument and strengthening ours.\n\nThird, the negative team\u2019s claim that online public opinion trials inevitably lead to vigilantism is an unfounded generalization.  While acknowledging potential risks, we argue that vigilantism is not an inherent outcome of online discussions. Many platforms actively moderate content [4], and research suggests that online discussions often center on raising awareness, supporting victims, and advocating for legal reforms [5].  These positive contributions are crucial for achieving justice and are entirely disregarded by the negative team.  Their focus on a potential negative outcome, while ignoring the demonstrable positive impacts, weakens their argument and strengthens our position that online platforms can be powerful tools for positive change.\n\nFourth, the negative team's argument that online platforms amplify biases, while true, overlooks their unique capacity to *mitigate* bias by providing diverse perspectives and amplifying marginalized voices. While traditional media can also amplify bias, as discussed in [6], online platforms offer a unique opportunity for counter-speech and the dissemination of alternative viewpoints [7]. This ability to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more inclusive public discourse is crucial for achieving a just society. By focusing solely on the potential for bias amplification, the negative team ignores the unique potential of online platforms to promote balanced and informed public discourse\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Cornell Law School.

You should stand firm on your position (OPPOSE the motion) and attack the opponent's weak points.\nYour position is to OPPOSE the motion. The opponent is to SUPPORT the motion.\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Structure of a Rebuttal\nA complete rebuttal should consist of multiple points, with each point containing four parts:\n- **Lead-in:** Introduce the opponent's argument, evidence, reasoning, etc., that you will be refuting.\n- **Explanation:** Briefly explain the opponent's argument to ensure clarity.\n- **Rebuttal:** This is the core of your point.

This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment (\"5_5\", \"5_6\") and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities (\"7_20\", \"7_23\"). Such trials prioritize public sentiment over legal processes, failing to maximize societal benefit and potentially causing significant harm.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: {'claim': 'Minimizing harm is an insufficient criterion for evaluating online public opinion trials.', 'argument': ['The affirmative team suggests that maximizing societal benefit is a superior criterion because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.', 'They argue that this holistic approach aligns better with the core principles of justice, which aim to promote fairness and equity.', 'They cite a study in the Journal of Information Policy highlighting how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable.']}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_45', 'query': 'Negative consequences of online public opinion trials', 'title': 'Online public opinion evaluation through the functional resonance ...', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34972099/'}, {'id': '6_47', 'query': 'Negative consequences of online public opinion trials', 'title': 'Online public opinion dissemination model and simulation under media ...', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960077922011389'}]\n**Short Argument**: Maximizing societal benefit as the sole criterion for evaluating online public opinion trials is insufficient and dangerous. While positive contributions exist, focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm, like the spread of misinformation (\"6_47\") and negative public opinion outbreaks (\"6_45\") documented in studies. These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote.  A balanced approach that prioritizes minimizing harm is crucial for true societal benefit.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: {'claim': 'Online public opinion trials encourage vigilantism and mob justice.', 'argument': ['Online platforms can be used to publicly shame and condemn individuals before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.', 'This bypasses due process and fosters mob rule, undermining the legal system.', 'The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment.', \"Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism notes public shaming as a common tactic.\"]}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_0', 'query': 'Examples of online public opinion trials leading to vigilantism', 'title': 'Internet vigilantism - Wikipedia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism'}, {'id': '5_2', 'query': 'Examples of online public opinion trials leading to vigilantism', 'title': 'Unmasking cyber vigilantism: MRU prof explores online justice', 'url': 'https://www.mtroyal.ca/AboutMountRoyal/MediaRoom/Stories/2023/12/unmasking-cyber-vigilantism.htm'}, {'id': '5_5', 'query': 'Cases of online shaming leading to offline harassment or violence', 'title': 'Connections Between Online Harassment and Offline Violence among Youth ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4461520/'}, {'id': '5_7', 'query': 'Cases of online shaming leading to offline harassment or violence', 'title': 'Co-occurrence of online and offline bullying and sexual harassment ...', 'url': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9543120/'}]\n\n**Medium Argument**: The very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms like X and TikTok enable rapid dissemination of accusations and judgments, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process can take place (5_2).  This online shaming often spills into offline harassment and violence, as documented in cases where online and offline bullying/harassment co-occur (5_7, 5_5). The speed and breadth of social media amplify the potential for misjudgment and disproportionate punishment.  While some online discussions might focus on awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics mentioned even in Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism (5_0). Thus, these trials create an environment ripe for mob justice, undermining the legal system.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: {'claim': 'Online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices.', 'argument': ['Studies show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers.', 'Online platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly.', 'Individuals are judged based on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth.', 'The study \"Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement\" supports the claim of bias amplification.']}\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_0', 'query': 'How online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices', 'title': 'Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based ...', 'url': 'https://academic.oup.com/joc/article/73/5/463/7190600'}, {'id': '8_45', 'query': 'Influence of online echo chambers on individual perspectives', 'title': 'Echo Chamber - (Race and Gender in Media) - Fiveable', 'url': 'https://fiveable.me/key-terms/race-and-gender-in-media/echo-chamber'}, {'id': '1_6', 'query': 'What is the relationship between social media and misinformation?', 'title': 'How Social Media Amplifies Misinformation More Than ...', 'url': 'https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/13/technology/misinformation-integrity-institute-report.html'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Online public opinion trials exacerbate biases.  Prejudiced individuals naturally seek confirming information online, creating echo chambers (8_45). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate rapidly (1_6).

        "content": "**My rebuttal statement**\n\nFriends, judges, and esteemed audience, the affirmative team\u2019s arguments, while superficially appealing, fail to address the fundamental flaws of online public opinion trials. Their attempts to redefine the motion, shift the judging criteria, and downplay the inherent risks only serve to highlight the weakness of their position.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address their broad definition of online public opinion trials. While resources like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and Electronic Case Filings websites [2] undoubtedly offer valuable legal information, they are distinct from the often-toxic environment of online public opinion trials.  These trials, as we defined, involve public judgment and condemnation, often based on incomplete information.  This distinction is crucial.  While legal information platforms promote informed citizenry, online trials frequently devolve into biased, emotionally-charged judgments.  This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment ([3], [4]) and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities ([5], [6]).\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider their proposed judging criteria of \"maximizing societal benefit.\"  While a laudable goal, it's dangerously incomplete.  Focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm. Studies document the spread of misinformation [7] and negative public opinion outbreaks [8] resulting from online trials.  These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote. A balanced approach, prioritizing minimizing harm, is crucial. Imagine being subjected to a trial by social media, your reputation tarnished before due process, based on misinformation amplified by algorithms. Where is the societal benefit in that?\n\nThe affirmative\u2019s claim that vigilantism isn\u2019t an inherent outcome of online discussions is simply wishful thinking.  While content moderation exists, the very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms enable rapid dissemination of accusations, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process ( [9]). This often spills into offline harassment and violence, documented in cases where online and offline bullying co-occur ([10], [3]).  While some online discussions might raise awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics ( [9]).  Think about how quickly misinformation spreads online, how easily individuals can be targeted and harassed.  This is not justice; it's a dangerous erosion of due process.\n\nFinally, their argument about mitigating bias ignores the reality of echo chambers.  Prejudiced individuals seek confirming information online ( [11]). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate [12].  Individuals are judged based on amplified pre-existing biases [13], hindering impartial justice.  Their claim of diverse perspectives is often drowned out by the cacophony of biased information amplified by algorithms designed for engagement, not truth.\n\nFurthermore, let's address the critical issue of due process.  Social media's rapid information dissemination leads to premature judgments, impacting due process integrity ( [14]). This instantaneous nature bypasses the structured, evidence-based legal process, creating a \"trial by social media\" environment ([15]). This undermines the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial ([16]), jeopardizing impartiality.  Consider the potential consequences: your life upended by online accusations before you have a chance to defend yourself in a court of law. This is not justice; this is a dangerous perversion of it.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Cornell Law School. *Legal Information Institute*. www.law.cornell.edu/lii/\n[2] Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. pacer.gov\n[3]  Hinduja, Sameer, and Justin W.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of online public opinion trials on the pursuit of justice. While our opponents have focused on potential harms, we maintain that these platforms, when understood broadly, bring us closer to justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nOur opponents define online public opinion trials narrowly as mere \"judgment and condemnation.\" However, this ignores the multifaceted nature of online engagement with legal issues.  Online platforms are crucial for sharing information, fostering discussions, and promoting legal education. These activities, which *precede* judgment, empower citizens to form nuanced opinions and contribute to a more informed public discourse. Studies show online discussions can lead to deeper analysis and critical thinking about legal issues [17].  Moreover, online platforms have facilitated positive legal outcomes, such as petitions leading to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [19] and crowdsourced investigations helping identify suspects in criminal cases [10].\n\nThe negative team advocates for \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criteria.  While harm reduction is important, their narrow focus overlooks the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice. Our criterion, \"maximizing societal benefit,\" encompasses both harm reduction and the active promotion of justice.  Increased transparency, a key feature of online discussions, holds legal actors accountable [9] and promotes fairness [8].  Furthermore, online platforms amplify marginalized voices [12], ensuring their concerns are heard and addressed, contributing to a more equitable legal system.\n\nOur opponents raise valid concerns about due process\n\n**Reference**\n(1)  Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. *Manufacturing Consent*.

        "In this debate, we shall argue that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice.  Online public opinion trials are defined as situations where legal cases or controversies are extensively discussed and debated in online public forums, potentially influencing legal proceedings or outcomes. This includes social media discussions, online petitions, and citizen journalism efforts related to legal matters. Justice is a state of affairs in which fairness, equity, and the rule of law prevail, ensuring that individuals receive due process, appropriate punishments or remedies, and protection from harm.  \"Closer to Justice\" means progress towards a more just outcome, increasing fairness, equity, and adherence to the rule of law in legal processes and outcomes.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. The side that best demonstrates a net positive impact on society's pursuit of justice, considering factors like fairness, accuracy, accountability, access to justice, and protection of individual rights, should win.  This framework is appropriate because the motion is fundamentally about whether online public opinion trials improve or hinder the overall effectiveness and fairness of the justice system.\n\nFirst, online public opinion trials enhance transparency and accountability within the legal system.  Increased public scrutiny through online platforms holds legal actors accountable, exposes misconduct, and promotes fairness. For example, in 2021, public outcry on social media following the police killing of Elijah McClain contributed to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [1].  Studies show that public pressure resulting from online scrutiny can lead to police reforms and investigations into misconduct [2]. This transparency and accountability are crucial for a just legal system, as highlighted by research on the role of transparency in good governance [3].\n\nSecond, online platforms amplify marginalized voices and facilitate access to justice. Traditional legal processes can be inaccessible or biased against certain groups.  Online platforms provide avenues for marginalized communities to share their experiences, organize legal support, and advocate for their rights.  Research indicates that online campaigns have played a key role in legal reforms benefiting marginalized groups, such as the #MeToo movement raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault [4]. This increased access to justice and amplified voice for the marginalized contributes to a more equitable legal system.\n\nThird, online public opinion trials facilitate information sharing and public education about legal issues, improving public understanding and engagement with the justice system. Open online discussions about legal cases can educate the public about legal principles, processes, and potential biases, fostering informed participation in legal and political discourse.  For instance, online discussions surrounding high-profile court cases often involve explanations of complex legal concepts, making them more accessible to the general public. This increased awareness ultimately strengthens the pursuit of justice.  A study by [5] demonstrated that online discussions of hypothetical legal problems led to deeper analysis and critical thinking among participants.\n\nIn conclusion, by fostering transparency and accountability, amplifying marginalized voices, and promoting public education, online public opinion trials ultimately contribute to a more just and equitable legal system, bringing us closer to, not further from, justice.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Change.org.

        "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent\u2019s opening statement mischaracterizes online public opinion trials, offering a narrow definition, a restrictive judging criterion, and a pessimistic outlook on their potential for good. We, the affirmative team, contend that online public opinion trials, broadly defined, contribute significantly to the pursuit of justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nFirst, the negative team\u2019s narrow definition of online public opinion trials as mere online judgment and condemnation ignores the multifaceted nature of online discourse related to legal issues.  Our broader definition, encompassing discussions, analyses, and information sharing, is more appropriate because it reflects the reality of how people engage with legal matters online.  Platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and the Electronic Case Filings websites of various courts [2] exemplify this, providing accessible legal information and promoting transparency, thereby fostering a more informed citizenry crucial for a just society. By excluding these vital functions, the negative\u2019s definition weakens their argument. Our broader definition, encompassing the educational and informative aspects of online engagement, strengthens our case by demonstrating how these platforms enhance public understanding of the legal system, a cornerstone of achieving justice.\n\nSecond, the negative team\u2019s focus on \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criterion is overly cautious and insufficient for evaluating the complex impact of online public opinion trials.  Maximizing societal benefit, our proposed criterion, is superior because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.  This holistic approach aligns with the core principles of justice, which seek not just to avoid harm, but also to actively promote fairness and equity.  A study in the Journal of Information Policy [3] highlights how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable, directly contributing to a more just society.  By focusing solely on minimizing harm, the negative team neglects the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice, thus weakening their argument and strengthening ours.\n\nThird, the negative team\u2019s claim that online public opinion trials inevitably lead to vigilantism is an unfounded generalization.  While acknowledging potential risks, we argue that vigilantism is not an inherent outcome of online discussions. Many platforms actively moderate content [4], and research suggests that online discussions often center on raising awareness, supporting victims, and advocating for legal reforms [5].  These positive contributions are crucial for achieving justice and are entirely disregarded by the negative team.  Their focus on a potential negative outcome, while ignoring the demonstrable positive impacts, weakens their argument and strengthens our position that online platforms can be powerful tools for positive change.\n\nFourth, the negative team's argument that online platforms amplify biases, while true, overlooks their unique capacity to *mitigate* bias by providing diverse perspectives and amplifying marginalized voices. While traditional media can also amplify bias, as discussed in [6], online platforms offer a unique opportunity for counter-speech and the dissemination of alternative viewpoints [7]. This ability to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more inclusive public discourse is crucial for achieving a just society. By focusing solely on the potential for bias amplification, the negative team ignores the unique potential of online platforms to promote balanced and informed public discourse\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Cornell Law School.

        "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of online public opinion trials on the pursuit of justice. While our opponents have focused on potential harms, we maintain that these platforms, when understood broadly, bring us closer to justice by maximizing societal benefit.\n\nOur opponents define online public opinion trials narrowly as mere \"judgment and condemnation.\" However, this ignores the multifaceted nature of online engagement with legal issues.  Online platforms are crucial for sharing information, fostering discussions, and promoting legal education. These activities, which *precede* judgment, empower citizens to form nuanced opinions and contribute to a more informed public discourse. Studies show online discussions can lead to deeper analysis and critical thinking about legal issues [17].  Moreover, online platforms have facilitated positive legal outcomes, such as petitions leading to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [19] and crowdsourced investigations helping identify suspects in criminal cases [10].\n\nThe negative team advocates for \"minimizing harm\" as the judging criteria.  While harm reduction is important, their narrow focus overlooks the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice. Our criterion, \"maximizing societal benefit,\" encompasses both harm reduction and the active promotion of justice.  Increased transparency, a key feature of online discussions, holds legal actors accountable [9] and promotes fairness [8].  Furthermore, online platforms amplify marginalized voices [12], ensuring their concerns are heard and addressed, contributing to a more equitable legal system.\n\nOur opponents raise valid concerns about due process\n\n**Reference**\n(1)  Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. *Manufacturing Consent*.

        "Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice. While the proposition paints a rosy picture of increased transparency and amplified voices, we argue that these supposed benefits are overshadowed by the inherent dangers of online trials, which ultimately obstruct the path to true justice.  \n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by \u201conline public opinion trials.\u201d We define them as instances where individuals are subjected to public judgment and condemnation online, often based on incomplete information and fueled by emotional responses, before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.  Our judging criteria today should be minimizing harm.  The side that best demonstrates how their interpretation of online public opinion trials minimizes harm to individuals and the integrity of the legal system should win this debate.  This framework is crucial because justice is not simply about speed or perceived public satisfaction; it's about ensuring fairness, due process, and protecting individual rights.\n\nNow, let me turn to our first point: online public opinion trials readily devolve into vigilantism. Consider this: you are accused of a crime you didn\u2019t commit, and before you even step into a courtroom, your reputation is tarnished, your life threatened, all based on incomplete information circulating online. Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism [1] notes public shaming as a common tactic, highlighting how online platforms are weaponized to enact extrajudicial \u201cjustice.\u201d  This bypasses due process, fostering mob rule and undermining the legal system. The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment, creating a climate of fear and intimidation rather than justice.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices. Studies like \"Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement\" [2] show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers that reinforce existing biases. These platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly and influence public perception, thus moving us further from impartial justice. Imagine a scenario where you\u2019re judged not on the facts of a case, but on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth. That is the reality of online public opinion trials.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, the crucial issue here is that online public opinion trials disproportionately affect marginalized communities.  They face a double disadvantage. First, as revealed in \"Challenges to Continuity During the COVID-19 Pandemic - PMC\" [3], many lack access to technology or the skills to navigate online spaces, limiting their ability to participate and counter misinformation. Second, \"Introduction: Marginality and Social Media\" [4] explains how existing power imbalances are amplified online, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation and online harassment. As you'll see, this combination of exclusion and amplified vulnerability exacerbates existing marginalization and undermines fair representation, moving us further from a just society.  \n\nIn conclusion, while the allure of online public opinion trials might seem appealing on the surface, we believe that their inherent dangers\u2014vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate harm to marginalized communities\u2014pose a significant threat to the very foundations of our justice system.  We urge you to consider the real-world consequences of these trials and stand with us in opposition.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1]  Wikipedia. *Internet vigilantism*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism\n[2]  Yogeeswaran, Kumar, and Joel S.

        "Friends, judges, and esteemed audience, the affirmative team\u2019s arguments, while superficially appealing, fail to address the fundamental flaws of online public opinion trials. Their attempts to redefine the motion, shift the judging criteria, and downplay the inherent risks only serve to highlight the weakness of their position.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address their broad definition of online public opinion trials. While resources like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and Electronic Case Filings websites [2] undoubtedly offer valuable legal information, they are distinct from the often-toxic environment of online public opinion trials.  These trials, as we defined, involve public judgment and condemnation, often based on incomplete information.  This distinction is crucial.  While legal information platforms promote informed citizenry, online trials frequently devolve into biased, emotionally-charged judgments.  This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment ([3], [4]) and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities ([5], [6]).\n\nNext, let\u2019s consider their proposed judging criteria of \"maximizing societal benefit.\"  While a laudable goal, it's dangerously incomplete.  Focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm. Studies document the spread of misinformation [7] and negative public opinion outbreaks [8] resulting from online trials.  These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote. A balanced approach, prioritizing minimizing harm, is crucial. Imagine being subjected to a trial by social media, your reputation tarnished before due process, based on misinformation amplified by algorithms. Where is the societal benefit in that?\n\nThe affirmative\u2019s claim that vigilantism isn\u2019t an inherent outcome of online discussions is simply wishful thinking.  While content moderation exists, the very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms enable rapid dissemination of accusations, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process ( [9]). This often spills into offline harassment and violence, documented in cases where online and offline bullying co-occur ([10], [3]).  While some online discussions might raise awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics ( [9]).  Think about how quickly misinformation spreads online, how easily individuals can be targeted and harassed.  This is not justice; it's a dangerous erosion of due process.\n\nFinally, their argument about mitigating bias ignores the reality of echo chambers.  Prejudiced individuals seek confirming information online ( [11]). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate [12].  Individuals are judged based on amplified pre-existing biases [13], hindering impartial justice.  Their claim of diverse perspectives is often drowned out by the cacophony of biased information amplified by algorithms designed for engagement, not truth.\n\nFurthermore, let's address the critical issue of due process.  Social media's rapid information dissemination leads to premature judgments, impacting due process integrity ( [14]). This instantaneous nature bypasses the structured, evidence-based legal process, creating a \"trial by social media\" environment ([15]). This undermines the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial ([16]), jeopardizing impartiality.  Consider the potential consequences: your life upended by online accusations before you have a chance to defend yourself in a court of law. This is not justice; this is a dangerous perversion of it.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Cornell Law School. *Legal Information Institute*. www.law.cornell.edu/lii/\n[2] Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. pacer.gov\n[3]  Hinduja, Sameer, and Justin W.

        "**My closing statement**\n\nEsteemed judges, the core conflict in this debate revolves around the true nature of online public opinion trials: do they enhance or obstruct justice?  We firmly believe they obstruct justice. While the affirmative paints a picture of informed citizenry and amplified voices, they fail to grapple with the inherent dangers we\u2019ve highlighted.\n\nOur opponents\u2019 broad definition of online public opinion trials ignores the crucial distinction between information sharing and the toxic reality of online judgment and condemnation.  While platforms can educate, online trials often devolve into biased, emotionally-charged arenas.  Their focus on \u201cmaximizing societal benefit\u201d as the sole criterion overlooks the demonstrable harms: vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.  Imagine yourselves subjected to a trial by social media, judged not on facts but on amplified biases, your life upended by accusations before due process.  Where is the justice in that?\n\nWe have shown that online public opinion trials encourage vigilantism, bypassing due process and fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before having a chance to defend themselves.  These trials amplify existing prejudices, creating echo chambers where biased narratives proliferate.  They disproportionately harm marginalized communities, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.  The affirmative's arguments fail to address these fundamental flaws. Their vision of a more just society through online trials is, at best, naive, and at worst, dangerously misleading.  We urge you to reject this flawed notion and uphold the principles of due process, fairness, and true justice.  A just society is built on the foundations of a fair legal system, not the shifting sands of online opinion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. *Manufacturing Consent*.
