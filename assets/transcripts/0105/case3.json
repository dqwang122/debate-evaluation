      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that we should subsidize preschool, defined as government funding provided to reduce the cost of early childhood education programs for children aged 3-5, focusing on their cognitive, social, and emotional development.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. The optimal policy yields the greatest overall benefit to society, considering both short-term and long-term impacts on children, families, and the economy. This framework is appropriate because it encompasses the wide-ranging effects of preschool subsidies.\n\nFirst, preschool subsidies improve long-term educational outcomes and reduce societal inequalities. Research indicates that access to high-quality preschool, especially for children from low-income families, leads to improved school readiness [8].  The positive effects of universal, high-quality preschool persist through tenth grade, demonstrating sustained benefits [8]. Studies show that preschool programs improve children's cognitive and social-emotional development, leading to better academic performance throughout their schooling [8]. This, in turn, results in higher rates of high school graduation and college enrollment [9], ultimately creating a more educated and productive workforce, thus benefiting society.\n\nSecond, preschool subsidies provide substantial economic benefits. By enabling parents, especially mothers, to enter or remain in the workforce, subsidies boost family incomes and increase overall economic productivity [4].  One study found that expanding child care subsidies could boost a local economy significantly [4]. Affordable access to child care is crucial for supporting children's healthy development, enabling parents to work or attend school, and helping businesses and the overall economy thrive [4]. Moreover, the increased tax revenue from employed parents and the reduced need for future social services due to improved educational outcomes offset the cost of the subsidies, making them a fiscally responsible investment [1]. Research indicates that high-quality public preschool programs for disadvantaged children yield benefits that outweigh the costs [1].\n\nThird, preschool subsidies strengthen families and communities. Access to affordable, high-quality preschool reduces parental stress and improves family well-being [2, 8]. Stable use of subsidies supports continuity of care, positively impacting children's development and meeting families' needs [2]. Moreover, preschool fosters social and emotional development in children, preparing them to become engaged and responsible citizens [5]. These positive effects ripple through communities, potentially leading to stronger social cohesion and a reduction in crime rates in the long run.  Subsidies help bridge the opportunity gap for children from low-income families, contributing to a more equitable society [1].\n\n\nIn conclusion, subsidizing preschool is a worthwhile investment that generates significant positive returns for children, families, and society as a whole, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and equitable future.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE).

      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that we should subsidize preschool.  Our opponents have presented a vision of universal preschool as a panacea for societal ills, but we believe this vision is clouded by well-intentioned but ultimately misguided policy.  We contend that universal preschool subsidies are not only inefficient but also counterproductive, leading to unintended consequences that harm the very families and children they intend to help.\n\nOur judging criteria for this debate is maximizing the effectiveness of educational spending.  We believe that every dollar invested in education should yield the greatest possible return in terms of improved outcomes for children.  This framework is crucial because it prioritizes demonstrable results and responsible stewardship of public funds.\n\nFirst, let's address the misallocation of resources. While universal preschool sounds appealing, it spreads limited resources thinly across all families, regardless of need. Studies on targeted interventions for disadvantaged children, such as the Chicago Child-Parent Centers [1, 2], demonstrate significantly higher returns on investment.  These programs focus resources on those who benefit most, leading to substantial improvements in educational outcomes. By diverting funds towards universal preschool, we risk shortchanging these proven, targeted interventions and hindering overall educational progress.  We must prioritize effectiveness, not just broad access.\n\nNow, consider the impact on tuition costs.  Our opponents argue that subsidies make preschool more affordable.  However, a key study from the Heritage Foundation [3] shows that government-funded preschool creates an artificial demand, allowing private institutions to inflate tuition.  This is because government-funded preschools undercut private providers, creating a demand driven by subsidies, not actual market needs. This gives private preschools the opportunity to raise prices, as they are no longer solely competing on price and quality. As highlighted in the Penn Wharton Budget Model study [4], government intervention through subsidies and funding can lead to cost increases. This model shows increased costs linked to such programs are often financed through debt, burdening taxpayers. The combined effect of artificial demand and increased costs demonstrates how subsidies lead to higher tuition, impacting families and the broader economy. Subsidies may appear to increase access but fail to address underlying affordability issues and instead distort the market. This underscores how government-subsidized preschool inflates tuition due to artificial demand.\n\nFinally, let's examine the administrative burden. Expanding preschool programs necessitates a larger government bureaucracy to manage the influx of applications, allocate funds, and ensure compliance.  Research on the Child Care and Development Fund program [5, 6] reveals the existing administrative challenges. Scaling this program for universal preschool would exacerbate these challenges, requiring more staff, resources, and complex systems. This would divert resources away from educational services and negate the program's intended benefits. The Penn Wharton Budget Model study [4] projects increased government debt from such programs, partly due to higher administrative spending.  Considering that administrative expenses often consume 15% to 20% of total operating costs [7], the potential for significant financial strain is evident. While proponents tout long-term economic benefits, the immediate increase in bureaucratic overhead poses a considerable fiscal challenge.  We believe in responsible spending and maximizing the impact of each educational dollar.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Early Childhood Interventions: Benefits, Costs, and Savings. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB5014.html\n\n[2] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n\n[3] More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ... https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy\n\n[4] Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/\n\n[5] Improving Child Care Access, Affordability, and Stability in the Child ... https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/01/2024-04139/improving-child-care-access-affordability-and-stability-in-the-child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf\n\n[6] Keeping kids in care: Reducing administrative burden in state Child ... https://researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/148536\n\n[7] What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates. https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool\n"

      "side": "for",
      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, specifically regarding resource allocation, tuition costs, and administrative burden. They operate under a narrow framework of maximizing educational spending effectiveness, neglecting the broader societal benefits we champion: maximizing societal benefit. A policy\u2019s true value lies in its holistic impact on society, considering not only educational outcomes but also factors like reduced healthcare costs due to preventative care and improved long-term health outcomes [1], increased social mobility through better access to opportunities [2], and stronger community bonds through shared early childhood experiences.\n\nFirst, the negative side argues that \u201cuniversal preschool spreads limited resources thinly across all families, regardless of need.\u201d However, this argument presents a false dichotomy. Universal preschool and targeted programs are not mutually exclusive. Funding can, and should, be allocated to both, creating a synergistic approach that maximizes benefits. Research by Barnett and Haskins [3] supports the effectiveness of combining universal access with targeted support for children with greater needs. This dual approach yields greater overall positive impacts than either method individually. Moreover, universal preschool offers long-term societal benefits, such as increased workforce participation [4], which targeted interventions alone may not achieve. We must consider the broader picture of societal gain, not just immediate educational spending.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that \u201cgovernment-funded preschool creates an artificial demand, allowing private institutions to inflate tuition.\u201d  However, this argument misrepresents the complex dynamics of the preschool market.  Tuition increases are influenced by multiple factors like inflation and rising operational costs for all providers, not solely by subsidies.  Furthermore, subsidies significantly increase affordability for low-income families, enabling them to access quality preschool, an opportunity they might otherwise miss [5]. While managing potential cost increases is a valid concern, the claim that subsidies *solely* drive tuition inflation overlooks crucial factors and their importance in expanding access. Subsidies can even incentivize the creation of more affordable preschool options by stimulating competition.  By providing funding, the government effectively lowers the barrier to entry for new providers, particularly those focused on serving lower-income families.  This increased competition can pressure existing providers to moderate their price increases and offer more competitive rates, ultimately benefiting families.\n\nThird, the negative team asserts that universal preschool would create an insurmountable administrative burden, arguing that \u201cScaling this program for universal preschool would exacerbate these challenges, requiring more staff, resources, and complex systems.\u201d This argument assumes an inefficient expansion of the bureaucracy, which isn\u2019t necessarily the case. A well-planned expansion, leveraging existing infrastructure and streamlining processes, can minimize administrative burden.  For instance, successful programs like Head Start [7] demonstrate how effective management and targeted allocation of resources can mitigate administrative challenges in large-scale early childhood programs. While acknowledging administrative costs, we argue that these are dwarfed by the long-term economic benefits of a more educated workforce and reduced social service costs [6]\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heckman, J.

      "content": "Friends, judges, and esteemed audience, our opponents paint a rosy picture of universal preschool, but their arguments fail to address the fundamental flaws we\u2019ve highlighted. They advocate for maximizing societal benefit, a broad and subjective measure, while we focus on maximizing the effectiveness of educational spending, a concrete and measurable goal.  This difference in approach is crucial to understanding the true impact of universal preschool.\n\nLet's revisit the issue of resource allocation. Our opponents suggest a synergistic approach, combining universal preschool with targeted interventions.  However, this ideal scenario overlooks the reality of limited resources. As the RAND study [1] demonstrates, targeted interventions for disadvantaged children yield significant benefits.  Conversely, the long-term benefits of universal pre-K are less clear, with some studies suggesting academic gains fade over time [2].  Furthermore, the pressure on private preschools from free public options [3, 4] could lead to a decline in quality, impacting families who choose non-public options. This undercuts the overall societal benefit they claim.\n\nNext, let's address tuition costs. Our opponents argue that multiple factors contribute to rising tuition, but they fail to acknowledge the inflationary pressure of government subsidies. Evidence shows increased government spending coincides with rising tuition [5]. Subsidies, while increasing access for some, create artificial demand, allowing private providers to raise prices.  This disproportionately harms middle-class families who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies but face increased market rates.  Think about it\u2014if you're a middle-class family, you\u2019re stuck paying higher prices without the benefit of subsidies.\n\nRegarding administrative burden, our opponents claim a well-planned expansion can minimize the burden.  This is simply wishful thinking.  Any expansion, regardless of planning, inherently increases administrative needs. Remember, administrative costs already consume 15-20% of preschool expenses [6]. This cost will inevitably grow with program expansion.  As states increase preschool funding, they experience increased enrollment and, consequently, greater administrative demands [7].  More children mean more resources required for enrollment, oversight, and compliance.  The notion that this burden can be minimized is unrealistic.\n\nMoreover, universal preschool creates competition for resources with other pressing educational needs.  The Penn Wharton study [8] highlighted the substantial costs and potentially negative economic impacts of universal programs.  These funds could be better used to address pressing issues like the learning crisis exacerbated by COVID-19 [9] or inadequate teacher pay [10].  Imagine if those funds went towards supporting struggling students or attracting better teachers\u2014the potential positive impact on education is undeniable.\n\nFurthermore, government-funded preschool discourages private investment in early childhood education. By offering \"free\" alternatives, it creates a \"crowd-out\" effect, displacing private investment [11]. This limits innovation and choice in the preschool market, ultimately harming the diversity and quality of early childhood education.\n\nFinally, consider the unintended social consequences.  Studies reveal negative impacts of public pre-K on academic and behavioral outcomes [12, 13].  The pressure to conform to standardized curriculums [14] increases parental stress.  Parents may feel forced to supplement their child's education due to suboptimal learning experiences, adding extra costs and time commitments.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n[2] Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good\n[3] The Controversy of Universal Preschool and How It Affects Childcare ... https://www.daycarestudio.net/home/the-controversy-of-universal-preschool-and-how-it-affects-childcare-providers\n[4] Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses ... - KQED. https://www.kqed.org/news/11893791/why-californias-universal-transitional-kindergarten-plan-poses-a-threat-to-some-early-childhood-ed-providers\n[5] Economic Effects of Expanding Subsidized Child Care and Providing ... https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57630\n[6] What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates. https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool\n[7] Resources to Support Preschool Expansion and Early School Success. https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/resources-support-preschool-expansion-and-early-school-success\n[8] Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/\n[9] Four of the biggest problems facing education\u2014and four trends that ... https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/four-biggest-problems-facing-education-and-four-trends-could-make-difference\n[10] 7 Education Policy Issues That Need to Be Solved in 2020. https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/education-policy-issues-in-2020/\n[11] More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ... https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy\n[12] Universal Preschool Programs Expand, Despite Documented Harms. https://fee.org/articles/universal-preschool-programs-expand-despite-documented-harms/\n[13] Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good\n[14] Universal Preschool Cookie-Cutter Pressure: Head Start's Troubling ... https://nancyebailey.com/2021/11/13/universal-preschool-cookie-cutter-pressure-head-starts-troubling-framework/\n"

The negative team argues for targeted interventions, claiming universal pre-K is inefficient. We contend this is a false choice.  We can, and should, do both. Research shows combining universal access with targeted support maximizes positive impact [3].  Furthermore, universal pre-K offers unique long-term societal benefits, like increased social mobility [2] and a stronger workforce [9], advantages targeted programs alone cannot achieve.  Concerning their argument about declining private preschool quality, quality control measures like mandatory accreditation and regular inspections would ensure standards are maintained across all providers, public and private.\n\nOur opponents also claim subsidies artificially inflate tuition.  This ignores the reality that multiple factors, including rising operational costs and inflation, contribute to tuition increases. Subsidies, however, directly address affordability for low-income families [5], enabling access to quality preschool otherwise unattainable.  Furthermore, subsidies can stimulate competition.  To mitigate potential cost increases, we propose tying subsidy amounts to a sliding scale based on provider quality ratings and operating costs, incentivizing both affordability and high standards.  This market-based approach promotes value and efficiency.\n\nThe negative team's argument against government funding discouraging private investment is unfounded.

A more effective strategy is to allocate funding to programs specifically designed to address the unique needs of disadvantaged children, rather than diluting the impact through universal subsidies.

Excerpts from the brief: The debate over universal vs. targeted preschool programs is explored in this policy brief. While targeted programs traditionally have lower costs, universal programs are more effective at reaching all targeted children. And while the academic achievement gap is most dramatic between children in poverty and those with the most resources, school readiness is not just a problem of the poor. School readiness for the majority of children can improve with better preschool education. Policy Recommendations: - The effectiveness and efficiency of investments in preschool could be increased with a shift from targeted to voluntary universal preschool programs. - High quality standards for all children are required for effective universal preschool programs. - Children with special needs due to poverty or disabilities may require more intensive services within universal programs. - Expansion toward universal takes time, and patience is required to build capacity while maintaining or improving quality. - Preschool programs could move toward universal access by gradually raising thresholds for eligibility. - Federal matching funds could be used to encourage states to fund high-quality preschool for all. 32 Heath St W.

The common response to this vote is that it is a tragedy. It isn't. A proposal to restore the lower interest rate of 3.4 percent on student loans from its recently increased 6.8 percent for another year failed in the Senate on Wednesday. The common response to this vote is that it is a tragedy. It isn't. First, even the 6.8 percent rate, students are still benefiting from a significant subsidy; the rate on similar loans that students obtain in the private market is about 12 percent. Second, extending the lower rate would be reckless since it would continue to artificially inflate the student loan bubble. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that over the past decade, student loan debt has increased by 281 percent, from about $260 billion in the first quarter of 2004 to $990 billion in the first quarter of 2013 and is now higher than the country's collective credit card debt. In the past year alone, student loans debt has increased by $20 billion. In addition, by keeping student loan rates artificially low, the federal government is contributing to the rapid i",

Furthermore, the increased demand may not reflect a genuine need for preschool but rather a reaction to its subsidized availability.

President Obama and other proponents of taxpayer-funded universal preschool want to add $10 billion as an incentive for the states to expand their early childhood education and care programs -- with the goal of giving all children access to state-subsidized preschool.

The common response to this vote is that it is a tragedy. It isn't. A proposal to restore the lower interest rate of 3.4 percent on student loans from its recently increased 6.8 percent for another year failed in the Senate on Wednesday. The common response to this vote is that it is a tragedy. It isn't. First, even the 6.8 percent rate, students are still benefiting from a significant subsidy; the rate on similar loans that students obtain in the private market is about 12 percent. Second, extending the lower rate would be reckless since it would continue to artificially inflate the student loan bubble. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that over the past decade, student loan debt has increased by 281 percent, from about $260 billion in the first quarter of 2004 to $990 billion in the first quarter of 2013 and is now higher than the country's collective credit card debt. In the past year alone, student loans debt has increased by $20 billion. In addition, by keeping student loan rates artificially low, the federal government is contributing to the rapid i",

Dills Rey Hernandez-Julian Nathan Hale Download Publication Summary PDF Download PDF Tuition and fees for higher education have increased at a rate much higher than inflation over the past 40 years. Although the amount students pay has risen much less than listed tuition, net price also continues to increase faster than inflation. Taxpayer funded subsidies to higher education have also increased substantially during this period. The Bennett hypothesis states that tuition will increase in response to subsidies. We review the variety of government programs subsidizing higher education and summarize the existing evidence on the Bennett hypothesis. The evidence on the Bennett hypothesis remains mixed, providing some evidence that the effectiveness of the subsidies in increasing college enrollment is diminished to the degree that taxpayer moneys are diverted to the institutions of higher education. Listed tuition\u2014essentially the sticker price\u2014for US colleges has increased significantly, even after adjusting for inflation. For all institutions of higher education, that increase averages 71 percent since 1990 and 36 percent since 2000.1 Tuition has increased faster in public, four-year institutions, where the increase has averaged 126 per",

                "argument": "A key study from the Heritage Foundation (2_25) directly addresses the unintended consequence of government-subsidized preschool: the artificial inflation of tuition.  The study explains how government-funded preschools undercut private providers, creating a demand driven by subsidies rather than actual market needs.  This allows private institutions to elevate tuition costs, as they are no longer solely competing on price and quality within a free market. The subsidized \"free\" option distorts the market, giving private preschools leeway to inflate prices. Moreover, the PWBM study (2_4) reveals how government intervention in education, through subsidies and funding, can lead to significant increases in costs, mirroring the trend we're discussing in preschool. The study concludes that increased costs associated with such programs are often financed through debt, further burdening taxpayers. The combined effect of artificially inflated demand and increased costs demonstrates how subsidies ultimately lead to higher tuition, impacting both families and the economy as a whole. While some might argue subsidies increase access, they fail to address underlying affordability issues and instead create market distortions. This supports the conclusion that government-subsidized preschool ultimately inflates tuition costs due to artificial demand.",

President Obama and other proponents of taxpayer-funded universal preschool want to add $10 billion as an incentive for the states to expand their early childhood education and care programs -- with the goal of giving all children access to state-subsidized preschool.

These interventions often offer higher returns on investment compared to universal programs by focusing resources on those most in need. Subsidizing universal preschool risks diverting funds from these more effective, targeted approaches, ultimately hindering overall educational progress.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Government-subsidized preschool creates an artificial demand, leading to inflated tuition costs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_4', 'query': 'The impact of government subsidies on preschool tuition costs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '2_25', 'query': 'The economics of government-funded preschool and its effect on private preschools', 'title': 'More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ...', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy'}]\n**Long Argument**: A key study from the Heritage Foundation (2_25) directly addresses the unintended consequence of government-subsidized preschool: the artificial inflation of tuition.  The study explains how government-funded preschools undercut private providers, creating a demand driven by subsidies rather than actual market needs.  This allows private institutions to elevate tuition costs, as they are no longer solely competing on price and quality within a free market. The subsidized \"free\" option distorts the market, giving private preschools leeway to inflate prices. Moreover, the PWBM study (2_4) reveals how government intervention in education, through subsidies and funding, can lead to significant increases in costs, mirroring the trend we're discussing in preschool. The study concludes that increased costs associated with such programs are often financed through debt, further burdening taxpayers. The combined effect of artificially inflated demand and increased costs demonstrates how subsidies ultimately lead to higher tuition, impacting both families and the economy as a whole. While some might argue subsidies increase access, they fail to address underlying affordability issues and instead create market distortions. This supports the conclusion that government-subsidized preschool ultimately inflates tuition costs due to artificial demand.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Subsidizing preschool creates a larger government bureaucracy, increasing administrative costs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '7_8', 'query': 'Cost of administering government preschool programs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '7_12', 'query': 'Bureaucratic overhead of public preschool programs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '7_35', 'query': 'Administrative costs of public preschool as a percentage of total costs', 'title': 'What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates', 'url': 'https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool'}, {'id': '7_40', 'query': 'Administrative burden of CCDF program on preschool providers', 'title': 'Improving Child Care Access, Affordability, and Stability in the Child ...', 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/01/2024-04139/improving-child-care-access-affordability-and-stability-in-the-child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf'}, {'id': '7_43', 'query': 'Administrative burden of CCDF program on preschool providers', 'title': 'Keeping kids in care: Reducing administrative burden in state Child ...', 'url': 'https://researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/148536'}]\n**Long Argument**: Studies show that the administrative burden of public preschool programs is substantial and grows with program expansion.

Scaling this program to accommodate universal preschool would dramatically increase the need for administrative staff, resources, and complex systems to handle the influx of applications and ensure proper allocation of funds.

Furthermore, as administrative expenses often consume 15% to 20% of total operating costs (\"7_35\"), the potential for significant financial strain on the system is evident.

Our opponents have presented a vision of universal preschool as a panacea for societal ills, but we believe this vision is clouded by well-intentioned but ultimately misguided policy.  We contend that universal preschool subsidies are not only inefficient but also counterproductive, leading to unintended consequences that harm the very families and children they intend to help.\n\nOur judging criteria for this debate is maximizing the effectiveness of educational spending.  We believe that every dollar invested in education should yield the greatest possible return in terms of improved outcomes for children.  This framework is crucial because it prioritizes demonstrable results and responsible stewardship of public funds.\n\nFirst, let's address the misallocation of resources. While universal preschool sounds appealing, it spreads limited resources thinly across all families, regardless of need. Studies on targeted interventions for disadvantaged children, such as the Chicago Child-Parent Centers [1, 2], demonstrate significantly higher returns on investment.  These programs focus resources on those who benefit most, leading to substantial improvements in educational outcomes. By diverting funds towards universal preschool, we risk shortchanging these proven, targeted interventions and hindering overall educational progress.  We must prioritize effectiveness, not just broad access.\n\nNow, consider the impact on tuition costs.  Our opponents argue that subsidies make preschool more affordable.  However, a key study from the Heritage Foundation [3] shows that government-funded preschool creates an artificial demand, allowing private institutions to inflate tuition.  This is because government-funded preschools undercut private providers, creating a demand driven by subsidies, not actual market needs. This gives private preschools the opportunity to raise prices, as they are no longer solely competing on price and quality. As highlighted in the Penn Wharton Budget Model study [4], government intervention through subsidies and funding can lead to cost increases. This model shows increased costs linked to such programs are often financed through debt, burdening taxpayers. The combined effect of artificial demand and increased costs demonstrates how subsidies lead to higher tuition, impacting families and the broader economy. Subsidies may appear to increase access but fail to address underlying affordability issues and instead distort the market. This underscores how government-subsidized preschool inflates tuition due to artificial demand.\n\nFinally, let's examine the administrative burden. Expanding preschool programs necessitates a larger government bureaucracy to manage the influx of applications, allocate funds, and ensure compliance.  Research on the Child Care and Development Fund program [5, 6] reveals the existing administrative challenges. Scaling this program for universal preschool would exacerbate these challenges, requiring more staff, resources, and complex systems. This would divert resources away from educational services and negate the program's intended benefits. The Penn Wharton Budget Model study [4] projects increased government debt from such programs, partly due to higher administrative spending.  Considering that administrative expenses often consume 15% to 20% of total operating costs [7], the potential for significant financial strain is evident. While proponents tout long-term economic benefits, the immediate increase in bureaucratic overhead poses a considerable fiscal challenge.  We believe in responsible spending and maximizing the impact of each educational dollar.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Early Childhood Interventions: Benefits, Costs, and Savings. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB5014.html\n\n[2] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n\n[3] More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ... https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy\n\n[4] Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/\n\n[5] Improving Child Care Access, Affordability, and Stability in the Child ... https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/01/2024-04139/improving-child-care-access-affordability-and-stability-in-the-child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf\n\n[6] Keeping kids in care: Reducing administrative burden in state Child ... https://researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/148536\n\n[7] What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates. https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool\n",

        "statements": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, specifically regarding resource allocation, tuition costs, and administrative burden. They operate under a narrow framework of maximizing educational spending effectiveness, neglecting the broader societal benefits we champion: maximizing societal benefit. A policy\u2019s true value lies in its holistic impact on society, considering not only educational outcomes but also factors like reduced healthcare costs due to preventative care and improved long-term health outcomes [1], increased social mobility through better access to opportunities [2], and stronger community bonds through shared early childhood experiences.\n\nFirst, the negative side argues that \u201cuniversal preschool spreads limited resources thinly across all families, regardless of need.\u201d However, this argument presents a false dichotomy. Universal preschool and targeted programs are not mutually exclusive. Funding can, and should, be allocated to both, creating a synergistic approach that maximizes benefits. Research by Barnett and Haskins [3] supports the effectiveness of combining universal access with targeted support for children with greater needs. This dual approach yields greater overall positive impacts than either method individually. Moreover, universal preschool offers long-term societal benefits, such as increased workforce participation [4], which targeted interventions alone may not achieve. We must consider the broader picture of societal gain, not just immediate educational spending.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that \u201cgovernment-funded preschool creates an artificial demand, allowing private institutions to inflate tuition.\u201d  However, this argument misrepresents the complex dynamics of the preschool market.  Tuition increases are influenced by multiple factors like inflation and rising operational costs for all providers, not solely by subsidies.  Furthermore, subsidies significantly increase affordability for low-income families, enabling them to access quality preschool, an opportunity they might otherwise miss [5]. While managing potential cost increases is a valid concern, the claim that subsidies *solely* drive tuition inflation overlooks crucial factors and their importance in expanding access. Subsidies can even incentivize the creation of more affordable preschool options by stimulating competition.  By providing funding, the government effectively lowers the barrier to entry for new providers, particularly those focused on serving lower-income families.  This increased competition can pressure existing providers to moderate their price increases and offer more competitive rates, ultimately benefiting families.\n\nThird, the negative team asserts that universal preschool would create an insurmountable administrative burden, arguing that \u201cScaling this program for universal preschool would exacerbate these challenges, requiring more staff, resources, and complex systems.\u201d This argument assumes an inefficient expansion of the bureaucracy, which isn\u2019t necessarily the case. A well-planned expansion, leveraging existing infrastructure and streamlining processes, can minimize administrative burden.  For instance, successful programs like Head Start [7] demonstrate how effective management and targeted allocation of resources can mitigate administrative challenges in large-scale early childhood programs. While acknowledging administrative costs, we argue that these are dwarfed by the long-term economic benefits of a more educated workforce and reduced social service costs [6]\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heckman, J.

Nearly all government programs restrict eligibility to children in low-income families, and these families have substantially increased preschool participation rates as a result. However, in the last decade little progress was made toward increasing enrollments, despite increases in government spending, and less than half of children in poverty attend public programs even at age four. The average educational quality of private programs is quite low, and public programs are only modestly better. As a result, the educational effectiveness of preschool programs in the United States tends to be much weaker than that of the well-known programs research has shown be cost-effective.

On the one hand, some argue that universal preschool should be offered to all children to give them a head start in their education.

Let's dive into this topic and discuss the pros and cons of universal pre-k and how child care providers can navigate the change and ensure that their programs are not negatively impacted. So what is universal preschool? Universal preschool is a publicly funded program that provides free or low-cost preschool to all children turning 4 before a specific date in the academic calendar. Some states also serve three-year-olds. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), \"Universal pre-K means that pre-K programs are available to any child in a given state, regardless of family income, children's abilities, or other factors.\" Pros of Universal Preschool Teachers are highly qualified and must have a degree in early childhood education All children can attend States fund the program Preschool helps children develop critical social skills and sets the foundation for future learning Cons of Universal Pre-K Childcare centers, private preschools, and in-home providers lose enrollment causing financial strain Expense for states Some quality ECE teachers in child care centers may swap to the public school system How Can Childcare Providers Survive the Change?

Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses a Threat to Some Early Childhood Ed Providers Please try again Universal preschool is coming to California in 2025, a major victory, years in the making for early childhood education advocates. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest thing we\u2019ve ever done in California for our youngest learners,\u201d said Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, a Sacramento Democrat who led the push for universal preschool in California during the last decade. McCarty is the architect of the $2.7 billion initiative, which was authorized as part of an education funding bill signed into law in July. The program, called universal transitional kindergarten, will be gradually phased in over the next five years on public school campuses, expanding existing TK classrooms until it covers all 4-year-olds in the state. By the 2025-26 school year, at full implementation, the program is expected to benefit 300,000 children, according to McCarty\u2019s office. \u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d McCarty said. But Makinya Ward is not celebrating. As a new mother, the San Leandro resident struggled to find quality preschool for her children. She wanted them to grow and develop through play, and also be nurtured by caring teachers. When she couldn\u2019t find a suitable child care center, Ward started her own in 2009. Bri Davis helps",

A 2015 Vanderbilt study of Tennessee's universal preschool program reveals notable downsides (\"9_7\"). This large-scale, randomized controlled trial found that children who attended the program performed worse academically by sixth grade than their peers who didn't attend.  This suggests that universal preschool, rather than producing clear long-term academic benefits, may even harm some children's educational development.  Additionally, implementing universal preschool creates financial strain on private providers (\"4_0\"). This can force the closure of private centers, reducing overall childcare availability, which reduces parental choice and creates difficulty for parents seeking specific educational approaches or flexible hours.  Therefore, while targeted interventions, like those highlighted by RAND (\"0_7\"), demonstrate positive results, the potential negative impacts and inconclusive long-term benefits of universal pre-K indicate that solely focusing resources on targeted programs is a more prudent approach to maximizing societal benefit.",

All of today\u2019s pressing education policy issues relate directly to fulfilling educators\u2019 mission to provide students with the most effective teaching possible. As the pandemic rages, that mission becomes more important than ever. Educators\u2019 short-term focus is on establishing distance learning procedures that serve all students. However, the long-term impact of the pandemic remains unclear. Issues related to school funding, teacher training and retention, workforce development, and providing safe and welcoming education environments are too important to be shunted aside as the world focuses on combating the coronavirus. The times of greatest challenge can also be the times of greatest opportunity for effecting lasting, positive change. Educators and education leaders must face this catastrophe head-on and prepare to reimagine how communities can best serve the education needs of their children. #1: Education\u2019s Response to the Coronavirus The initial response to the shift from classroom instruction to distance learning has highlighted the disparity in online access that threatens to widen the digital divide between rich and poor students. The Associated Press reports that 17 percent of US students do not have access to computers at home, and 18 percent do not have broadband internet access from their homes. The problem extends beyond ensuring students have the necessary computers and internet access. Even when students have access to online learning resources via internet-connected devices, family circumstances may hinder their ability to complete coursework remotely.

We focused on neuroscience, the role of the private sector, education technology, inequality, and pedagogy. Unfortunately, we think the four biggest problems facing education today in developing countries are the same ones we have identified in the last decades. 1. The learning crisis was made worse by COVID-19 school closures Low quality instruction is a major constraint and prior to COVID-19, the learning poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries was 57% (6 out of 10 children could not read and understand basic texts by age 10). More dramatic is the case of Sub-Saharan Africa with a rate even higher at 86%. Several analyses show that the impact of the pandemic on student learning was significant, leaving students in low- and middle-income countries way behind in mathematics, reading and other subjects.\u00a0 Some argue that learning poverty may be close to 70% after the pandemic, with a substantial long-term negative effect in future earnings. This generation could lose around $21 trillion in future salaries, with the vulnerable students affected the most. 2. Countries are not paying enough attention to early childhood care and education (ECCE) At the pre-school level about two-thirds of countries do not have a proper legal framework to provide free and compulsory pre-primary education. According to UNESCO, only a minority of countries, mostly high-income, were making timely progress towards SDG4 benchmarks on early childhood indicators prior to the onset of COVID-19. And remember that ECCE is not only preparation for primary school. It can be the foundation for emotional wellbeing and learning throughout life; ",

All of today\u2019s pressing education policy issues relate directly to fulfilling educators\u2019 mission to provide students with the most effective teaching possible. As the pandemic rages, that mission becomes more important than ever. Educators\u2019 short-term focus is on establishing distance learning procedures that serve all students. However, the long-term impact of the pandemic remains unclear. Issues related to school funding, teacher training and retention, workforce development, and providing safe and welcoming education environments are too important to be shunted aside as the world focuses on combating the coronavirus. The times of greatest challenge can also be the times of greatest opportunity for effecting lasting, positive change. Educators and education leaders must face this catastrophe head-on and prepare to reimagine how communities can best serve the education needs of their children. #1: Education\u2019s Response to the Coronavirus The initial response to the shift from classroom instruction to distance learning has highlighted the disparity in online access that threatens to widen the digital divide between rich and poor students. The Associated Press reports that 17 percent of US students do not have access to computers at home, and 18 percent do not have broadband internet access from their homes. The problem extends beyond ensuring students have the necessary computers and internet access. Even when students have access to online learning resources via internet-connected devices, family circumstances may hinder their ability to complete coursework remotely. The New York Times recounts the experiences of students in the same political science class at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. One student was able to log into the videoconferencing app the college relied on for its online classes from her parent\u2019s vacation home in Maine, while another had",

This generation could lose around $21 trillion in future salaries, with the vulnerable students affected the most. 2. Countries are not paying enough attention to early childhood care and education (ECCE) At the pre-school level about two-thirds of countries do not have a proper legal framework to provide free and compulsory pre-primary education. According to UNESCO, only a minority of countries, mostly high-income, were making timely progress towards SDG4 benchmarks on early childhood indicators prior to the onset of COVID-19.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

Since Georgia used a voucher-like program and Oklahoma utilized its existing public schools, the two states offer a case study of how government provision compares to government subsidization alone. Using a synthetic control group difference-in-difference estimation framework, we examine the effects of universal preschool on childcare providers. In both states there is an increase in the number of formal childcare centers. With the voucher-like program in Georgia, the overall increase in care is partly driven by an increase in the supply of formal childcare in the private sector and partly driven by new publicly-provided preschools. However, there is substantial crowd-out of private consumption of preschool. In Oklahoma, where universal preschool is publicly provided, the increase in the number of childcare providers occurred only in the public sector. The expansion of publicly-provided care seems to be driven largely by movement of employees from private centers to public settings. As such, this case-study comparison suggests that government subsidization through funding was more effec",

While other factors contribute, government subsidies play a significant role. The Congressional Budget Office, analyzing H.R. 5376 (Build Back Better Act) which expands subsidies and provides universal preschool, projects a substantial increase in federal deficits (\"2_0\"). This massive influx of government funds inevitably increases demand. Basic economics dictates that when demand increases without a corresponding supply increase, prices rise. This is reflected in private preschool tuition, where providers respond to market forces.  While the claim argues other factors influence tuition, this doesn't negate the inflationary pressure from subsidies. This ultimately harms middle-class families priced out of the market. They don't qualify for subsidies and bear the brunt of rising tuition caused, in part, by government intervention. The study doesn't isolate the impact of subsidies from other factors, but the clear correlation between increased spending and rising tuition is undeniable.",

Those policies would affect child care workers (including teachers) and families with children. Summary H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law. On average, parents\u2019 employment would probably increase slightly under both programs. This document does not examine effects that would arise from how the programs were financed.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

From that perspective it makes little sense to provide the same universal access to preschool programs as to K-12 education. The view of preschool as welfare influences the way preschool education is financed and helps explain why the US doesn\u2019t offer every child a quality preschool education. Preschool funding is much more heavily dependent on a patchwork of federal programs \u2014 a tradition more reflective of social insurance programs than public education, which is primarily a state and local responsibility. As a result in most states preschool programs including Head Start and subsidized child care target only the most vulnerable young children \u2014 a noble goal for sure, but even these programs fail to reach most of the intended beneficiaries and funding levels are far from adequate for a quality early education. If the US public was more convinced of the educational value of pre-K, would we see more state and local financial resources being invested? It seems likely. Most states do provide some funding for preschool and child care, but local funding is much less common. By contrast, 45% of public K-12 education comes from local taxes, the large majority from property tax receipts. State resources account for another 47% of spending. The rest \u2014 just 8% \u2014 is filled by federal funds. If the local share for early childhood programs were equal to that for K-12, funding for state pre-K programs would just about double. Taking a broader view including Head Start and state funded pre-K, just over half of the dollars come from federal government financing (51%), with states providing 39% and just 9% deriving from local sources.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education.

In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) currently enrolls over 6000 preschool students as part of their tuition-free universal pre-K initiative, and reports that more than 92% of these students are \u201cmeeting or exceeding developmental expectations.\u201d DCPS requires that preschool teachers hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and teachers are paid a salary comparable to that of K-12 teachers.

Common sense should tell us that. ~Dr. Peter Gray, The Case Against Preschool in Psychology Today. Universal preschool might better be called daycare, a program for young children to socialize, have free play, and experience lovely learning-rich experiences before school. It might help parents who\u2019ve had a difficult time during the pandemic. But the term school needs examining along with its association to Head Start\u2019s standards. President Biden has said: Research shows when a young child goes to school, not daycare, they\u2019re far more likely to graduate from high school, and go to college or something after high school. This standardization worries a lot of early childhood experts who believe daycare is a better term. It also seems likely that universal preschool might emulate Head Start, a preschool program started under the Johnson administration in 1965 to lift poor children out of poverty.

Nearly all government programs restrict eligibility to children in low-income families, and these families have substantially increased preschool participation rates as a result. However, in the last decade little progress was made toward increasing enrollments, despite increases in government spending, and less than half of children in poverty attend public programs even at age four. The average educational quality of private programs is quite low, and public programs are only modestly better. As a result, the educational effectiveness of preschool programs in the United States tends to be much weaker than that of the well-known programs research has shown be cost-effective. This paper considers whether publicly funded preschool education for all children would alleviate these problems. Universal public preschool education wo...

While targeted programs traditionally have lower costs, universal programs are more effective at reaching all targeted children. And while the academic achievement gap is most dramatic between children in poverty and those with the most resources, school readiness is not just a problem of the poor. School readiness for the majority of children can improve with better preschool education. Policy Recommendations: - The effectiveness and efficiency of investments in preschool could be increased with a shift from targeted to voluntary universal preschool programs. - High quality standards for all children are required for effective universal preschool programs. - Children with special needs due to poverty or disabilities may require more intensive services within universal programs. - Expansion toward universal takes time, and patience is required to build capacity while maintaining or improving quality. - Preschool programs could move toward universal access by gradually raising thresholds for eligibility. - Federal matching funds could be used to encourage states to fund high-quality preschool for all. 32 Heath St W.

Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses a Threat to Some Early Childhood Ed Providers Please try again Universal preschool is coming to California in 2025, a major victory, years in the making for early childhood education advocates. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest thing we\u2019ve ever done in California for our youngest learners,\u201d said Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, a Sacramento Democrat who led the push for universal preschool in California during the last decade. McCarty is the architect of the $2.7 billion initiative, which was authorized as part of an education funding bill signed into law in July. The program, called universal transitional kindergarten, will be gradually phased in over the next five years on public school campuses, expanding existing TK classrooms until it covers all 4-year-olds in the state. By the 2025-26 school year, at full implementation, the program is expected to benefit 300,000 children, according to McCarty\u2019s office. \u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d McCarty said. But Makinya Ward is not celebrating. As a new mother, the San Leandro resident struggled to find quality preschool for her children. She wanted them to grow and develop through play, and also be nurtured by caring teachers. When she couldn\u2019t find a suitable child care center, Ward started her own in 2009. Bri Davis helps",

A 2015 Vanderbilt study of Tennessee's universal preschool program reveals notable downsides (\"9_7\"). This large-scale, randomized controlled trial found that children who attended the program performed worse academically by sixth grade than their peers who didn't attend.  This suggests that universal preschool, rather than producing clear long-term academic benefits, may even harm some children's educational development.  Additionally, implementing universal preschool creates financial strain on private providers (\"4_0\"). This can force the closure of private centers, reducing overall childcare availability, which reduces parental choice and creates difficulty for parents seeking specific educational approaches or flexible hours.  Therefore, while targeted interventions, like those highlighted by RAND (\"0_7\"), demonstrate positive results, the potential negative impacts and inconclusive long-term benefits of universal pre-K indicate that solely focusing resources on targeted programs is a more prudent approach to maximizing societal benefit.",

Now, let\u2019s talk about universal pre-k. There is much debate surrounding universal preschool and its effects on childcare providers. On the one hand, some argue that universal preschool should be offered to all children to give them a head start in their education. On the other hand, many childcare providers in early childhood education feel that their child enrollment and business will suffer if universal pre-k is implemented. Let's dive into this topic and discuss the pros and cons of universal pre-k and how child care providers can navigate the change and ensure that their programs are not negatively impacted. So what is universal preschool? Universal preschool is a publicly funded program that provides free or low-cost preschool to all children turning 4 before a specific date in the academic calendar. Some states also serve three-year-olds. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), \"Universal pre-K means that pre-K programs are available to any child in a given state, regardless of family income, children's abilities, or other factors.\" Pros of Universal Preschool Teachers are highly qualified and must have a degree in early childhood education All children can attend States fund the program Preschool helps children develop critical social skills and sets the foundation for future learning Cons of Universal Pre-K Childcare centers, private preschools, and in-home providers lose enrollment causing financial strain Expense for states Some quality ECE teachers in child care centers may swap to the public school system How Can Childcare Providers Survive the Change? Do your research and know the program. If universal pre-K is implemented in your state, it is essential to do your research and understand how the program will work. Th",

The learning crisis was made worse by COVID-19 school closures Low quality instruction is a major constraint and prior to COVID-19, the learning poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries was 57% (6 out of 10 children could not read and understand basic texts by age 10). More dramatic is the case of Sub-Saharan Africa with a rate even higher at 86%. Several analyses show that the impact of the pandemic on student learning was significant, leaving students in low- and middle-income countries way behind in mathematics, reading and other subjects.\u00a0 Some argue that learning poverty may be close to 70% after the pandemic, with a substantial long-term negative effect in future earnings. This generation could lose around $21 trillion in future salaries, with the vulnerable students affected the most. 2. Countries are not paying enough attention to early childhood care and education (ECCE) At the pre-school level about two-thirds of countries do not have a proper legal framework to provide free and compulsory pre-primary education. According to UNESCO, only a minority of countries, mostly high-income, were making timely progress towards SDG4 benchmarks on early childhood indicators prior to the onset of COVID-19.

We focused on neuroscience, the role of the private sector, education technology, inequality, and pedagogy. Unfortunately, we think the four biggest problems facing education today in developing countries are the same ones we have identified in the last decades. 1. The learning crisis was made worse by COVID-19 school closures Low quality instruction is a major constraint and prior to COVID-19, the learning poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries was 57% (6 out of 10 children could not read and understand basic texts by age 10). More dramatic is the case of Sub-Saharan Africa with a rate even higher at 86%. Several analyses show that the impact of the pandemic on student learning was significant, leaving students in low- and middle-income countries way behind in mathematics, reading and other subjects.\u00a0 Some argue that learning poverty may be close to 70% after the pandemic, with a substantial long-term negative effect in future earnings. This generation could lose around $21 trillion in future salaries, with the vulnerable students affected the most. 2. Countries are not paying enough attention to early childhood care and education (ECCE) At the pre-school level about two-thirds of countries do not have a proper legal framework to provide free and compulsory pre-primary education. According to UNESCO, only a minority of countries, mostly high-income, were making timely progress towards SDG4 benchmarks on early childhood indicators prior to the onset of COVID-19. And remember that ECCE is not only preparation for primary school. It can be the foundation for emotional wellbeing and learning throughout life; ",

Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle.

The Congressional Budget Office, analyzing H.R. 5376 (Build Back Better Act) which expands subsidies and provides universal preschool, projects a substantial increase in federal deficits (\"2_0\"). This massive influx of government funds inevitably increases demand. Basic economics dictates that when demand increases without a corresponding supply increase, prices rise. This is reflected in private preschool tuition, where providers respond to market forces.  While the claim argues other factors influence tuition, this doesn't negate the inflationary pressure from subsidies. This ultimately harms middle-class families priced out of the market. They don't qualify for subsidies and bear the brunt of rising tuition caused, in part, by government intervention.

                    "raw_content": "Why the Source of Preschool Funding Matters September 2, 2016 Richard Kasmin While research demonstrates the educational, economic, and social benefits of quality preschool, a portion of the public continues to see early learning as a social welfare program \u2014 babysitting for the poor \u2014 rather than education. From that perspective it makes little sense to provide the same universal access to preschool programs as to K-12 education. The view of preschool as welfare influences the way preschool education is financed and helps explain why the US doesn\u2019t offer every child a quality preschool education. Preschool funding is much more heavily dependent on a patchwork of federal programs \u2014 a tradition more reflective of social insurance programs than public education, which is primarily a state and local responsibility. As a result in most states preschool programs including Head Start and subsidized child care target only the most vulnerable young children \u2014 a noble goal for sure, but even these programs fail to reach most of the intended beneficiaries and funding levels are far from adequate for a quality early education. If the US public was more convinced of the educational value of pre-K, would we see more state and local financial resources being invested? It seems likely. Most states do provide some funding for preschool and child care, but local funding is much less common. By contrast, 45% of public K-12 education comes from local taxes, the large majority from property tax receipts. State resources account for another 47% of spending. The rest \u2014 just 8% \u2014 is filled by federal funds. If the local share for early childhood programs were equal to that for K-12, funding for state pre-K programs would just about double. Taking a broader view including Head Start and state funded pre-K, just over half of the dollars come from federal government financing (51%), with states providing 39% and just 9% deriving from local sources. With a few notable exceptions, such as Maine, Oklahoma, and West Virgina, most states have ",

The states have emerged, albeit unevenly, from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are poised to make new progress toward more effective and equitable preschool policies. Additional states have committed to offering every child publicly funded preschool education and have begun working towards that goal. Enrollment in preschool increased in 2022-2023 and the percent of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds enrolled in preschool reached all-time highs. But the number of children enrolled in state-funded preschool is still lower than it was prior to the pandemic, and six states are still without programs. All but a few states fall short of meeting at least one benchmark for policies regarding quality, and many fall short of meeting most of the benchmarks. Inadequate funding is a near universal problem. A key question for the future is whether or not states will increase funding enough to keep promises regarding program expansion and quality, including adequate pay for the workforce. Will this be the turning point needed for the country to make real progress towards high quality universal preschool?

The states have emerged, albeit unevenly, from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are poised to make new progress toward more effective and equitable preschool policies. Additional states have committed to offering every child publicly funded preschool education and have begun working towards that goal. Enrollment in preschool increased in 2022-2023 and the percent of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds enrolled in preschool reached all-time highs. But the number of children enrolled in state-funded preschool is still lower than it was prior to the pandemic, and six states are still without programs. All but a few states fall short of meeting at least one benchmark for policies regarding quality, and many fall short of meeting most of the benchmarks. Inadequate funding is a near universal problem. A key question for the future is whether or not states will increase funding enough to keep promises regarding program expansion and quality, including adequate pay for the workforce. Will this be the turning point needed for the country to make real progress towards high quality universal preschool?

Universal preschool, by its nature, dramatically increases that scale, thus demanding greater administrative resources.  \"7_26\" demonstrates this link, highlighting substantial preschool funding increases in states like California and New Jersey alongside increased enrollment. This influx necessitates a proportionate increase in administrative personnel and infrastructure. While leveraging existing systems can offer some efficiency, the sheer volume of new students, providers, and funding streams generates significant administrative growth. Ignoring this reality creates an illusion of minimized burden while potentially underestimating the administrative investment required for successful universal preschool.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education. So what exactly is universal preschool, and what are some arguments for and against it? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at some potential pros and cons to help provide a balanced look at the topic. Viacheslav Lopatin \u00a9 123RF.com What is Universal Preschool? In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) currently enrolls over 6000 preschool students as part of their tuition-free universal pre-K initiative, and reports that more than 92% of these students are \u201cmeeting or exceeding developmental expectations.\u201d DCPS requires that preschool teachers hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and teachers are paid a salary comparable to that of K-12 teachers. The DCPS preschool curriculum is grounded in their established Kindergarten Readiness Standards, which focus on subjects such as Social & Emotional Development, Physical Development, Language & Literacy, Mathematical Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Social Studies, and Creative Arts.

However, universal pre-K's impact is less conclusive. Some studies suggest that academic gains from universal programs fade out over time, negating long-term societal benefits (\"9_7\").  Furthermore, the financial strain on private preschools from free public options (\"4_0\", \"4_2\") could lead to a decline in quality and availability of preschool options for those who do not choose public options. This unintended consequence diminishes the overall societal benefit claimed from universal preschool.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: Government-funded preschool does not solely cause private preschool tuition inflation.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_0', 'query': 'The impact of government subsidies on preschool tuition costs', 'title': 'Economic Effects of Expanding Subsidized Child Care and Providing ...', 'url': 'https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57630'}]\n**Short Argument**: Government subsidies, while increasing access for some, do not negate their inflationary impact on private preschool tuition.  Evidence shows increased government spending on preschool coincides with rising tuition costs. (\"2_0\") This suggests subsidies inflate demand, allowing private providers to raise prices, ultimately harming middle-class families who don't qualify for subsidies but struggle with increased market rates.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: A well-planned expansion of universal preschool can minimize administrative burden.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '7_26', 'query': 'Growth of government agencies due to preschool funding', 'title': 'Executive Summary - National Institute for Early Education Research', 'url': 'https://nieer.org/yearbook/2023/executive-summary'}, {'id': '7_27', 'query': 'Growth of government agencies due to preschool funding', 'title': 'Resources to Support Preschool Expansion and Early School Success', 'url': 'https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/resources-support-preschool-expansion-and-early-school-success'}, {'id': '7_35', 'query': 'Administrative costs of public preschool as a percentage of total costs', 'title': 'What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates', 'url': 'https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The assertion that universal preschool expansion minimizes administrative burden is misleading. While streamlining may be intended, the inherent growth in program scale necessitates more, not less, administration.  Evidence shows administrative costs account for 15-20% of total preschool expenses (\"7_35\"), a cost amplified by expansion.  States adding substantial preschool funding illustrate this trend, where increased funding directly correlates with increased enrollment and administrative needs (\"7_26\"). The sheer volume of children entering the system requires significant resources for enrollment, oversight, and compliance, thus increasing the overall administrative burden.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Universal preschool creates unnecessary competition for resources with more pressing educational needs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_10', 'query': 'Cost-benefit analysis of universal preschool programs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '6_20', 'query': 'Most pressing needs in education', 'title': '7 Education Policy Issues That Need to Be Solved in 2020', 'url': 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/education-policy-issues-in-2020/'}, {'id': '6_23', 'query': 'Most pressing needs in education', 'title': 'Four of the biggest problems facing education\u2014and four trends that ...', 'url': 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/four-biggest-problems-facing-education-and-four-trends-could-make-difference'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Implementing universal preschool necessitates significant financial investment, diverting funds from other crucial educational needs.  The Penn Wharton study (\"0_10\") highlighted the substantial costs and negative economic impact of such programs. This creates a direct competition for resources with more pressing issues like the persistent learning crisis, exacerbated by COVID-19 (\"6_23\"), or insufficient teacher pay (\"6_20\"). Targeted interventions for at-risk children or improving existing educational infrastructure offer better returns on investment compared to broad, costly universal programs.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Subsidizing preschool for all reduces the incentive for private investment in early childhood education.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_25', 'query': 'The economics of government-funded preschool and its effect on private preschools', 'title': 'More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ...', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy'}]\n**Short Argument**: Government-funded preschool undercuts the private market by offering \"free\" (taxpayer-funded) alternatives, thus reducing the incentive for private investment. This \"crowd-out\" effect, where public provision displaces private investment, is documented in studies on the impact of universal preschool on childcare markets (2_25).\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Universal preschool can lead to unintended social consequences, such as increased pressure on parents.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_0', 'query': 'negative social consequences of universal preschool', 'title': 'Universal Preschool Programs Expand, Despite Documented Harms', 'url': 'https://fee.org/articles/universal-preschool-programs-expand-despite-documented-harms/'}, {'id': '8_3', 'query': 'negative social consequences of universal preschool', 'title': 'Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good'}, {'id': '8_5', 'query': 'pressure on parents universal preschool', 'title': \"Universal Preschool Cookie-Cutter Pressure: Head Start's Troubling ...\", 'url': 'https://nancyebailey.com/2021/11/13/universal-preschool-cookie-cutter-pressure-head-starts-troubling-framework/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Universal preschool, while seemingly beneficial, can create unintended pressures on parents. Studies reveal the negative impacts of public pre-K programs on children's academic and behavioral outcomes (\"8_0\", \"8_3\"). This, coupled with the pressure to conform to a standardized curriculum (\"8_5\"), can increase parental stress as they grapple with suboptimal learning experiences and pressure to supplement their child's education.\n\n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, judges, and esteemed audience, our opponents paint a rosy picture of universal preschool, but their arguments fail to address the fundamental flaws we\u2019ve highlighted. They advocate for maximizing societal benefit, a broad and subjective measure, while we focus on maximizing the effectiveness of educational spending, a concrete and measurable goal.  This difference in approach is crucial to understanding the true impact of universal preschool.\n\nLet's revisit the issue of resource allocation. Our opponents suggest a synergistic approach, combining universal preschool with targeted interventions.  However, this ideal scenario overlooks the reality of limited resources. As the RAND study [1] demonstrates, targeted interventions for disadvantaged children yield significant benefits.  Conversely, the long-term benefits of universal pre-K are less clear, with some studies suggesting academic gains fade over time [2].  Furthermore, the pressure on private preschools from free public options [3, 4] could lead to a decline in quality, impacting families who choose non-public options. This undercuts the overall societal benefit they claim.\n\nNext, let's address tuition costs. Our opponents argue that multiple factors contribute to rising tuition, but they fail to acknowledge the inflationary pressure of government subsidies. Evidence shows increased government spending coincides with rising tuition [5]. Subsidies, while increasing access for some, create artificial demand, allowing private providers to raise prices.  This disproportionately harms middle-class families who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies but face increased market rates.  Think about it\u2014if you're a middle-class family, you\u2019re stuck paying higher prices without the benefit of subsidies.\n\nRegarding administrative burden, our opponents claim a well-planned expansion can minimize the burden.  This is simply wishful thinking.  Any expansion, regardless of planning, inherently increases administrative needs. Remember, administrative costs already consume 15-20% of preschool expenses [6]. This cost will inevitably grow with program expansion.  As states increase preschool funding, they experience increased enrollment and, consequently, greater administrative demands [7].  More children mean more resources required for enrollment, oversight, and compliance.  The notion that this burden can be minimized is unrealistic.\n\nMoreover, universal preschool creates competition for resources with other pressing educational needs.  The Penn Wharton study [8] highlighted the substantial costs and potentially negative economic impacts of universal programs.  These funds could be better used to address pressing issues like the learning crisis exacerbated by COVID-19 [9] or inadequate teacher pay [10].  Imagine if those funds went towards supporting struggling students or attracting better teachers\u2014the potential positive impact on education is undeniable.\n\nFurthermore, government-funded preschool discourages private investment in early childhood education. By offering \"free\" alternatives, it creates a \"crowd-out\" effect, displacing private investment [11]. This limits innovation and choice in the preschool market, ultimately harming the diversity and quality of early childhood education.\n\nFinally, consider the unintended social consequences.  Studies reveal negative impacts of public pre-K on academic and behavioral outcomes [12, 13].  The pressure to conform to standardized curriculums [14] increases parental stress.  Parents may feel forced to supplement their child's education due to suboptimal learning experiences, adding extra costs and time commitments.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n[2] Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good\n[3] The Controversy of Universal Preschool and How It Affects Childcare ... https://www.daycarestudio.net/home/the-controversy-of-universal-preschool-and-how-it-affects-childcare-providers\n[4] Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses ... - KQED. https://www.kqed.org/news/11893791/why-californias-universal-transitional-kindergarten-plan-poses-a-threat-to-some-early-childhood-ed-providers\n[5] Economic Effects of Expanding Subsidized Child Care and Providing ... https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57630\n[6] What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates. https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool\n[7] Resources to Support Preschool Expansion and Early School Success. https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/resources-support-preschool-expansion-and-early-school-success\n[8] Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/\n[9] Four of the biggest problems facing education\u2014and four trends that ... https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/four-biggest-problems-facing-education-and-four-trends-could-make-difference\n[10] 7 Education Policy Issues That Need to Be Solved in 2020. https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/education-policy-issues-in-2020/\n[11] More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ... https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy\n[12] Universal Preschool Programs Expand, Despite Documented Harms. https://fee.org/articles/universal-preschool-programs-expand-despite-documented-harms/\n[13] Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good\n[14] Universal Preschool Cookie-Cutter Pressure: Head Start's Troubling ... https://nancyebailey.com/2021/11/13/universal-preschool-cookie-cutter-pressure-head-starts-troubling-framework/\n",

        "statements": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate hinges on whether subsidizing preschool truly maximizes societal benefit, our core judging criteria.  The negative team argues for targeted interventions, claiming universal pre-K is inefficient. We contend this is a false choice.  We can, and should, do both. Research shows combining universal access with targeted support maximizes positive impact [3].  Furthermore, universal pre-K offers unique long-term societal benefits, like increased social mobility [2] and a stronger workforce [9], advantages targeted programs alone cannot achieve.  Concerning their argument about declining private preschool quality, quality control measures like mandatory accreditation and regular inspections would ensure standards are maintained across all providers, public and private.\n\nOur opponents also claim subsidies artificially inflate tuition.  This ignores the reality that multiple factors, including rising operational costs and inflation, contribute to tuition increases. Subsidies, however, directly address affordability for low-income families [5], enabling access to quality preschool otherwise unattainable.  Furthermore, subsidies can stimulate competition.  To mitigate potential cost increases, we propose tying subsidy amounts to a sliding scale based on provider quality ratings and operating costs, incentivizing both affordability and high standards.  This market-based approach promotes value and efficiency.\n\nThe negative team's argument against government funding discouraging private investment is unfounded. Subsidies actually *stimulate* the market by increasing demand, attracting new providers and encouraging innovation\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heckman, J. J.

Steven Barnett (2010) In the United States, enrollments in preschool center-based programs have leveled off at about 75 percent of four-year-olds and 50 percent of three year olds. Nearly all government programs restrict eligibility to children in low-income families, and these families have substantially increased preschool participation rates as a result. However, in the last decade little progress was made toward increasing enrollments, despite increases in government spending, and less than half of children in poverty attend public programs even at age four. The average educational quality of private programs is quite low, and public programs are only modestly better. As a result, the educational effectiveness of preschool programs in the United States tends to be much weaker than that of the well-known programs research has shown be cost-effective. This paper considers whether publicly funded preschool education for all children would alleviate these problems. Universal public preschool education would reach many more children in poor and low-income families. For means-tested programs constantly changing incomes present a moving target, while the stigma associated with programs for the poor also limits participation. Program effectiveness would be at least as good in a universal program as in targeted program, and effectiveness might actually improve. One source of increased effectiveness is peer effects on learning. In addition, parents from higher-income families may be better advocates for quality, and political support for quality may be higher. Children from middle- and higher-income families also will benefit from high-quality publicly-subsidized preschool programs. A universal approach will cost more than current targeted programs, but moving from targeted to universal public preschool education is likely to produce benefits that far exceed the additional cost.

Debates nevertheless abound on the most promising and cost-effective strategies to address the problem. We examine critically the available evidence on the benefits and costs of early childhood education and conclude that early, vigorous interventions targeted at disadvantaged children offer the best chance to substantially reduce gaps in school readiness and increase the productivity of our educational systems. The available evidence fails to provide a complete road map for future investments, however. Hence, we propose a program of challenge grants to states and their subunits, coupled with waivers from regulation, to spur innovation and experimentation within this important research area. We provide examples of the types of experiments that could be funded and discuss important considerations in the development and implementation of such a research grants program.

Greenwood, Ph.D. In recent years, there has been renewed interest in the influence of early childhood\u2014particularly, the first 3 years of life\u2014on health and development, educational attainment, and economic well-being. Contributing to this interest are research findings indicating that most physical development in the brain occurs by age 3. A recent RAND report, Investing in Our Children: What We Know and Don\u2019t Know About the Costs and Benefits of Early Childhood Interventions, assembles available evidence on two questions of interest to policymakers, who must allocate resources, and to taxpayers, who provide those resources: u Do early interventions targeted at disadvantaged children benefit participating children and their families? After criti-cally reviewing the literature and discounting claims that are not rigorously demonstrated, the report concludes that these programs can provide significant benefits. u Might government funds invested early in the lives of children yield compensating decreases in government expenditures? The report examines the possibility that early interventions may save some children and their parents from incurring State expenditures through criminal justice, welfare, and other costs. Updating and refining earlier estimates, the report concludes that, at least for some disadvantaged children and their families, decreased government expenditures might result from early childhood intervention. The report uses words like \u201ccan\u201d and \u201cmight\u201d deliberately and does not generalize its conclusions to all types of targeted early interventions\u2014in particular, large-scale programs. It notes limitations in the evidence collected to date that suggest that enhanced evaluations of intervention efforts would be of value to future ",

Benefits in terms of child development and maternal employment are estimated using evidence on the causal effects of this reform. In the baseline estimation the benefit-cost ratio is over 4, indicating sizeable net societal benefits of the preschool investment. The results show that the child development effects are the major determinant of the cost-benefit ratio; the employment gains for parents appear to play a relatively minor role. Overall, the cost-benefit analysis provides support for investing in high-quality preschool education. \u00a9 2017 The Authors.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education. So what exactly is universal preschool, and what are some arguments for and against it? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at some potential pros and cons to help provide a balanced look at the topic. Viacheslav Lopatin \u00a9 123RF.com What is Universal Preschool? In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) currently enrolls over 6000 preschool students as part of their tuition-free universal pre-K initiative, and reports that more than 92% of these students are \u201cmeeting or exceeding developmental expectations.\u201d DCPS requires that preschool teachers hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and teachers are paid a salary comparable to that of K-12 teachers. The DCPS preschool curriculum is grounded in their established Kindergarten Readiness Standards, which focus on subjects such as Social & Emotional Development, Physical Development, Language & Literacy, Mathematical Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Social Studies, and Creative Arts.

The evidence for universal programs, however, is less conclusive. The present paper examines the claims of universal and targeted approaches to preventing early education gaps. First, recent findings on the universal unitary early education and care systems in Denmark and Norway are reviewed regarding the educational quality and compensating effects on disadvantaged children. Second, the advantages and disadvantages of targeted approaches are discussed, focusing in particular on the trade-off between cost-effectiveness and aggregated impact on society. Third, the Dutch educational equity policy will be analyzed as a\u00a0case in point to illustrate the dilemmas, contradictions and paradoxes of equity policy pertaining to targeted and universal approaches. Finally, as a\u00a0synthesis of the findings, two complementary approaches are outlined: a\u00a0universal withi",

Nearly all government programs restrict eligibility to children in low-income families, and these families have substantially increased preschool participation rates as a result. However, in the last decade little progress was made toward increasing enrollments, despite increases in government spending, and less than half of children in poverty attend public programs even at age four. The average educational quality of private programs is quite low, and public programs are only modestly better. As a result, t",

With a nationwide increase in state-funded Pre-K programs over the past 40 years, a Brookings Institute\u2019s study, \u201cExpectations of sustained effects from scaled up Pre-K: Challenges from the Tennessee\u201d, reports that now nearly a third of all 4-year-olds attend a state funded Pre-K program and evaluations are trying to catch up to provide an understanding of the long-term impacts. Research on early childhood education has been extensive and has demonstrated the importance of high-quality early childhood education on long-term child development and academic achievement. Recent studies, however, have shown mixed results. Much of this research was conducted several years ago in targeted and structured high-quality child care programs that included a focus on health and well-being, family engagement, and hands-on learning opportunities.

The methodology will employ exogenous differences in eligibility across states and from these age restrictions to create \u2018treatment\u2019 and \u2018control\u2019 groups which will be used to determine program effects. The dataset used will be the 2000 confidential decennial long-form sample. The proposed project will increase the utility to the U.S. Census Bureau of the data it collects by satisfying Criteria 9 and Criteria 11. The project will produce valuable estimates for use in an academic journal article. Also, as was pointed out to us in discussions with Census Bureau officials in the Demographic Directorate program areas, the better understanding of family behavior regarding work and childcare produced by this project will allow for insight that could change the way the Census Bureau asks its questions regarding early childhood education and care.

Using admissions lotteries, the research found that participation in the preschool program led to significant long-term improvements in academic and behavioral outcomes in children. From the study authors: This work studies the impact of Boston Public Schools\u2019 (BPS) public preschool program using data on more than 4,000 preschool applicants from 1997 to 2003. The study leverages the randomization embedded in the BPS preschool lottery-based assignment process to compare the outcomes of students who won a preschool seat to students whose random lottery number was not high enough to win a seat. Notably, compared to students who did not attend the Boston Public Schools preschool program, attendees in this study were more likely to graduate high school, more likely to take the SAT, more likely to enroll in college on-time, and more likely to ever enroll in college. Additionally, students who attended preschool had fewer school suspensions in high school and were less likely to experience juvenile incarceration. Read the full study here and the brief here. According to the researchers: \u201cAs policymakers consider increased public investment in universal preschool, the research findings suggest that preschool can lead to long-term educational attainment gains through improvements in behavior. Furthermore, the observed effects across demographic groups suggest that all students are likely to benefit from universal preschool.\u201d The findings of this study add to the ever-growing arsenal of research and data that show the undeniable short- and long-term benefits of high-quality early childhood education.

However, traditional preschool may not be the best option for every family. Fortunately, there are numerous alternatives to preschool that can provide a unique and enriching experience for young children. One alternative to preschool is homeschooling. As a homeschooling parent myself, I can attest to the benefits of this option. Homeschooling allows parents to tailor their child\u2019s education to their individual needs and interests, and provides a more personalized learning experience than traditional schools can offer. It also allows for more flexibility in scheduling, which can be a major advantage for families with busy or non-traditional work schedules. Another alternative to preschool is outdoor play-based activities. This option allows children to explore and learn in a natural environment, which can be incredibly beneficial for their development. Activities such as hiking, camping, gardening, and nature walks can provide numerous opportunities for learning and growth. Additionally, this option can be more affordable than traditional preschool programs, as many outdoor activities are low-cost or free.

Source: Wikimedia Waldorf founder Robert Steiner was interested in the ways that spiritualism and science intersect; he called his pursuit of these connections anthrophosophy. In post-WWI Germany, the writer and philosopher was invited to found a school for the children of employees at the Walford-Astoria cigarette factory, based in Stuttgart. Influenced heavily by the war\u2019s destruction\u2013and apparently ghostly visions of his dead aunt\u2013Steiner decided to create a learning atmosphere that would teach children to be peaceful and just members of society in hopes that the world might eventually follow suit. The Waldorf classroom structure defied conventional methods of schooling: it was coed, self-governing in terms of the school\u2019s administration and didn\u2019t require an entrance exam. Many of the Waldorf school\u2019s original structures remain to the present. Today, Waldorf schools still maintain admi",

As researchers involved with early care and education, we should be pleased that President Biden\u2019s first State of the Union address underscored his administration\u2019s commitment to public universal preschool. His plan could provide access for millions of children and families. Yet, our excitement is tempered by concerns that children will not thrive if we put more \u201cschool\u201d into preschool. We urge policymakers to move away from the belief that young children need two more years of \u201cschool\u201d before kindergarten. Preschool experiences can help set the stage for children to flourish academically, but an overemphasis on teacher-led instruction of school-readiness skills may do just the opposite. The early childhood brain evolves to flourish not through rigorous schooling, in any traditional sense, but through exploration, interaction and conversation. The surge in neural pruning and plateau in cortex volume that characterize the middle childhood brain remain a few years away for the preschooler \u2014 and so should traditional schooling. Science shows us precisely what high-quality early childhood classrooms should look like: full of warmth and support with multiple chances to explore the world while having rich conversations with teachers and classmates. Having the \u201cright\u201d curriculum cannot make a pre-K classroom high quality, but well-trained teachers can; high-quality classrooms have teachers who stimulate and then build on children\u2019s interests; design spaces where children have some autonomy; talk with children in ways and on topics that keep them engaged; and open the world for chi",

Summary H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law. On average, parents\u2019 employment would probably increase slightly under both programs. This document does not examine effects that would arise from how the programs were financed.

Report Highlights Market Failures in America\u2019s Child Care System and How Build Back Better Can Help The Department of Treasury released the Economics of Child Care Supply, a report analyzing America\u2019s existing child care system that demonstrates how the private, market-based system fails to meet the needs of many families. Under the current system, parents are unable to afford high child care costs, providers operate on razor-thin margins maintaining slim profits, and child care workers earn low wages and have high turnover. Furthermore, underinvestment has worsened families\u2019 access to high-quality child care options and resulted in a bleak current state of affairs, in which early childhood education is unaffordable, inaccessible, and of low quality for many families. After an examination of the child care market and its inefficiencies, the report concludes by highlighting how policies within the Build Back Better Act can mitigate market failures and build a child care system that truly works for the families who need it.\u00a0 Significant Benefits Yet Insufficient Investment\u00a0 The benefits of high-quality and inclusive early childhood education are well documented and have lasting impacts on the lives of children, parents, and the economy at large. Investments in early education are an investment into the vitality of the American economy as children who participate have healthier development, do better in school, and are less involved in crime, all of which decrease healthcare and criminal justice expenditures. Even despite the well-documented and widespread benefits of early care and education, however, the U.S. reports among the lowest amount of investment compared to other nations.

Since Georgia used a voucher-like program and Oklahoma utilized its existing public schools, the two states offer a case study of how government provision compares to government subsidization alone. Using a synthetic control group difference-in-difference estimation framework, we examine the effects of universal preschool on childcare providers. In both states there is an increase in the number of formal childcare centers. With the voucher-like program in Georgia, the overall increase in care is partly driven by an increase in the supply of formal childcare in the private sector and partly driven by new publicly-provided preschools. However, there is substantial crowd-out of private consumption of preschool. In Oklahoma, where universal preschool is publicly provided, the increase in the number of childcare providers occurred only in the public sector. The expansion of publicly-provided care seems to be driven largely by movement of employees from private centers to public settings. As such, this case-study comparison suggests that government subsidization through funding was more effec",

From that perspective it makes little sense to provide the same universal access to preschool programs as to K-12 education. The view of preschool as welfare influences the way preschool education is financed and helps explain why the US doesn\u2019t offer every child a quality preschool education. Preschool funding is much more heavily dependent on a patchwork of federal programs \u2014 a tradition more reflective of social insurance programs than public education, which is primarily a state and local responsibility. As a result in most states preschool programs including Head Start and subsidized child care target only the most vulnerable young children \u2014 a noble goal for sure, but even these programs fail to reach most of the intended beneficiaries and funding levels are far from adequate for a quality early education. If the US public was more convinced of the educational value of pre-K, would we see more state and local financial resources being invested? It seems likely. Most states do provide some funding for preschool and child care, but local funding is much less common. By contrast, 45% of public K-12 education comes from local taxes, the large majority from property tax receipts. State resources account for another 47% of spending. The rest \u2014 just 8% \u2014 is filled by federal funds. If the local share for early childhood programs were equal to that for K-12, funding for state pre-K programs would just about double. Taking a broader view including Head Start and state funded pre-K, just over half of the dollars come from federal government financing (51%), with states providing 39% and just 9% deriving from local sources. With a few notable exceptions, such as Maine, Oklahoma, and West Virgina, most states have ",

The problem of funding a public preschool occurs not only from limited sources but from the cost per child. The average cost across the 48 states is $6,582. There are four categories that determine the costs of public preschools: personnel ratios, personnel qualifications, facilities and transportation, and health and nutrition services. According to Levin and Schwartz these structural elements depend heavily on the cost and quality of services provided. The main personnel factor related to cost is the qualifications each preschool require for a teacher. Another determinate of cost is the length of a preschool day. The longer the session, the more increase in cost. Therefore, the quality of program accounts presumably for a major component of cost. Collaboration has been a solution for funding issues in several districts. Wilma Kaplan, principal, turned to collaborating with the area Head Start and other private preschool to fund a public preschool in her district. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the interaction.

Free preschool is the exception in the U.S. Here's how experts say you can find programs near you and advocate for universal pre-K. Many parents assume they\u2019ll send their children to preschool before kindergarten. After all, vast amounts of research shows that preschool, also sometimes called pre-K, benefits kids socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively. It helps prepare them for school and exposes them to new ways of interacting with the world. It can even result in better health outcomes and lower rates of crime and teen pregnancy, studies say. Sadly, many parents get a rude awakening when they learn that preschool in America isn\u2019t free for all students.\u00a0 While some cities and states have been rolling out free pre-K programs, in many areas, free programs are typically only available to low-income families, if at all, says Dr. Danielle Twigg, founder of Little Bird Consulting, an early childhood education consulting service.\u00a0Instead, many parents have little choice but to pay for public or private preschool programs, which may not be financially possible, even for middle class families. So, what\u2019s a parent to do?

BBB includes policies and investments that, if enacted, would save families thousands of dollars in child care and preschool costs and build a strong, stable early learning system that meets the needs of families, providers, and the economy. The proposed federal investments in child care and pre-K, underscore the commitment of Congress and the Biden administration to finding solutions to America\u2019s longstanding child care crisis by addressing widespread challenges with access, affordability, and quality in early learning, while reinforcing the benefits of a strong mixed-delivery system that prioritizes parent choice in determining the type and setting of care that best meets a family\u2019s needs. The proposal seeks to resolve chronic foundational flaws in America\u2019s child care market caused by decades of underinvestment, which create an entirely unsustainable business model for providers that often translates into near-poverty wages for early educators. Additionally, the proposal would build on existing state and federal preschool programs by providing funding to cover the federal share of the cost of a voluntary, free universal pre-K (UPK) program for all children, regardless of income or other eligibility requirements, in a variety of settings. Please note the final language is still being negotiated, and changes are likely. FFYF will continue to monitor negotiations and update this document regularly to reflect any such changes.

Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages.

That estimate applies to Rules Committee Print 117-18 incorporating a manager\u2019s amendment by Congressman Yarmuth. H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.1 In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law. On average, parents\u2019 employment would probably increase slightly under both programs. This document does not examine effects t",

                  "raw_content": "Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Key Points Public preschool improves the eventual labor productivity of young children who are enrolled. These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

View Document264 KB Summary H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law.

One in every 110 U.S. workers \u2013 and one in every 55 working women \u2013 makes a living in early childhood education and care. Parents of young children devote a sizeable share of their total income to child care. Children benefit enormously from high-quality early childhood settings that nurture and support healthy development, all while laying the foundation for future success by supporting early learning skills. An extensive body of research describes large potential economic returns to investments in early childhood education and care for preschool children, especially for children from less advantaged families. To allow more families to access high-quality care, capture the return to quality early childhood programs, and enable inclusive growth both today and for future generations, the Build Back Better Agenda proposes important investments in child care and early childhood education. This report describes the existing child care system in the United States, which relies on private financing to provide care for most children, and documents how this system fails to adequately serve many families. This is not just happenstance \u2013 sound economic principles explain why relying on private money to provide child care is bound to come up short. Currently, the average family with at least one child under age 5 would need to devote about 13 percent of family income to pay for child care, a number that is unafordable for most families. Less than 20 percent of children eligible for one of the largest federal assistance programs for low-income families, the Child Care and Development Fund, actually receives funding. Notwithstanding the high costs borne by parents, margins for child care providers are low and many struggle to make ends meet. They survive by keeping costs low. Labor, the",

A proposal to restore the lower interest rate of 3.4 percent on student loans from its recently increased 6.8 percent for another year failed in the Senate on Wednesday. The common response to this vote is that it is a tragedy. It isn't. First, even the 6.8 percent rate, students are still benefiting from a significant subsidy; the rate on similar loans that students obtain in the private market is about 12 percent. Second, extending the lower rate would be reckless since it would continue to artificially inflate the student loan bubble. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York shows that over the past decade, student loan debt has increased by 281 percent, from about $260 billion in the first quarter of 2004 to $990 billion in the first quarter of 2013 and is now higher than the country's collective credit card debt.

Federal Pell grants are more than $30 billion a year, federal student loans are about $100 billion a year, and grants to colleges and universities are $2.5 billion a year.1 This essay explores the origins of federal subsidies for higher education and the rapid growth since the 1960s. Then it discusses the harmful effects of higher education subsidies. Those effects include tuition cost inflation, increased regulatory control of colleges and universities, and large amounts of waste, fraud, and abuse. Origins of Subsidies Federal subsidies for higher education began in 1862 with the Morrill Act, which provided grants of federal land to the states. The states were supposed to use the proceeds of land sales to create colleges focused on agricultural and mechanical studies, but \"many states squandered the revenue from this endowment.\"2 A second Morrill Act in 1890 began regular appropriations for the land-grant colleges. In 1917 Congress passed the Smith-Hughes Act, which funded the salaries of local vocational education teachers. The act imposed a range of detailed rules on the funded schools, which was an early precedent for today\u2019s mass of federal regulations on state and local education systems. The first major subsidy for students in higher education was the Servicemen\u2019s Readjustment Act of 1944\u2014the G.I. Bill\u2014which allowed World War II veterans to attend college at no cost. The G.I. Bill was admired legislation, but like all subsidy programs it led to wasteful spending and abuse. Some colleges used federal funds for extraneous purposes, such as swimming pools and stadiums, while others increased tuition rates charged to veterans.3 There were also cases of outright fraud by schools that wanted to gar",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

At the national level, politicians have touted universal childcare as a solution to the childcare crisis. At the state level, in\u00a0 Minnesota, for instance, legislators have proposed increased funding for state programs. This idea seems to ignore one important point, however. Childcare is unaffordable and hard to find for the most part due to burdensome regulations. Subsidizing childcare, therefore, does not deal with the root cause of the crisis, but only makes it worse. Here is why. Government funding exacerbates the regulatory burden on providers Programs that are funded by public funds usually tend to have a lot of bureaucracy and regulations. This is because governments, unlike markets, do not possess signaling tools for quality. So they make up for this by increasing regulations for those programs. This has already been seen in the Child Care and Development Block\u00a0 Grant (CCDBG). When Congress reenacted the CCDBG in 2014,\u00a0 states were tasked with enacting numerous regulatory reforms.\u00a0Minnesota, among other things, increased training requirements, enhanced background studies, and increased the frequency of inspections for childcare facilities. These regulations can be especially destructive to family childcare providers since they are small and do not have enough resources to invest in regulatory compliance.

The study, co-authored by Associate Professor Chris Herbst from Arizona State University, examined how the use of child care subsidies influence a child\u2019s ability to succeed in school, both emotionally and cognitively. The results of the study suggest that children receiving subsidized child care in the year before kindergarten score lower on tests of cognitive ability and reveal more behavior problems throughout kindergarten. The research also tracked child development beyond the kindergarten year and those results suggest that the impact of subsidy receipt does not persist beyond kindergarten. \u201cThe main conclusion from our research is that, although U.S. child care subsidy policy is effective at increasing the work effort of low-skilled mothers, it is less successful at enhancing the health and well-being of children and families,\u201d Tekin said in an interview with the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management.

View Document264 KB Summary H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031.

By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time.

Could public preschool benefit your children? The school districts in Georgia and New York do, and they subsequently have created a universal preschool curriculum for four-year-old students. While many parents, teachers, and communities debate the benefits of a public-wide preschool, many states are considering mandated and/or government-supported programs for young children and families. Why the Public Preschool is Gaining Attention Political Base states: \u201cState-funded public preschool is usually a means-tested program that provides early education to 3 and 4-year-olds. The goal in providing subsidized public preschool for low-income families is to provide a stable environment for young children during a crucial age of development.\u201d Essentially, since lower-income families cannot always provide sufficient child care, \u201ctheir children would be left at home. For many, this means unstable environments and T.V.s instead of teachers. It may also force single parents to stay home to raise children instead of work.\u201d As a result of these struggles, many states are implementing government-funded schools and educational programs to provide lower-income families with added assistance. Building on this framework, the state-mandated preschool programs are also ideally intended to provide families of all financial backgrounds with more supportive educational options for c",

The ir development is affected by the qual ity of these arrangements , as children benefit from the supportive learning environment s found in higher -quality programs . States have broad discretion in setting subsidy policies, and policies vary considerably from state to state. A key question is wheth er the re is an observable relationship between the quality of child care centers serving subsidized children and state subsidy policies , such as the level of subsidy reimbursement rates, the use of tiered reimbursement s to incentivize quality improvement , or the practice of paying for care when children are absent . Findings from a statistical analysis of the 2012 National Survey of Early Care and Education (NSECE) generally reveal the expected relationships between state subsidy policies and the quality o f centers participating in the subsidy program. That is, the quality of these child care centers is higher in states with higher reimbursement rates and a larger gap between the ir highest and lowest reimbursement tiers , even after controlling for a variety of other state differences . Although quality is measured using proxy indicators and we cannot be sure that the observed associations are causal, our findi ngs suggest that state agencies can affect the quality of centers participating in the subsidy system through their policy choices regarding rates and related payment policies.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

The states have emerged, albeit unevenly, from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and are poised to make new progress toward more effective and equitable preschool policies. Additional states have committed to offering every child publicly funded preschool education and have begun working towards that goal. Enrollment in preschool increased in 2022-2023 and the percent of 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds enrolled in preschool reached all-time highs. But the number of children enrolled in state-funded preschool is still lower than it was prior to the pandemic, and six states are still without programs. All but a few states fall short of meeting at least one benchmark for policies regarding quality, and many fall short of meeting most of the benchmarks. Inadequate funding is a near universal problem. A key question for the future is whether or not states will increase funding enough to keep promises regarding program expansion and quality, including adequate pay for the workforce. Will this be the turning point needed for the country to make real progress towards high quality universal preschool?

Nov 15, 2023 Quality,\u00a0Cost & Expenses,\u00a0Education & Development (913 Preview) When it comes to choosing a preschool for your child, there are several options available. Two of the most popular choices are private and public preschools. Private preschools are typically run by independent organizations, while public preschools are part of the public school system. But does it really matter which one you choose? Research has shown that attending preschool can have a significant impact on a child's social, emotional, and academic development. Preschool can help children develop important skills like communication, problem-solving, and cooperation. It can also help them prepare for kindergarten and future academic success. However, the quality of the preschool experience can vary greatly depending on the program's curriculum, teacher qualifications, and resources. Parents should prioritize finding a high-quality preschool, whether it's private or public, to ensure their child has the best possible start to their education. A high-quality preschool experience can set the foundation for a lifetime of learning and success. Private Preschool vs. Public Preschool: Does It Matter?

As a parent, you want to ensure that your little one has the best possible start to their educational journey. One of the most common questions parents face is whether to send their child to a private preschool or a public one. The difference between the two can be quite significant, and it\u2019s essential to understand each option before making a decision. Private preschools are often known for their smaller class sizes, which can be beneficial for children who require more one-on-one attention. They also tend to have a more focused curriculum that is tailored to each child\u2019s individual needs. In contrast, public preschools are generally more affordable and have more extensive class sizes, which can be beneficial for children who enjoy socializing with others. The curriculum is often more standardized, and teachers may not have as much flexibility to tailor lessons to individual children. Understanding the differences between these two types of preschools is crucial in identifying which option is best for your child\u2019s individual needs. Private Preschool Curriculum Private Preschool Curriculum One of the main differences between private and public preschools is the curriculum. Private preschools have the advantage of being able to develop their own curriculum, often with a specific philosophy or mission in mind. This means that the curriculum can be tailored to the needs of the individual child, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. Private preschools can choose to focus on a variety of areas, including early literacy, math, science, art, and social-emotional development.

State-by-State Expense Breakdown Across the United States, preschool expenditures show significant variance, with figures heavily influenced by regional economic conditions and living costs. These expenses represent a weighty consideration for families, especially when considering the age of their children and the duration of required care. In comparison to median incomes, some states present a disproportionate average cost burden for childcare, often reflecting a broader economic narrative.

Why do child-care and preschool programs cost so much when providers are paid so little? \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make any sense to [parents],\u201d said Simon Workman, the associate director of early-childhood policy at the Center for American Progress. \u201cFor some people there\u2019s a feeling of, \u2018Is that money going to profits?\u2019 and for others it\u2019s just complete confusion about where that money goes.\u201d To help sort this all out, the advocacy group has released a new online, interactive tool and a corresponding report by Workman entitled, \u201cWhere Does Your Child Care Dollar Go? Understanding the True Cost of Quality Early Childhood Education.\u201d The tool provides an estimate of the cost of child care in each state and breaks down how the primary expenses fit into that cost. For example, the tool shows that it would cost $1,134 a month to enroll a toddler in a base-quality child-care program in Maryland. Users can also control variables such as classroom size and teacher pay to see how that affects the cost. So, if the class size is reduced and the teacher pay is raised to equal the average salary of a kindergarten teacher, the price jumps to $1,515 a month. The tool also allows users to find information on the cost of providing care to infants and preschool children. But no matter what the child\u2019s age the majority of the costs associated with child care go to teacher salaries and benefits. The report finds that these workforce expenses take between 60 and 80 percent of the total expenses to run a program. The rest of the money goes to things such as rent, office equipment, classroom supplies, and food. The report also stresses that high-quality programs come with a higher price tag, which includes the costs associated with higher salaries and exceeding state licensing standards. It lists the cost of a base-quality and high-quality program for infants, toddlers and preschoolers in every state. In California, a ba",

CCDF is the primary federal funding source devoted to helping families with low incomes afford child care and to increasing the quality of child care for all children. Under CCDF, funding is provided to states, and states have flexibility to determine certain policies within federal parameters. The changes in the final rule include new requirements states will have to meet to 1) lower families' child care costs; 2) improve child care provider payment rates and practices; and 3) simplify subsidy eligibility and enrollment. The final rule also recommends, but does not require, that states adopt additional policies and procedures to meet these goals. The 2024 CCDF Final Rule also includes technical and other changes to improve clarity and program implementation. The full rule can be found in the Federal Register . In April 2023, President Biden released an Executive Order on Increasing Access to High-Quality Care and Supporting Caregivers that directed federal agencies to \u201cmake all efforts to provide support for caregivers, increase access to affordable care for families, and provide more care options for families.\u201d 1 As a response to this order, ACF first announced proposed changes to CCDF with the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) on July 13, 2023, followed by a 45-day public comment period.

According to Levin and Schwartz these structural elements depend heavily on the cost and quality of services provided. The main personnel factor related to cost is the qualifications each preschool require for a teacher. Another determinate of cost is the length of a preschool day. The longer the session, the more increase in cost. Therefore, the quality of program accounts presumably for a major component of cost. Collaboration has been a solution for funding issues in several districts. Wilma Kaplan, principal, turned to collaborating with the area Head Start and other private preschool to fund a public preschool in her district. \u201cWe\u2019re very pleased with the interaction. It\u2019s really added a dimension to our program that\u2019s been very positive\u201d. The National Head Start Bureau has been looking for more opportunities to partner with public schools.

Families often encounter a complex tapestry of childcare, child care expenses, and college tuition, intersecting with fluctuating income levels \u2013 a critical factor in early education decisions. Dissecting the Cost of Preschool In examining the landscape of preschool costs, it\u2019s essential to consider the multifaceted variables that contribute to these expenses. These can range from state-funded program availability to the cost of living, median family incomes, state-specific regulations, and the overall childcare landscape within each state. The variability observed underscores the intricate balance between quality of education, childcare options, and financial accessibility. Detailed state-by-state analysis reveals not only the stark disparities in preschool costs, often aligned with regional economic markers, but also the breadth of program options, from private to public initiatives, reflecting diverse socioeconomic priorities and strategies in supporting early childhood education. State-by-State Expense Breakdown Across the United States, preschool expenditures show significant variance, with figures heavily influenced by regional economic conditions and living costs. These expenses represent a weighty consideration for families, especially when considering the age of their children and the duration of required care. In comparison to median incomes, some states present a disproportionate average cost burden for childcare, often reflecting a broader economic narrative. This underscores the importance of state-specific financial strategies for early education.

Using admissions lotteries, the research found that participation in the preschool program led to significant long-term improvements in academic and behavioral outcomes in children. From the study authors: This work studies the impact of Boston Public Schools\u2019 (BPS) public preschool program using data on more than 4,000 preschool applicants from 1997 to 2003. The study leverages the randomization embedded in the BPS preschool lottery-based assignment process to compare the outcomes of students who won a preschool seat to students whose random lottery number was not high enough to win a seat. Notably, compared to students who did not attend the Boston Public Schools preschool program, attendees in this study were more likely to graduate high school, more likely to take the SAT, more likely to enroll in college on-time, and more likely to ever enroll in college. Additionally, students who attended preschool had fewer school suspensions in high school and were less likely to experience juvenile incarceration. Read the full study here and the brief here. According to the researchers: \u201cAs policymakers consider increased public investment in universal preschool, the research findings suggest that preschool can lead to long-term educational attainment gains through improvements in behavior.

Mar. 15, 2024 \u2022 By Studies Weekly Universal pre-K is a state policy framework to provide every child with a quality, publicly funded preschool education. The National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) reports that many states still do not have a universal pre-K policy, and some do not have any state-funded preschool at all, but those numbers are quickly changing as the universal pre-K movement catches on across the nation. What makes a Universal Pre-K Program universal? Many states have limited state-sponsored pre-K programs, but the programs must offer eligibility to every four-year-old in the state to be \u201cuniversal.\u201d NIEER also does not consider a program universal unless its enrollment reaches 70% of all four-year-olds in the state. At the time of the most recent State of Preschool report in 2022, only 11 states had implemented universal pre-K policies, and only 32% of four-year-olds and 6% of three-year-olds participated in a state-funded pre-K program at all.

The school districts in Georgia and New York do, and they subsequently have created a universal preschool curriculum for four-year-old students. While many parents, teachers, and communities debate the benefits of a public-wide preschool, many states are considering mandated and/or government-supported programs for young children and families. Why the Public Preschool is Gaining Attention Political Base states: As a result of these struggles, many states are implementing government-funded schools and educational programs to provide lower-income families with added assistance. Building on this framework, the state-mandated preschool programs are also ideally intended to provide families of all financial backgrounds with more supportive educational options for children of a younger age. The Benefits of Preschool One of the most significant benefits of publicly mandated preschool programs is ensuring that lower-income families have opportunities to enroll their children in early education programs while saving on the often expensive costs of preschool and childcare programs. As policy analyst Darcy Ann Olsen also supports, \u201cMost advocates of public preschool argue that early schooling of low-income children is an investment that pays off in the long term by reducing the number of children who will perform poorly in school, become teenage parents, commit criminal acts, or depend on welfare. Other advocates of public preschool see it as a way to subsidize child care.\u201d This video entitled Make the Most of Every Minute in Your Preschool Program gives us an overview of what's involved in a preschool program. To ameliorate these widespread social issues of lower-income family access to resources, education, and child care, the early education program \u201cHead Start,\u201d formed in 1965, has helped provide researchers with insight into the advantages of early education programs for young kids. \u201cHead Start\u201d has provided child care and educa",

New studies of large-scale preschool programs in Quebec and Tennessee show that vastly expanding access to free or subsidized preschool may worsen behavioral and emotional outcomes. Even proponents of universal preschool admit that it does nothing to improve future academic performance.

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

Abstract We measure the impact of universal prekindergarten for four-year-olds by exploiting a natural experiment in which the Australian state of Queensland eliminated its public prekindergarten program in 2007. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that five months of access to universal prekindergarten leads to an increase of 0.23 standard deviations in general school readiness.

Family\u2013school engagement can take multiple forms; in this review, we focus on universal preschool-based outreach strategies that help parents support growth in child social-emotional and self-regulation competencies and prepare them for the transition into formal schooling. Recent research has expanded understanding of the neurodevelopmental processes that underlie child school readiness, and the impact of parenting (and the social ecology affecting parenting) on those processes. These new insights have fueled innovation in preschool-based efforts to partner with and support parents, expanding and shifting the focus of that programming. In addition, new approaches to intervention design and delivery are emerging to address the pervasive challenges of reaching and engaging families, especially those representing diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, a",

This research brief summarizes the latest evidence base on effective involve-ment\u2014that is, the research studies that link family involvement in early childhood to outcomes and programs that have been evaluated to show what works. The conceptual framework guiding this research review is complementary learning . Harvard Family Research Project (HFRP) believes that for children and youth to be successful from birth through adolescence, there must be an array of learning supports around them. These learning supports include families, early childhood programs, schools, out-of-school time programs and activities, higher education, health and social service agencies, businesses, libraries, museums, and other community-based institutions. HFRP calls this network of supports complementary learning. Complementary learning is characterized by discrete linkages that work together to encourage consistent learning and developmental outcomes for children. These linkages are continuously in place from birth through adolescence, but the composition and functions of this network changes over time as children m",

Yet efforts to engage parents have waned in recent years when policy and research support have focused on promoting children\u2019s school readiness skills with few resources devoted to family support services. This chapter illustrates the central role that parental involvement and engagement plays in promoting the lasting benefits of high-quality early education.

In addition to prescribing specific strategies designed to involve parents in their children\u2019s education as well as for their own personal and career development, CPC creates school infrastructure supports (e.g., small class, resource centers) to sustain family engagement and align home-based and school-based learning.

Deseret News In an age of partisan contention, federal support for making prekindergarten classes available for all toddlers seems to be gaining steam with broad bipartisan support. Universal pre-K is an integral part of President Joe Biden\u2019s policy proposals targeting families, too. But critics question whether it\u2019s the best option to close educational gaps between low-income and better-off children, or whether putting limited resources elsewhere would help struggling families and their children more..... .....Even critics agree universal pre-K would boost women\u2019s workforce participation and reduce gender-based workplace inequality. What\u2019s in question is whether the effort would provide enough long-term benefits to children to justify the cost or if expanding tax credits or offering a child allowance would help families with children more...... .....But even skeptics say studies find kids in pre-K are more ready to attend kindergarten. That means kindergarten teachers needn\u2019t spend so much time getting kids used to being in school and showing them how to behave. Plus, children will have learned basic concepts like letter formation, the alphabet, colors and shapes in preschool. Critics say those benefits don\u2019t last, a problem when society invests heavily in a program.

Abstract Public preschool programs can be universal, open to all age-eligible children, or targeted, with eligibility limited to children from lower-income families. The effects on children of targeted programs have been intensively studied in the US, with results showing substantial beneficial impacts on child development and subsequent adult outcomes for disadvantaged children. However, there is little reliable evidence on the medium and long run effects of universal preschool programs in the US. This paper reviews studies from Europe that have exploited quasi-experimental variation to estimate the causal impact of universal public preschool eligibility and enrollment on child and adult outcomes. The evidence shows that these programs provide substantial short and long run benefits to disadvantaged children, but relatively modest bene",

Could public preschool benefit your children? The school districts in Georgia and New York do, and they subsequently have created a universal preschool curriculum for four-year-old students. While many parents, teachers, and communities debate the benefits of a public-wide preschool, many states are considering mandated and/or government-supported programs for young children and families. Why the Public Preschool is Gaining Attention Political Base states: \u201cState-funded public preschool is usually a means-tested program that provides early education to 3 and 4-year-olds. The goal in providing subsidized public preschool for low-income families is to provide a stable environment for young children during a crucial age of development.\u201d Essentially, since lower-income families cannot always provide sufficient child care, \u201ctheir children would be left at home. For many, this means unstable environments and T.V.s instead of teachers. It may also force single parents to stay home to raise children instead of work.\u201d As a result of these struggles, many states are implementing government-funded schools and educational programs to provide lower-income families with added assistance. Building on this framework, the state-mandated preschool programs are also ideally intended to provide families of all financial backgrounds with more supportive educational options for c",

Download Free Ebook Today\u2019s parents are more involved than they\u2019ve ever been with their children\u2019s development. Except, it seems, when it comes to preschool. Many parents drop their kids off in the morning while the teachers take over, and then pick them up at the end of the day without giving their learning much thought. To get the true benefits from early childhood education, parents need to consider how they can support what their children are learning throughout the day. The benefits of parent involvement Some of a child\u2019s most important cognitive development happens during their preschool years. By taking an active role in the early childhood education process, parents can help ensure that their child has all the support they need to develop to their full potential. Parent involvement helps extend teaching outside the classroom, creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school. It is essential for parents to support the learning that happens in preschool settings at home as well. Parents who are in tune with what is happening in their child\u2019s preschool classroom or child care facility are better able to establish a connection between what is learned at school and what takes place in the home. This connection is a key component of a child\u2019s development and supporting further learning. Not only does family or parental involvement help extend teaching outside the classroom; it creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school.

Yet efforts to engage parents have waned in recent years when policy and research support have focused on promoting children\u2019s school readiness skills with few resources devoted to family support services. This chapter illustrates the central role that parental involvement and engagement plays in promoting the lasting benefits of high-quality early education. We describe the Child-Parent Center (CPC) program and its emphasis on facilitating productive family engagement across the early childhood years (ages 3\u20139). In addition to prescribing specific strategies designed to involve parents in their children\u2019s education as well as for their own personal and career development, CPC creates school infrastructure supports (e.g., small class, resource centers) to sustain family engagement and align home-based and school-based learning.

This research brief summarizes the latest evidence base on effective involve-ment\u2014that is, the research studies that link family involvement in early childhood to outcomes and programs that have been evaluated to show what works. The conceptual framework guiding this research review is complementary learning . Harvard Family Research Project (HFRP) believes that for children and youth to be successful from birth through adolescence, there must be an array of learning supports around them. These learning supports include families, early childhood programs, schools, out-of-school time programs and activities, higher education, health and social service agencies, businesses, libraries, museums, and other community-based institutions. HFRP calls this network of supports complementary learning. Complementary learning is characterized by discrete linkages that work together to encourage consistent learning and developmental outcomes for children. These linkages are continuously in place from birth through adolescence, but the composition and functions of this network changes over time as children m",

It recognizes the pluralistic nature of societies and encourages understanding and respect among different cultures. By linking this to personalized learning, educators can tailor educational content to fit individual backgrounds, ensuring that each child\u2019s unique cultural identity is respected and acknowledged. The importance of embracing diversity in early childhood cannot be overstated. Children begin to understand their place in the world at a young age, and exposure to various cultures helps foster a sense of empathy and inclusiveness. Connecting this to the core of personalized learning, it creates an environment where children can relate to the world and others in a way that resonates with their personal experiences and perspectives. The Principles of Multicultural Education Respect for different cultures is at the heart of multicultural education. It teaches children that every culture is unique and valuable, and it promotes an appreciation for diversity. Through personalized learning, educators can adapt their teaching strategies to honor and celebrate the individual cultural backgrounds of each child, making learning more relevant and engaging for them. Inclusivity and equality are fundamental principles of multicultural education. This approach ensures that all children, regardless of their cultural background, have an equal opportunity to learn and grow. By connecting this principle with personalized learning, education becomes more accessible and tailored to meet the specific needs and interests of each child, thus promoting fairness and equality in educational opportunit",

Children\u2019s formative years are crucial for shaping their understanding of themselves, others, and the world around them. By embracing and celebrating diversity in all its forms\u2014racial, cultural, linguistic, or ability-related\u2014educators can create inclusive spaces where every child feels valued, respected, and empowered to succeed. This article explores why celebrating diversity is vital, offers practical strategies for teachers, and highlights how focusing on inclusion benefits children and society. The Importance of Celebrating Diversity in Early Childhood Building a Foundation of Acceptance Children are naturally curious, observant, and impressionable. From a young age, they notice differences in appearance, language, and culture among their peers. Educators play a crucial role in guiding children\u2019s perceptions of these differences, turning what might otherwise be a source of confusion or misunderstanding into opportunities for learning and empathy. When diversity is celebrated, children are more likely to grow up with a mindset that values acceptance and collaboration across differences. Research has shown that children exposed to diverse environments early on tend to develop better social skills and are more adaptable in various situations. This exposure also helps reduce prejudice and discrimination later in life. By creating a classroom that actively embraces diversity, teachers help children understand that differences are not something to be feared but rather embraced as part of the richness of human experience. Promoting Cognitive and Social Development Diverse classrooms provide rich opportunities for cognitive and social development. Interacting with peers from different backgrounds allo",

From religion, gender, culture, family structures, and physical abilities, we are each brought into this world made up of many differences. For years we have thought that children will automatically form positive outlooks about the differences we each convey if we do not speak of those differences. However, research has shown that advocating and exposing children to diversity requires active promotion. Rodolfo Mendoza-Denton, a social psychologist at the University of California, says that we often think that young children are colorblind to differences, and we are hesitant to point out differences for fear that it promotes prejudice (Denton, 2011). However, numerous studies have shown that infants as young as 6 months are able to categorize people by both gender and race (Katz & Kofkin, 1997). By 2 years, toddlers use their recognition of race to reason about people\u2019s behaviors. During toddlerhood, children notice and reason about differences, but studies also show that toddlers do not act on observed differences. However, by age 5, children express preferences for their own race (Kinzler & Spelke, 2011).\u00a0 It is through daily interactions and observations of others\u2019 comments and verbal and nonverbal behaviors that young children attribute particular meaning to race, culture and other forms of diversity.\u00a0 By the late preschool years, such understandings inform behavior. By ignoring young children\u2019s attention to these differences, we as professionals unintentionally contribute to the prejudice and stereotypes that they gather from society. \u00a0In fact, y",

This was the vision behind President Obama's 2013 initiative to make universal preschool a reality. However, implementing universal preschool is a complex undertaking.

Universal Preschool: A Big Idea for Early Education In 2013, President Obama had a big idea: he wanted to make preschool available for all children in the United States.

This would help make sure that all children have the same opportunities to learn and grow.

Some experts say no. Universal prekindergarten sounds like a good thing. Early education for all! Why not? Anything for the kids. Universal pre-k already exists\u2014or is close to existing\u2014in a number of states, including Oklahoma, Florida, and, most recently, New York. And given the appeal of the idea, it\u2019s no wonder \"preschool for all\" emerged as a key talking point this election season, a year or so after President Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion federal universal pre-k program that involves partnerships with states. The promise of universal pre-k figured prominently in the 2014 campaigns of gubernatorial candidates in Pennsylvania and Maryland, among others. In Hawaii, an ultimately unsuccessful ballot initiative that would\u2019ve amended the state\u2019s constitution to allow the government to contract with private preschool providers\u2014and eventually implement a universal pre-k system\u2014was described, repeatedly, as a \"yes brainer.\" But is universal pre-k truly the panacea that politicians and advocates, including Obama, make it out to be? Not quite, researchers say\u2014although it does, as they point out, make for an effective political tool. In fact, Ron Haskins, a preschool expert who co-directs the Center on Children and Families at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, went as far as calling universal pre-k \"a very bad idea.\" Based on common sense alone, every young child should, ideally, have access to quality early-learning experiences before kindergarten, regardless of whether that kid\u2019s family can afford it. Preschool can cost as much as $1,000 a month; sometimes it costs even more. Daycare, for its part, costs more on average than college in most states. The high cost helps explain why more than half of the country\u2019s 3- and 4-year-olds miss out on preschool.

We call for the implementation of innovative, universal preschool programs that attend to developmental characteristics of learners, cultural and linguistic diversity, ecosystemic context, and the new mandates on teacher training. Universal preschool has the potential to go far beyond mere \u201cday-care,\u201d as it has the potential to establish the foundation for a lifelong love of learning and optimal social/emotional development. We also advocate for high-quality teacher training to populate preschools with high-quality teachers.

Abstract Public preschool programs can be universal, open to all age-eligible children, or targeted, with eligibility limited to children from lower-income families. The effects on children of targeted programs have been intensively studied in the US, with results showing substantial beneficial impacts on child development and subsequent adult outcomes for disadvantaged children. However, there is little reliable evidence on the medium and long run effects of universal preschool programs in the US. This paper reviews studies from Europe that have exploited quasi-experimental variation to estimate the causal impact of universal public preschool eligibility and enrollment on child and adult outcomes. The evidence shows that these programs provide substantial short and long run benefits to disadvantaged children, but relatively modest bene",

As society's understanding of early childhood education evolves, innovative ideas and initiatives are reshaping the landscape of childcare and kindergarten services. In this blog, we'll explore seven transformative trends that are driving positive change in the childcare and kindergarten sector. The play-based learning approach emphasizes the importance of play in early childhood education, recognizing it as a natural and effective way for children to explore, discover, and learn. Childcare centers and kindergartens are integrating play-based activities, such as sensory play, dramatic play, and outdoor exploration, into their curriculum to promote cognitive, social, and emotional development. By fostering creativity, problem-solving skills, and self-expression through play, educators can create engaging and meaningful learning experiences for young children. STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is gaining prominence in early childhood settings, with an emphasis on hands-on exploration, inquiry-based learning, and problem-solving skills. Childcare centers and kindergartens are incorporating STEM activities, such as building blocks, experiments, and coding games, to introduce young learners to STEM concepts in a fun and engaging way. By nurturing curiosity, critical thinking, and spatial reasoning skills, STEM education prepares children for future success in an increasingly technology-driven world. Inclusive and diversity-focused curriculum promotes equity, representation, and cultural awareness in early childhood education. Childcare centers and kindergartens are integrating diverse perspectives, multicultural literature, and inclusive activities that celebrate children's identities, backgrounds, and experiences.

As society increasingly recognizes the value of early learning, many families are eager to enroll their children in preschool programs. However, amidst the growing advocacy for ECE, it is crucial to examine the potential drawbacks associated with early schooling. Understanding these cons is essential for parents and educators in making informed decisions about a child\u2019s educational journey. While early childhood education can foster critical skills, it is not without its challenges. Concerns include limited social interactions, varying program quality, and the potential for increased stress on young learners. Families must weigh these aspects against the perceived benefits to ensure that their child\u2019s early learning experience is truly enriching and supportive. The conversation surrounding the cons of early childhood education is multifaceted. Factors such as curriculum rigidity, emotional impacts, and cultural misalignments deserve thorough consideration.

It also assists in monitoring standards and promoting educational equity. However, limitations include limited adaptability in addressing individual needs, potential impact on creativity, and a narrowed learning scope. Uniform syllabi may impede exploration of various subjects and impede critical thinking. Additionally, challenges arise for educators in managing diverse student needs under strict guidelines. Understanding these points can help in thoroughly weighing the advantages and disadvantages of uniform syllabus. Table of Contents Takeaways Advantages of Standardized Curriculum One of the key advantages of standardized syllabus is the consistency it provides in educational content across different schools and regions. By adhering to a set curriculum, students moving between schools or regions can have a smooth shift without significant variations in what they have already learned. This consistency helps guarantee that all students are exposed to the same core knowledge and skills, promoting equity in education. Standardized syllabus also facilitates easier monitoring of educational standards and outcomes. With a set curriculum in place, educators, policymakers, and parents can have a clear understanding of what students are expected to learn at each grade level. This transparency allows for more effective assessment of student progress and helps identify areas where additional support may be needed. Furthermore, a standardized syllabus can promote a sense of unity and collaboration among educators. By providing a common framework for teaching, teachers can share resources, strategies, and best practices more easily, fostering a supportive educational community dedicated to student success.

The study includes reviews of r igorous evaluations of 21 large -scale public preschool programs which find that children who attend these programs are more prepared for school and experience substantial learning gains in comparison to children who do not attend preschool. Research on early learning programs in the 1960s and 19 70s revealed that benefits for children lasted into adulthood, inspiring many states to invest in preschool programs. However, recent evaluation s of two programs \u2014Tennessee\u2019s Voluntary Pre -K program and Head Start \u2014found mixed results, leaving policymakers and the public confused about whether or not investments in preschool programs actually do make a difference to student success . LPI\u2019s new report review s these two studies and others in depth , noting that interpretations of the results often depend on the groups of students being compared. When participants are compared to others who attended similar preschools \u2013 or to a more generally advantaged comparison group \u2013 there are often not strong differences in their elementary school performance. This does not mean pre school effects \u201cfade out\u201d or that preschool is not effective; it means that the children in both groups benefit similarly.

Bierman Dr. Karen Bierman is an Evan Pugh University Professor of Psychology and Human Development and Family Studies and Director of the Child Study Center at the Pennsylvania State University. Her research focuses on school-based and family-focused interventions that promote social-emotional competence and school readiness in young children, and the long-term benefits of preschool interventions. 50 Years of Research to Improve Preschool Curricula: Is there Progress? This thoughtful and comprehensive monograph by Kimberly Nesbitt and Dale Farran (2021) comes at an opportune time for the study of curricula in early childhood education (ECE).\u00a0 Addressing the first goal of the monograph, the authors provide a valuable study of one comprehensive preschool curriculum, Tools of the Mind, illustrating a rigorous approach to evaluating the program\u2019s impact on children\u2019s school-readiness skills and on classroom teaching processes. The in-depth exploration of factors that may have diminished the intervention\u2019s effectiveness is especially noteworthy and illustrates the value of research that extends beyond outcome testing and has potential to inform future program design. The second goal of the monograph was to consider the broader question of whether the use of intentional, scripted curricula in preschools can enhance children\u2019s school readiness and school success.\u00a0 In my commentary I focus on the second of these goals. Research on preschool curriculum effectiveness is complex in ways that make it difficult to navigate and interpret, as Nesbitt and Farran describe. From the initiation of publicly funded preschool in the U.S. in 1965, the value of intentional instruction has been controversial (Chambers, Cheung, & Slavin, 2016). Contemporary prescho",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education. So what exactly is universal preschool, and what are some arguments for and against it? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at some potential pros and cons to help provide a balanced look at the topic. Viacheslav Lopatin \u00a9 123RF.com What is Universal Preschool? In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C.

Now, let\u2019s talk about universal pre-k. There is much debate surrounding universal preschool and its effects on childcare providers. On the one hand, some argue that universal preschool should be offered to all children to give them a head start in their education. On the other hand, many childcare providers in early childhood education feel that their child enrollment and business will suffer if universal pre-k is implemented. Let's dive into this topic and discuss the pros and cons of universal pre-k and how child care providers can navigate the change and ensure that their programs are not negatively impacted. So what is universal preschool? Universal preschool is a publicly funded program that provides free or low-cost preschool to all children turning 4 before a specific date in the academic calendar. Some states also serve three-year-olds. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), \"Universal pre-K means that pre-K programs are available to any child in a given state, regardless of family income, children's abilities, or other factors.\" Pros of Universal Preschool Teachers are highly qualified and must have a degree in early childhood education All children can attend States fund the program Preschool helps children develop critical social skills and sets the foundation for future learning Cons of Universal Pre-K Childcare centers, private preschools, and in-home providers lose enrollment causing financial strain Expense for states Some quality ECE teachers in child care centers may swap to the public school system How Can Childcare Providers Survive the Change?

One of the hallmarks of President Biden\u2019s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan is its ambitious proposal to create something tantamount to universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. The plan calls for a national partnership with states that, when fully implemented, could put five million children into high-quality programs and save the average American family $13,000 per year. The proposal has a long way to go before becoming a reality. And with the Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, there is a chance the program may not materialize at all. But even the prospect of universal preschool, long embraced by other developed nations, is ginning up a great deal of attention and interest from the public, especially after a hard year that has revealed to many families just how critical early care and education is to a healthy, functioning U.S. workforce, not to mention its importance for young children. Yet the proposal alone will not close critical gaps in child care and preschool, and experts warn there could be unintended consequences\u2014for families, educators and young children. That\u2019s because the landscape of modern child care operates as something of a patchwork in the U.S., and profitability (or even sustainability) can be difficult to come by. But experts say",

The discussion surrounding universal pre-K has gotten louder over the last decade. With six states currently providing this educational opportunity to young children, more states are looking to expand their policies to include preschoolers. The benefits of providing high quality education equitably to all children are well-documented. It prepares them for kindergarten and school, and helps them to lay strong foundations for their future development. The roll-out of universal pre-K and transitional kindergarten (TK) programs, though, has posed its own challenges that will need to be addressed in coming years.\u00a0 In this article, we\u2019ll discuss universal pre-K and transitional kindergarten (TK) \u2014 what it is, their benefits and drawbacks, and examples of their implementation across the country. The concept of universal pre-K Universal pre-K, also called preschool for all, is a policy framework that would provide all preschool-aged children with access to high-quality, government-funded education and care. These childcare programs would be accessible to any child, regardless of their family\u2019s financial situation or the child\u2019s abilities. The concept of universal pre-K has been around for nearly two centuries. The state of Wisconsin promised free, voluntary education for four-year-olds as early as 1848 in its constitution. With the foundation in place, it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that the idea started to gain momentum. The concept and its application could be seen taking form with a Boston preschool lottery. Mayor Thomas Menino wanted to improve Boston\u2019s public schools by providing universal, full-day kindergarten. To bypass their tight budget, the city moved resources from preschool to kindergarten. This change left a limited number of spots for city-funded preschool. Menino and the city decided to enact a lottery syste",

You may have encountered various terms like Jr. Kinder, Pre-K, Transitional Kindergarten (TK), and Kindergarten used in your geographic region.\u00a0 Regardless of the exact terminology, these programs share a common goal: to provide all children with access to free early education, usually starting around the age of four. Pre-K programs have gained significant attention as a means to level the educational playing field and provide all children, regardless of socioeconomic status, with a strong start to their educational journey. The concept is compelling: early education can address disparities before they become entrenched, setting children on a path to academic success and social-emotional development. However, the research on the efficacy of universal pre-K is mixed, and much of this ambiguity stems from the variability in the curricula employed across different programs. This article explores the evidence surrounding universal pre-K and emphasizes the critical importance of adopting a robust and research-based curriculum to maximize its benefits.

At the time of the most recent State of Preschool report in 2022, only 11 states had implemented universal pre-K policies, and only 32% of four-year-olds and 6% of three-year-olds participated in a state-funded pre-K program at all.

The design and implementation of an effective curriculum during these formative years play a pivotal role in shaping a child\u2019s cognitive, social, emotional, and physical development. There are various curriculum models tailored to the unique needs of early childhood education, each with its own set of principles and approaches. We will delve into several prominent early childhood curriculum models, exploring their key principles and their impact on young learners. \u00a0 I. Montessori Curriculum Model The Montessori curriculum model, developed by Dr. Maria Montessori, emphasises child-centered learning, independence, and self-directed exploration. Key principles of the Montessori curriculum include: Prepared Environment: Montessori classrooms are carefully designed to provide a nurturing and stimulating environment. Materials are organised and accessible to encourage independent exploration. Self-Directed Learning: Children have the freedom to choose activities that interest them, fostering a sense of autonomy and self-motivation. Mixed-Age Grouping: Montessori classrooms typically have mixed-age groups, allowing older children to mentor and younger ones to learn from their peers. Hands-On Materials: Montessori materials are designed to be hands-on and self-correcting, enabling children to learn through touch and experience. Individual Progress: Each child progresses at their own pace, ensuring that learning is tailored to their unique needs and abilities. II. Reggio Emilia Approach The Reggio Emilia approach, originating in the Reggio Emilia region of Italy, places a strong emphasis on child-initiated learning and the role of the environment as a \u201cthird teacher.\u201d Key principles of the Reggio Emilia approach include: Child-Centered Learning: Children are viewed as active constructors of their knowledge, and their interests and ideas are at the center of ",

The expansion of taxpayer-funded preschool programs aimed at all young children comes even as new research shows the educational harms that these programs can have on children. Vanderbilt University researchers have been tracking the progress and outcomes of students who participated in the Tennessee Pre-K Program, a publicly-funded preschool program overseen by the state that became fully implemented in 2005. Using a randomized control study, researchers found that, rather than improving academic outcomes, the taxpayer-funded preschool program led to worse academic outcomes for the children who participated in the program compared to the children who did not. Moreover, the negative academic outcomes became more pronounced as the years passed, and the participating students also had worse behavioral outcomes compared to the children who did not participate in the program. \u201cData through sixth grade from state education records showed that the children randomly assigned to attend pre-K had lower state achievement test scores in third through sixth grades than control children, with the strongest negative effects in sixth grade,\u201d the researchers wrote in a paper released earlier this year. \u201cA negative effect was also foun",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education.

In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C.

Universal Preschool: Lawmakers Should Approach with Caution Many proposed preschool standards are designed around institutional schooling and therefore reflect a bias toward that model. Children are not widgets. What works well for one may not work for another. That is why education is not a one-size-fits-all endeavor. When looking at preschool or K\u201312 education, having a diversity of options is essential. Yet there continue to be calls for the federal government to pass a universal preschool program like the one in President Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Act. This is clearly unconstitutional: the U.S. Constitution grants no authority over education to the federal government. But, perhaps just as important, a universal preschool program would be harmful policy. Currently, parents enjoy a wide variety of preschool options. Unfortunately, the mandates and regulations that would accompany a federal universal program would likely put many providers out of business. Smaller providers would be particularly hard-hit. The most likely to survive would be one of the less popular options: secular, center-based preschools. Furthermore, there is strong evidence that universal programs are less helpful for disadvantaged children than targeted programs, while the research is mixed as to the benefits of preschool programs of all sizes. All things considered, implementing universal preschool, with the goal of helping lower-income families, would likely be counterproductive.

Universal preschool might better be called daycare, a program for young children to socialize, have free play, and experience lovely learning-rich experiences before school. It might help parents who\u2019ve had a difficult time during the pandemic. But the term school needs examining along with its association to Head Start\u2019s standards. President Biden has said: Research shows when a young child goes to school, not daycare, they\u2019re far more likely to graduate from high school, and go to college or something after high school. This standardization worries a lot of early childhood experts who believe daycare is a better term.

One of the hallmarks of President Biden\u2019s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan is its ambitious proposal to create something tantamount to universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. The plan calls for a national partnership with states that, when fully implemented, could put five million children into high-quality programs and save the average American family $13,000 per year. The proposal has a long way to go before becoming a reality. And with the Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, there is a chance the program may not materialize at all. But even the prospect of universal preschool, long embraced by other developed nations, is ginning up a great deal of attention and interest from the public, especially after a hard year that has revealed to many families just how critical early care and education is to a healthy, functioning U.S. workforce, not to mention its importance for young children.

Some experts say no. By Alia Wong Robyn Jay/Flickr November 18, 2014 Share Save Universal prekindergarten sounds like a good thing. Early education for all! Why not? Anything for the kids. Universal pre-k already exists\u2014or is close to existing\u2014in a number of states, including Oklahoma, Florida, and, most recently, New York. And given the appeal of the idea, it\u2019s no wonder \"preschool for all\" emerged as a key talking point this election season, a year or so after President Barack Obama proposed a $75 billion federal universal pre-k program that involves partnerships with states. The promise of universal pre-k figured prominently in the 2014 campaigns of gubernatorial candidates in Pennsylvania and Maryland, among others. In Hawaii, an ultimately unsuccessful ballot initiative that would\u2019ve amended the state\u2019s constitution to allow the government to contract with private preschool providers\u2014and eventually implement a universal pre-k system\u2014was described, repeatedly, as a \"yes brainer.\" But is universal pre-k truly the panacea that politicians and advocates, including Obama, make it out to be? Not quite, researchers say\u2014although it does, as they point out, make for an effective political tool. \"Preschool has been oversold. People too often speak as if it\u2019s a certainty that preschool has strong, lasting benefits.\" In fa",

Could public preschool benefit your children? The school districts in Georgia and New York do, and they subsequently have created a universal preschool curriculum for four-year-old students. While many parents, teachers, and communities debate the benefits of a public-wide preschool, many states are considering mandated and/or government-supported programs for young children and families. Why the Public Preschool is Gaining Attention Political Base states: \u201cState-funded public preschool is usually a means-tested program that provides early education to 3 and 4-year-olds. The goal in providing subsidized public preschool for low-income families is to provide a stable environment for young children during a crucial age of development.\u201d Essentially, since lower-income families cannot always provide sufficient child care, \u201ctheir children would be left at home. For many, this means unstable environments and T.V.s instead of teachers. It may also force single parents to stay home to raise children instead of work.\u201d As a result of these struggles, many states are implementing government-funded schools and educational programs to provide lower-income families with added assistance. Building on this framework, the state-mandated preschool programs are also ideally intended to provide families of all financial backgrounds with more supportive educational options for c",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma.

Location Search The Case Against Universal Preschool universal preschool public pre-k Published Date: 09/05/19 Between 2003 and 2018, the number of 4-year-olds attending public preschool more than doubled to 33%. More and more cities and states have established or expanded programs, and several Democratic 2020 candidates have universal pre-k as a core tenet of their childcare policy. In theory, offering universal preschool has tremendous benefits. Preschool has been shown to improve children\u2019s social, emotional, and academic skills, helping to prepare them for kindergarten and beyond. Universal preschool can provide opportunities for people, especially mothers, to enter or reenter the workforce giving access to free childcare. In 2009 Washington DC ambitiously expanded their universal preschool program, offering two years of full-day preschool in public schools, public charters, and some private preschool programs administered by community-based organizations. By 2017, 70% of DC\u2019s 3-year-olds and 90% of DC\u2019s 4-year-olds were enrolled in public preschool. The maternal labor force - mothers who are employed or actively seeking work - was positively impacted. It increased by 12 percentage points, with 10 of those being attributed to the expansion universal preschool. Amazing! However, it\u2019s notable that DC has the highest cost for infant care in the country, averaging over $24,000 annually and there are only enough licensed spots to care for roughly one third of DC\u2019s 26,000+ children under three.

In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C.

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

Abstract Public preschool programs can be universal, open to all age-eligible children, or targeted, with eligibility limited to children from lower-income families. The effects on children of targeted programs have been intensively studied in the US, with results showing substantial beneficial impacts on child development and subsequent adult outcomes for disadvantaged children. However, there is little reliable evidence on the medium and long run effects of universal preschool programs in the US. This paper reviews studies from Europe that have exploited quasi-experimental variation to estimate the causal impact of universal public preschool eligibility and enrollment on child and adult outcomes. The evidence shows that these programs provide substantial short and long run benefits to disadvantaged children, but relatively modest bene",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education. So what exactly is universal preschool, and what are some arguments for and against it? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at some potential pros and cons to help provide a balanced look at the topic. Viacheslav Lopatin \u00a9 123RF.com What is Universal Preschool? In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) currently enrolls over 6000 preschool students as part of their tuition-free universal pre-K initiative, and reports that more than 92% of these students are \u201cmeeting or exceeding developmental expectations.\u201d DCPS requires that preschool teachers hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and teachers are paid a salary comparable to that of K-12 teachers. The DCPS preschool curriculum is grounded in their established Kindergarten Readiness Standards, which focus on subjects such as Social & Emotional Development, Physical Development, Language & Literacy, Mathematical Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Social Studies, and Creative Arts.

Research on early childhood education has been extensive and has demonstrated the importance of high-quality early childhood education on long-term child development and academic achievement. Recent studies, however, have shown mixed results. Much of this research was conducted several years ago in targeted and structured high-quality child care programs that included a focus on health and well-being, family engagement, and hands-on learning opportunities.

State subsidy programs simply do not meet the need. In many states, families are left lingering on waiting lists\u2014unable to work or forced to use expensive or low-quality care options. So why would states want to increase demand even further? The answer lies in the broader impact of subsidy programs. Child care subsidies do not just help an individual family. Well-funded, well-structured subsidy systems have the potential to increase supply and quality of child care for everyone, while improving educator wellbeing and stabilizing the industry as a whole. To reach this potential, however, the system must have a broader reach. In the\u00a0second blog post of this four-part series, we discussed state policy choices that can improve the supply of child care subsidy slots. In this post, we describe policy levers that can balance local supply and demand for subsidies and remove barriers to an otherwise equitable, functioning market. Adequate Funding and Expanded Eligibility Increases Subsidy Demand Participation in child care subsidy programs is not low because of lack of interest, but because of low funding and narrow eligibility. Some states have chosen to restrict the demand for subsidies by limiting the number of people who are eligible. One method used by states is to set the income threshold to near poverty. Another method is to exclude families who choose not to seek child support from noncustodial parents. Unfortunately, low participation in child care subsidy programs limits the impact of policy levers that increase child care supply. These levers become relevant to only a small number of child care slots. Reimbursing slots at the true cost of quality care, for example, cannot meaningfully stabilize program revenue if child care programs only have one or two subsidy users enrolled. To increase demand for subsidy slots, states can choose to expand both funding and eligibili",

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier.

But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.1 In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children.

DC can grow its economy through expansion of affordable child care to all families. With additional investment in its child care subsidy program, DC can offset the high cost of child care and enable parents to go to work or school while their children engage in positive early learning experiences. Helping families pay for child care, regardless of income level, would significantly boost DC\u2019s economy by removing barriers to women\u2019s participation in the workforce, freeing up family budgets to purchase more necessities from District businesses, and increasing the money child care providers have to overcome tight margins, hire more staff, and improve their facilities. DC recently expanded access to the subsidy program to more families, recognizing that investing in affordable, high-quality care can facilitate economic gains for Black and brown families, small and large businesses, and the DC economy as a whole. Increasing public funding for the DC child care subsidy program is also necessary to overcome centuries of underinvestment due to structural racism and sexism that causes child care providers to operate with less than they need and charge parents more than they can afford.[1] Currently, District residents who do not participate in the subsidy program spend, on average, 26 percent of their annual income on child care costs for one child. For the District\u2019s lowest income residents, who due to systemic racism are disproportionately Black and brown, child care can cost up to 32 percent of their annual pay.[2] Given that primary child rearing duties continue to predominantly fall on women, researchers have long found that the lack of affordable child care services outside the home holds back women from entering the labor force and keeping a steady job at family-sustaining wages.[3] In DC, the lack of child care for the youngest children (ages 0-3) costs familie",

That estimate applies to Rules Committee Print 117-18 incorporating a manager\u2019s amendment by Congressman Yarmuth. H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.1 In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law. On average, parents\u2019 employment would probably increase slightly under both programs. This document does not examine effects t",

This phenomenon is characterized by an excess of supply relative to demand, leading to an accumulation of unsold inventory and potential financial losses for producers. Key Takeaways What Causes Oversupply? Understanding oversupply necessitates an exploration of the various factors that can lead to an excess of goods in the market: Overproduction: This is the most straightforward reason for oversupply. Producers may manufacture more goods than the current market demand justifies. For instance, this can happen if they miscalculate consumer interest or overestimate future demand trends. Consumer Waiting Behavior: In technology markets, especially with products like smartphones, consumers may hold off on purchasing existing models in anticipation of the release of improved versions. This delay can lead to oversupply of the older models. Pricing Strategy: If a product is priced too high relative to its perceived value, consumers may be unwilling to purchase it, thereby creating a surplus. This imbalance highlights the significant relationship between price and demand in economic theory. Market Misalignment: Sometimes, producers may fail to accurately read market signals, resulting in an overproduction of certain goods that do not align with consumer preferences or buying capabilities. Effects of Oversupply Impact on Pricing When an oversupply occurs, the immediate effect is often a downward pressure on prices. This is due to sellers needing to offload surplus inventory. For example, if sellers cannot sell all their products at the original price, they may reduce prices to stimulate demand. As prices fall, the quantity demanded typically increases\u2014though this does not always guarantee a return to market equilibrium. Unsold Inventory An importan",

Under the current system, parents are unable to afford high child care costs, providers operate on razor-thin margins maintaining slim profits, and child care workers earn low wages and have high turnover. Furthermore, underinvestment has worsened families\u2019 access to high-quality child care options and resulted in a bleak current state of affairs, in which early childhood education is unaffordable, inaccessible, and of low quality for many families. After an examination of the child care market and its inefficiencies, the report concludes by highlighting how policies within the Build Back Better Act can mitigate market failures and build a child care system that truly works for the families who need it.\u00a0 Significant Benefits Yet Insufficient Investment\u00a0 The benefits of high-quality and inclusive early childhood education are well documented and have lasting impacts on the lives of children, parents, and the economy at large. Investments in early education are an investment into the vitality of the American economy as children who participate have healthier development, do better in school, and are less involved in crime, all of which decrease healthcare and criminal justice expenditures. Even despite the well-documented and widespread benefits of early care and education, however, the U.S. reports among the lowest amount of investment compared to other nations. The U.S. invests fewer public dollars in early childhood education and care relative to gross domestic product (GDP) than almost all developed countries \u2013 ranking 35th out of 37 countries tracked by OECD.\u00a0 Likewise, early education is an investment that benefits parents.

Branding Bar OPRE - Main Navigation Tools and Strategies for Examining the Relationship between Child Care Subsidy Policies and Trends in Child, Family, and Provider Outcomes Download Report Introduction Research Questions The Child Care Development Block Grant (CCDBG) authorizes the CCDF program, which is the primary federal funding source for child care subsidies. These subsidies help eligible families with low incomes who are working or in an education or training program access child care. In 2014, the CCDBG law was reauthorized, which included new requirements for states related to improving the health, safety, licensing, and quality of care, and created a need for increased funding. Since 2018, states and territories have received additional funding for CCDF to help address reauthorization requirements. Additionally, states have received over $50 billion in CCDBG recovery funding following the COVID-19 pandemic to stabilize and support their child care system. While there are parameters on allowable uses, states can determine how the funds are prioritized and allocated. As a result, many states are seeking guidance on how they can better understand the relationship between specific CCDF policy choices and program outcomes for children, families, and providers\u2014that is, which families and children can access child care subsidies and what types of care can they access. Key Findings and Highlights Insights from the research teams across both case studies may help other states analyze CCDF implementation.

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

State-funded pre-K and Head Start serve less than 1 in 3 age-eligible children, and quality standards remain far too low in many of these programs. The Covid-19 pandemic has only made things worse. At the current pace of progress, the United States will not reach all preschoolers with public programs before the end of the 21st Century. Without national leadership, universal high-quality pre-K will remain a dream. This fact sheet sets out one vision for how that dream can become a reality, with the federal government offering states a 50-50 match for every dollar spent on high-quality pre-K for all children under 200 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL). We estimated the annual cost to the federal and state and local governments of a plan that enrolls all 3- and 4-year-olds under 200% of FPL in high-quality public pre-K within 20 years and all 3\u2019s and 4\u2019s in another 10 years. Our estimates are based on an average cost per child of $12,500 to fund full-day (6 hours, 180 days) pre-K that meets all ten of NIEER\u2019s Quality Standards Benchmarks and pays teaching staff on par with their K-12 peers. Current state-funded pre-K expenditure is at least $10.5 billion. The proposed federal and state/local partnership adds modest amounts of funding each year to allow the system time to build high quality. Low-income children are added first though state and local governments can of course move more quickly to serve all children regardless of income \u2014as some already do\u2014with their own resources. Figure 1 shows the estimated annual cost of expanding preschool in each of the next four school years (SY21-SY24). The cumulative cost of expanding preschool in the next 4 years is $21 billion (in current dollars), with the federal share totaling $7.7 billion and state and local share totaling $13.3 billion.

Funding Streams Specifically for Early Childhood Education and Care Allows Funding for Early Childhood Education and Care Tax Credits Table of Federal Funding for Child Care and Early Childhood Education Key Takeaways There are many federal funding streams that can support child care access and affordability, creating a patchwork system of funding. The federal government has several different approaches to providing funding for child care and early childhood, with state involvement varying significantly across programs. Child care and early childhood education are always top of mind for parents, but over the last few years these topics have emerged as a priority of state legislatures and federal policymakers. Concerns about access, affordability and workforce shortages were widespread during the pandemic and have remained a persistent issue across the states. While many states have taken action to address child care needs, the federal government remains a key source of funding for child care and early education programs. Several longstanding federal programs support access to child care and early childhood education, which span multiple federal agencies and take a wide variety of approaches to supporting children and families. Many federal programs complement state efforts, but the patchwork nature of federal child care funding can make it difficult for states to understand the full range of funding sources. Some federal funding streams are specific to child care and early childhood, such as the Preschool Development Grants Birth Through Five (PDG B-5). In fiscal year 2024,",

This paper combines information related to distributed systems and database application practices, and HBase, a distributed data storage system, is selected as the research object. The relationship between hardware configuration parameters and the throughput and response latency of HBase is modeled using the random forest algorithm, an improved particle swarm algorithm is designed and implemented to optimize the mathematical model of the relationship between resource allocation and capital cost, and the optimization results are verified in a real environment to realize the optimization of HBase resource allocation scheme. In this paper, duplicate solution sets are removed based on the objective function in the resource allocation model. Finally, NSGA-II is compared with SPEA2, MOEA/D, and IBEA in this model for simulation experiments to verify the efficient solution of NSGA-II to the constructed model through subjectivity presentation as well as objective performance analysis and to provide a decision solution with a theoretical support for resource allocation optimization.

Through the shared resource matrix analysis method, the symmetry of the matrix about this educational resource is judged so that the resource can transmit information implicitly among all subjects. The difference between noise and preschool education resource data points is enhanced using the K-nearest neighbor search algorithm. Combined with the ant colony particle swarm optimization algorithm, the sharing sequence and time of the optimal preschool education resources are calculated, and a preschool education resource-sharing platform is constructed. To verify the applicability of the constructed platform, the simulation analysis results show that the resource search accuracy of the platform constructed in this paper reaches 94.51% on average, and the compatibility performance index is as high as 7.287vw, which is 3.25vw and 3.421vw higher compared to other platforms, respectively. The results show that the matrix model can eliminate resource heterogeneity and provide convenient and efficient interactive technical support for constructing a preschool education resource-sharing platform.

View Document264 KB Summary H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates. In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law. On average, parents\u2019 employment would probably in",

Now, let\u2019s talk about universal pre-k. There is much debate surrounding universal preschool and its effects on childcare providers. On the one hand, some argue that universal preschool should be offered to all children to give them a head start in their education. On the other hand, many childcare providers in early childhood education feel that their child enrollment and business will suffer if universal pre-k is implemented. Let's dive into this topic and discuss the pros and cons of universal pre-k and how child care providers can navigate the change and ensure that their programs are not negatively impacted. So what is universal preschool? Universal preschool is a publicly funded program that provides free or low-cost preschool to all children turning 4 before a specific date in the academic calendar. Some states also serve three-year-olds. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), \"Universal pre-K means that pre-K programs are available to any child in a given state, regardless of family income, children's abilities, or other factors.\" Pros of Universal Preschool Teachers are highly qualified and must have a degree in early childhood education All children can attend States fund the program Preschool helps children develop critical social skills and sets the foundation for future learning Cons of Universal Pre-K Childcare centers, private preschools, and in-home providers lose enrollment causing financial strain Expense for states Some quality ECE teachers in child care centers may swap to the public school system How Can Childcare Providers Survive the Change?

Last week, Colorado became the latest state to pass a universal preschool program that also establishes a new, statewide Department of Early Childhood. The expansion of taxpayer-funded preschool programs aimed at all young children comes even as new research shows the educational harms that these programs can have on children. Vanderbilt University researchers have been tracking the progress and outcomes of students who participated in the Tennessee Pre-K Program, a publicly-funded preschool program overseen by the state that became fully implemented in 2005. Using a randomized control study, researchers found that, rather than improving academic outcomes, the taxpayer-funded preschool program led to worse academic outcomes for the children who participated in the program compared to the children who did not. Moreover, the negative academic outcomes became more pronounced as the years passed, and the participating students also had worse behavioral outcomes compared to the children who did not participate in the program. \u201cData through sixth grade from state education records showed that the children randomly assigned to attend pre-K had lower state achievement test scores in third through sixth grades than control children, with the strongest negative effects in sixth grade,\u201d the researchers wrote in a paper released earlier this year. \u201cA negative effect was also foun",

Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses a Threat to Some Early Childhood Ed Providers Please try again Universal preschool is coming to California in 2025, a major victory, years in the making for early childhood education advocates. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest thing we\u2019ve ever done in California for our youngest learners,\u201d said Assemblymember Kevin McCarty, a Sacramento Democrat who led the push for universal preschool in California during the last decade. McCarty is the architect of the $2.7 billion initiative, which was authorized as part of an education funding bill signed into law in July. The program, called universal transitional kindergarten, will be gradually phased in over the next five years on public school campuses, expanding existing TK classrooms until it covers all 4-year-olds in the state. By the 2025-26 school year, at full implementation, the program is expected to benefit 300,000 children, according to McCarty\u2019s office. \u201cThis is a game changer,\u201d McCarty said. But Makinya Ward is not celebrating. As a new mother, the San Leandro resident struggled to find quality preschool for her children. She wanted them to grow and develop through play, and also be nurtured by caring teachers. When she couldn\u2019t find a suitable child care center, Ward started her own in 2009. Bri Davis helps",

While private childcare remains to be the primary option available in many areas of the U.S., cities like Washington D.C., New York City, Chicago, and soon Portland, have all incorporated a universal approach to preschool education. So what exactly is universal preschool, and what are some arguments for and against it? In this article, we\u2019ll take a brief look at some potential pros and cons to help provide a balanced look at the topic. Viacheslav Lopatin \u00a9 123RF.com What is Universal Preschool? In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C. Public Schools (DCPS) currently enrolls over 6000 preschool students as part of their tuition-free universal pre-K initiative, and reports that more than 92% of these students are \u201cmeeting or exceeding developmental expectations.\u201d DCPS requires that preschool teachers hold at least a bachelor\u2019s degree, and teachers are paid a salary comparable to that of K-12 teachers. The DCPS preschool curriculum is grounded in their established Kindergarten Readiness Standards, which focus on subjects such as Social & Emotional Development, Physical Development, Language & Literacy, Mathematical Thinking, Scientific Inquiry, Social Studies, and Creative Arts.

Funding Streams Specifically for Early Childhood Education and Care Allows Funding for Early Childhood Education and Care Tax Credits Table of Federal Funding for Child Care and Early Childhood Education Key Takeaways There are many federal funding streams that can support child care access and affordability, creating a patchwork system of funding. The federal government has several different approaches to providing funding for child care and early childhood, with state involvement varying significantly across programs. Child care and early childhood education are always top of mind for parents, but over the last few years these topics have emerged as a priority of state legislatures and federal policymakers. Concerns about access, affordability and workforce shortages were widespread during the pandemic and have remained a persistent issue across the states. While many states have taken action to address child care needs, the federal government remains a key source of funding for child care and early education programs. Several longstanding federal programs support access to child care and early childhood education, which span multiple federal agencies and take a wide variety of approaches to supporting children and families. Many federal programs complement state efforts, but the patchwork nature of federal child care funding can make it difficult for states to understand the full range of funding sources. Some federal funding streams are specific to child care and early childhood, such as the Preschool Development Grants Birth Through Five (PDG B-5). In fiscal year 2024,",

The Impact of Universal Preschool on the Childcare Sector in Oklahoma and Georgia The success of any governmental subsidy depends on whether it increases or crowds out existing consumption. Yet to date there has been little empirical evidence, particularly in the education sector, on whether government intervention crowds out private provision. Universal preschool policies introduced in Georgia and Oklahoma offer an opportunity to investigate the impact of government provision and government funding on provision of childcare. Using synthetic control group difference-in-difference and interrupted time series estimation frameworks, we examine the effects of universal preschool on childcare providers. In both states there is an increase in the amount of formal childcare. While there is no crowd-out in Oklahoma, some of the government subsidized preschool in Georgia replaces childcare that would have occurred otherwise. We find the largest positive effects on provision in the most rural areas, a finding that may help direct policymaking efforts aimed at expanding childcare.

Updated: Apr 20 Choosing the right preschool for your child is a significant decision that can impact their early educational experience and future academic success. One of the critical considerations parents face is whether to opt for a public or private preschool. In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore the factors to consider when making this decision and weigh the advantages and disadvantages of both options. Understanding Public Preschools: Public preschools are government-funded educational institutions offering early childhood education programs for eligible children at no cost. Here are some key factors to consider when evaluating public preschools. Accessibility and Affordability: One of the primary advantages of public preschools is their accessibility and affordability. Since the government funds them, public preschools typically offer educational programs at no cost to families. This makes them accessible to children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, ensuring that all children have the opportunity to receive early childhood education. Standardized Curriculum: Public preschools often follow a standardized curriculum mandated by state or district guidelines. This curriculum is designed to meet specific educational standards and objectives, ensuring consistency and alignment with broader educational goals. While this standardized approach may lack the flexibility of private preschools, it provides a structured learning environment that prepares children for future academic success. Inclusive Enrollment Policies: Public preschools prioritize inclusive enrollment policies, welcoming children from diverse backgrounds, abilities, and socioeconomic statuses. This diversity fosters a rich learning environment and promotes socialization, empathy, and cultural awareness among students. Additionally, public",

Private Preschool vs. Public Preschool: Does It Matter? Nov 15, 2023 Quality,\u00a0Cost & Expenses,\u00a0Education & Development (912 Preview) When it comes to choosing a preschool for your child, there are several options available. Two of the most popular choices are private and public preschools. Private preschools are typically run by independent organizations, while public preschools are part of the public school system. But does it really matter which one you choose? Research has shown that attending preschool can have a significant impact on a child's social, emotional, and academic development. Preschool can help children develop important skills like communication, problem-solving, and cooperation. It can also help them prepare for kindergarten and future academic success. However, the quality of the preschool experience can vary greatly depending on the program's curriculum, teacher qualifications, and resources. Parents should prioritize finding a high-quality preschool, whether it's private or public, to ensure their child has the best possible start to their education. A high-quality preschool experience can set the foundation for a lifetime of learning and success. Private Preschool vs. Public Preschool Private preschools are typically run by independent organizations, while public preschools are part of the public school system. The main difference between the two is that private preschools are funded by tuition and private donations, while public preschools are funded by taxpayer dollars. There are several factors to consider when deciding between private and public preschools, including cost, curriculum, teacher qualifications, and more. When considering the type of preschool to enroll your child in, it is important to take into account the different educational philosophies and approaches that are available. Private presch",

Free preschool is the exception in the U.S. Here's how experts say you can find programs near you and advocate for universal pre-K. Many parents assume they\u2019ll send their children to preschool before kindergarten. After all, vast amounts of research shows that preschool, also sometimes called pre-K, benefits kids socially, emotionally, physically and cognitively. It helps prepare them for school and exposes them to new ways of interacting with the world. It can even result in better health outcomes and lower rates of crime and teen pregnancy, studies say. Sadly, many parents get a rude awakening when they learn that preschool in America isn\u2019t free for all students.\u00a0 While some cities and states have been rolling out free pre-K programs, in many areas, free programs are typically only available to low-income families, if at all, says Dr. Danielle Twigg, founder of Little Bird Consulting, an early childhood education consulting service.\u00a0Instead, many parents have little choice but to pay for public or private preschool programs, which may not be financially possible, even for middle class families. So, what\u2019s a parent to do? Here\u2019s the inside scoop on why preschool is so beneficial, the state of free pre-K programs in the U.S. and how to find and advocate for preschool programs that fit your budget. The importance of preschool education Putting your child in a preschool program the year before kindergarten has countless benefits, Twigg says. \u201cFrom the very start, it\u2019s usually the children\u2019s first introduction to a more formal, structured school setting,\u201d she explains, and social and emotional learning are the core focus. Here are just some of the skills kids typically learn in pre-K, according to Twigg: Preschool also helps get kids used to a routine and the expectations of school-like behavior, such as lining up or transitioning from one activity to the next.

In a broad sense, universal preschool (or universal Pre-K) is a publicly funded and tuition-free program for age-eligible children (usually 3- and 4-year olds), regardless of income level or other factors. As an example, the Portland Universal Preschool legislation text provides a general idea of what such a model may entail. Washington D.C.

The discussion surrounding universal pre-K has gotten louder over the last decade. With six states currently providing this educational opportunity to young children, more states are looking to expand their policies to include preschoolers. The benefits of providing high quality education equitably to all children are well-documented. It prepares them for kindergarten and school, and helps them to lay strong foundations for their future development. The roll-out of universal pre-K and transitional kindergarten (TK) programs, though, has posed its own challenges that will need to be addressed in coming years.\u00a0 In this article, we\u2019ll discuss universal pre-K and transitional kindergarten (TK) \u2014 what it is, their benefits and drawbacks, and examples of their implementation across the country.

These childcare programs would be accessible to any child, regardless of their family\u2019s financial situation or the child\u2019s abilities. The concept of universal pre-K has been around for nearly two centuries. The state of Wisconsin promised free, voluntary education for four-year-olds as early as 1848 in its constitution. With the foundation in place, it wasn\u2019t until the 1990s that the idea started to gain momentum. The concept and its application could be seen taking form with a Boston preschool lottery. Mayor Thomas Menino wanted to improve Boston\u2019s public schools by providing universal, full-day kindergarten.

Government programs for early childhood education have expanded in recent decades. Two states illustrate this trend. Georgia expanded its preschool program to all age-eligible residents in 1995, enabling money from the state government to follow children to the government-certified provider of their parents' choice. Oklahoma adopted universal preschool in 1998, offering it through the state's existing public school system. As one would expect, these different subsidy methods led to substantial differences in the market for childcare. In Does State Preschool Crowd-out Private Provision? The Impact of Universal Preschool on the Childcare Sector in Oklahoma and Georgia (NBER Working Paper No. 18605), Daphna Bassok, Susanna Loeb, and Maria Fitzpatrick analyze the effect of these expansions in universal preschool for 4-year-olds in Georgia and Oklahoma, both on the total amount of formal childcare provided and on the outcomes for public-versus-private childcare providers. They find that in both states, new publicly funded childcare centers tended to increase the total number of childcare providers, indicating that government intervention can increase preschool use. In Georgia, where universal preschool mandated 6.5 hours of daycare and cost $4,298 per child in 2010-11, the childcare sector expanded by 25 percent.

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

Georgia's Pre-Kindergarten program allowed students to enroll in either public or private preschools, and the observed expansion of childcare occurred in both the public and private sectors. The majority of the participants in the publicly funded preschool program enrolled in public or private centers that were in operation before the new mandate took effect. In Oklahoma, where about 90 percent of the universal preschool slots are provided through the public school system, both half (2.5 hour) and full (6 hour) days are allowed. Average spendin",

These labor productivity effects show up much later. Preschool also provides childcare and thereby increases labor force participation for certain lower-income households that show up earlier. Universal public childcare produces immediate gains in aggregate labor productivity and boosts GDP 0.2 percent above the current policy baseline in 2031. But by 2051, additional public debt crowds out private investment, and GDP is 0.2 percent below baseline even at low borrowing rates. Means-tested targeted childcare reduces the program\u2019s cost while still increasing labor supply and productivity, such that GDP increases by 0.3 percent in 2031. By 2051, GDP is larger than baseline by 0.1 percent. Economic Effects from Preschool and Childcare Programs Each person in the economy has a level of labor productivity, which along with capital, technology, and hours worked determines that individual\u2019s output and income. An individual\u2019s labor productivity is determined by factors such as innate ability, work experience, network effects and opportunities, and human capital investments such as education and job training. Although initial labor productivity is affected by influences such as family background, education, and innate ability, an individual\u2019s labor productivity evolves during their life cycle. Productivity tends to rise as a worker ages and acquires useful experience, usually peaks in late middle age, and declines until retirement. Unforeseen positive and negative shocks also affect labor productivity and earnings--events such as promotions, accidents, lucky opportunities, and so on. Higher labor productivity has a direct benefit for the individual, who can earn more and accumulate more wealth over time. Improved labor productivity for a significant portion of the workforce also raises overall wages in the economy. That effect occurs because a more productive workfo",

One of the hallmarks of President Biden\u2019s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan is its ambitious proposal to create something tantamount to universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. The plan calls for a national partnership with states that, when fully implemented, could put five million children into high-quality programs and save the average American family $13,000 per year. The proposal has a long way to go before becoming a reality. And with the Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, there is a chance the program may not materialize at all. But even the prospect of universal preschool, long embraced by other developed nations, is ginning up a great deal of attention and interest from the public, especially after a hard year that has revealed to many families just how critical early care and education is to a healthy, functioning U.S. workforce, not to mention its importance for young children. Yet the proposal alone will not close critical gaps in child care and preschool, and experts warn there could be unintended consequences\u2014for families, educators and young children. That\u2019s because the landscape of modern child care operates as something of a patchwork in the U.S., and profitability (or even sustainability) can be difficult to come by. But experts say",

May 2, 2024 Early education programs are widely believed to be effective public investments for helping children succeed in school and for reducing income- and race-based achievement gaps. However, a new groundbreaking study conducted by a team of investigators from the University of Virginia; Teachers College, Columbia University; University of California-Irvine; and the University of Delaware finds mixed evidence on the long-term effectiveness of today\u2019s preschool programs for helping children succeed in school. The study, \u201cUnsettled Science on longer-run effects of early education,\u201d published in Science Magazine, examined published evaluations of well-established, publicly funded preschool programs using rigorous designs. The four evaluations reported a mix of positive, negative, and no differences in the school performance of children who did and did not attend preschool programs in elementary school and beyond. This study challenges prevalent assumptions within the field, emphasizing the importance of identifying the key factors that foster the development of skills crucial for success in both academic endeavors and life, particularly among children from disadvantaged backgrounds. \u201cPreschool programs have long been hailed as effective interventions, yet our study reveals a more nuanced reality,\u201d says senior author of the study Margaret Burchinal, research professor in the University of Virginia Center for Advanced Study of Teaching and Learning. \u201cWhile many presume their positive impact, rigorous evaluations show a mix of outcomes, including both successes and setbacks and, in some cases, no discernible long-term effects.

Research shows that high-quality preschool programs greatly benefit parents and children. For parents, reliable pre-kindergarten systems make it easier to work full-time. These programs boost school readiness and set children up for long-term success. The positive effects of early education go far beyond the classroom, leading to a stronger workforce and a healthier economy.\u00a0 One solution is universal preschool that is publicly funded and offered to all workers in the area. One of the biggest benefits of universal preschool is how it helps parents, especially mothers, enter and stay in the workforce. Washington, D.C., is an excellent example of this. The city started offering two years of free, full-day preschool in 2009, leading to a big increase in the number of mothers working. From 2008 to 2016, the participation rate for working mothers jumped by 15 percentage points for those living below the poverty line and 13 points for those in higher income brackets. Washington, D.C., now has the highest rate of working mothers in the country, showing that access to early education is a game-changer for families. High-quality preschool programs do more than prepare kids for kindergarten\u2014they set the stage for a lifetime of success. Children attending preschool are more likely to graduate from high school, attend college, and positively contribute to society. For communities, this means a stronger workforce and a more productive economy. These programs help ensure that all children, no matter their background, have the tools to succeed in school and life.

For this reason, efforts to engage families in meaningful collaboration is a long-standing goal of high-quality early childhood education (ECE). Family\u2013school engagement can take multiple forms; in this review, we focus on universal preschool-based outreach strategies that help parents support growth in child social-emotional and self-regulation competencies and prepare them for the transition into formal schooling. Recent research has expanded understanding of the neurodevelopmental processes that underlie child school readiness, and the impact of parenting (and the social ecology affecting parenting) on those processes. These new insights have fueled innovation in preschool-based efforts to partner with and support parents, expanding and shifting the focus of that programming. In addition, new approaches to intervention design and delivery are emerging to address the pervasive challenges of reaching and engaging families, especially those representing diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, a",

This research brief summarizes the latest evidence base on effective involve-ment\u2014that is, the research studies that link family involvement in early childhood to outcomes and programs that have been evaluated to show what works. The conceptual framework guiding this research review is complementary learning . Harvard Family Research Project (HFRP) believes that for children and youth to be successful from birth through adolescence, there must be an array of learning supports around them. These learning supports include families, early childhood programs, schools, out-of-school time programs and activities, higher education, health and social service agencies, businesses, libraries, museums, and other community-based institutions. HFRP calls this network of supports complementary learning. Complementary learning is characterized by discrete linkages that work together to encourage consistent learning and developmental outcomes for children. These linkages are continuously in place from birth through adolescence, but the composition and functions of this network changes over time as children m",

Download Free Ebook Today\u2019s parents are more involved than they\u2019ve ever been with their children\u2019s development. Except, it seems, when it comes to preschool. Many parents drop their kids off in the morning while the teachers take over, and then pick them up at the end of the day without giving their learning much thought. To get the true benefits from early childhood education, parents need to consider how they can support what their children are learning throughout the day. The benefits of parent involvement Some of a child\u2019s most important cognitive development happens during their preschool years. By taking an active role in the early childhood education process, parents can help ensure that their child has all the support they need to develop to their full potential. Parent involvement helps extend teaching outside the classroom, creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school. It is essential for parents to support the learning that happens in preschool settings at home as well. Parents who are in tune with what is happening in their child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preschool classroom or child care facility are better able to establish a connection between what is learned at school and what takes place in the home. This connection is a key component of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development and supporting further learning. Not only does family or parental involvement help extend teaching outside the classroom; it creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school. Having a parent communication app such as HiMama can help with ensuring parent\u2019s are kept up to date with the learning outcomes and milestones being reached in their children\u2019s classroom.\u00c2\u00a0 What Role Can Parents Play in Early Childhood Education?

Parents (N = 704) of children participating in the Chicago Longitudinal Study were interviewed retrospectively about their school involvement in preschool and kindergarten. Parents reported on the activities in which they participated and their frequency of program participation. Results indicated that even after controlling for family background, the number of activities in which parents participated in preschool and kindergarten was significantly associated with higher reading achievement, with lower rates of grade retention at age 14 (eighth grade), and with fewer years in special education. The frequency of parent involvement was only marginally associated with reading achievement but was associated with lower rates of grade retention and fewer years in special education. A confirmatory analysis indicated that teacher ratings of parent involvement in first and second grade were significantly associated with higher reading achievement in eighth grade, lower grade retention rates, and lower rates of special education placement through eighth grade. Findings support the benefits of parent involvement in early childhood programs. Section snippets Parent Involvement in Children's Education Parental involvement in children's educati",

Fewer three year olds are enrolled in preschool. To investigate the importance of enrollment duration, this study is the first to estimate long-term dosage effects of years of preschool. We use data from a cohort of 1,500 students in the Chicago Longitudinal Study who enrolled in the Chicago Public Schools in the mid-1980s. Many of these students participated in a high-quality preschool program called Child-Parent Centers (CPC) for one or two years. To address selection with multiple treatments, we employ inverse propensity score weighting. Relative to children who attended one year of CPC preschool, the two-year group is significantly less likely to receive special education or be abused or neglected or to commit crimes. The findings provide support for the long-term benefits of greater exposure to preschool. Introduction N",

River Parkway, Minneapolis, MN, 55455. Michelle Englund can be contacted at englu008@umn.edu, Mallory Warner-Richter can be contacted at mwr@umn.edu, and Arthur Reynolds can be contacted at ajr@umn.edu Abstract This longitudinal study investigated the process whereby early parent involvement in preschool effects student achievement from kindergarten through 6th grade. Participants were 1,539 low-income, mainly African American children and their mothers, in the Chicago Longitudinal Study. Program children (N = 989) received one or two years of the Child-Parent Center (CPC) program \u2013 a preschool intervention that strongly promoted parents' development of parent involvement skills within the school and at home. Children from similar backgrounds who did not attend the CPC, but participated in available local resources (e.g. day care), were obtained as a comparison group (N = 550). Path analysis revealed an interactive process between parent involvement, academic achievement, and children's motivation. Early parent involvement directly influenced kindergarten achievement, which in turn influenced first grade student motivation. Highly motivated children then encouraged parents to continue involvement. The cyclic nature of this process across elementary school was observed. The model accounted for 61% of the variance in 6th grade achievement. Findings sug",

Extensive research indicates that parental involvement plays a more influential role in a child's academic success compared to socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or educational background. However, a noticeable gap exists between the desired and actual levels of parental involvement, often attributed to identifiable barriers. This study aims to delineate these obstacles and proposes cost-effective, actionable steps to overcome them. We introduce specific strategies that enhance the home-school partnership and recommend that schools actively teach and promote these activities. These practices highlight the dual importance of parental support for school-based learning and school support for home-based activities.

This is an open access article under the CC BY license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract This paper examines the impact on parent involvement in second grade in the Midwest Child-Parent Centers (MCPC), a high-quality preschool-to-third-grade school reform model. A new focus of research on early childhood programs is understanding how early childhood learning gains can be sustained. Two-generation programs that provide diverse family services may be one approach. The MCPC expansion was implemented for a cohort of over 2000 Chicago and Saint Paul students beginning in preschool. Based on a comparison of the program and usual-service comparison groups matched at the school level via propensity scores, ratings were obtained for a subset of the sample by teachers and parents on parent involvement in school in second grade. After accounting for potential attrition bias via multiple imputation and propensity score weighting, results indicated that MCPC participation was associated with significantly higher parent involvement in school at the end of second grade both in the aggregate sample (Effect Size\u00a0=\u00a00.19 SD) and in Chicago (ES\u00a0=\u00a00.24).

Family engagement helps children feel connected to their caregivers, families, and communities. Children who are connected feel safe, secure, supported, and are ready to learn. Family engagement helps parents and caregivers feel connected and tuned in to their children and communities as well. According to the Georgia Department of Early Care and Learning (DECAL), with more than 80,000 children enrolled in Georgia Pre-K and more than 11,000 early care and learning settings in Georgia, the factors related to family engagement are critical. Administrators and programs need support from families to facilitate this engagement. Georgia is one of 17 states that require pre-K to include family engagement activities, and one of 18 states that has a designated representative to oversee family engagement activities at the state level. Family engagement during early childhood education\u2014and in Georgia the first engagement\u2014often occurs during pre-K.

Abstract Because children from low-income families benefit from preschool but are less likely than other children to enroll, identifying factors that promote their enrollment can support research and policy aiming to reduce socioeconomic disparities in education. In this study, we tested an accommodations model with data on 6,250 children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. In general, parental necessity (e.g., maternal employment) and human capital considerations (e.g., maternal education) most consistently predicted preschool enrollment among children from low-income families. Supply side factors (e.g., local child care options) and more necessity and human capital factors (e.g., having fewer children, desiring preparation for school) selected such children into preschool over parental care or other care arrangements, and several necessity factors (e.g., being less concerned about costs) selected them into non-Head Start preschools over Head Start programs. Systemic connections and child elicitation did not consistently predict preschool enrollment in this population.

The school districts in Georgia and New York do, and they subsequently have created a universal preschool curriculum for four-year-old students. While many parents, teachers, and communities debate the benefits of a public-wide preschool, many states are considering mandated and/or government-supported programs for young children and families. Why the Public Preschool is Gaining Attention Political Base states: As a result of these struggles, many states are implementing government-funded schools and educational programs to provide lower-income families with added assistance. Building on this framework, the state-mandated preschool programs are also ideally intended to provide families of all financial backgrounds with more supportive educational options for children of a younger age. The Benefits of Preschool One of the most significant benefits of publicly mandated preschool programs is ensuring that lower-income families have opportunities to enroll their children in early education programs while saving on the often expensive costs of preschool and childcare programs. As policy analyst Darcy Ann Olsen also supports, \u201cMost advocates of public preschool argue that early schooling of low-income children is an investment that pays off in the long term by reducing the number of children who will perform poorly in school, become teenage parents, commit criminal acts, or depend on welfare. Other advocates of public preschool see it as a way to subsidize child care.\u201d This video entitled Make the Most of Every Minute in Your Preschool Program gives us an overview of what's involved in a preschool program. To ameliorate these widespread social issues of lower-income family access to resources, education, and child care, the early education program \u201cHead Start,\u201d formed in 1965, has helped provide researchers with insight into the advantages of early education programs for young kids. \u201cHead Start\u201d has provided child care and educa",

But while the federal plan hasn\u2019t happened, government-supported preschool is alive, recovering from the recession, and growing again at the state level. Preschool investment is increasing in large states, such as California and New York, and many more states are applying for $250 million in federal Preschool Development and Expansion Grants. Policymakers should ask three central questions when considering preschool expansion: 1. What makes a preschool high quality, and does it matter? Longitudinal studies show that over the long term, child development programs improve school attendance, raise school achievement, and, ultimately, reduce juvenile crime. Children who participate make significant gains in language, math and science. But dramatic results have been found only for high quality programs, such as the\u00a0Chicago Child Parent Centers\u00a0and the\u00a0Abbott Preschool Program in New Jersey, which feature teachers formally prepared to provide instruction in early education settings, classes of no more than 20 with at least one teacher and an associate teacher, parent involvement, and teachers paid what their K-6 counterparts make. 2. Should public funds for preschool be free to all 4-year-olds or limited to those from low-income families? Income-eligibility rules for federal- and state-funded preschool programs are often arbitrary; so many children whose families can\u2019t afford a good quality private preschool can\u2019t find spots for their children. Better planning is needed to ensure that quality programs reach the most disadvantaged children. New Jersey\u2019s Abbott Preschool Program offers one approach: providing free, high-quality preschool to ALL 4-year-olds in the state\u2019s 31 poorest school districts, where about a quarter of the state\u2019s preschool population lives.

See Congressional Budget Office, \u201cEstimated Budgetary Effects of Title II, Committee on Education and Labor, H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act\u201d (November 17, 2021), www.cbo.gov/publication/57622. That estimate applies to Rules Committee Print 117-18 incorporating a manager\u2019s amendment by Congressman Yarmuth. H.R. 5376, the Build Back Better Act, as passed by the House of Representatives, would expand federal subsidies for child care and provide universal preschool at no cost for eligible children. Those provisions would increase federal deficits by $381.5 billion from 2022 to 2031, the Congressional Budget Office estimates.1 In addition to the effects on the federal budget, those provisions would affect child care workers (including preschool teachers) and families with children. This document describes the key channels through which those changes could affect the economy\u2014answering some questions asked by Members of Congress. Understanding those channels would be important for identifying any potential effects on the agency\u2019s economic forecast if those provisions were enacted. The document also describes channels through which short-term spending on child care and preschool could affect the labor market in the longer run and how those policies would interact with existing tax subsidies for child care. If subsidies were expanded and preschool was universally provided, child care providers and preschools would hire more workers, boosting wages. Some parents would work more and some would work less, depending on the ages of their children, their income, their employment status, and their child care choices under current law. On average, parents\u2019 employment would probably increase slightly under both programs. This document does not examine effects t",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

One of the hallmarks of President Biden\u2019s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan is its ambitious proposal to create something tantamount to universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds. The plan calls for a national partnership with states that, when fully implemented, could put five million children into high-quality programs and save the average American family $13,000 per year. The proposal has a long way to go before becoming a reality. And with the Senate split evenly between Democrats and Republicans, there is a chance the program may not materialize at all. But even the prospect of universal preschool, long embraced by other developed nations, is ginning up a great deal of attention and interest from the public, especially after a hard year that has revealed to many families just how critical early care and education is to a healthy, functioning U.S. workforce, not to mention its importance for young children. Yet the proposal alone will not close critical gaps in child care and preschool, and experts warn there could be unintended consequences\u2014for families, educators and young children. That\u2019s because the landscape of modern child care operates as something of a patchwork in the U.S., and profitability (or even sustainability) can be difficult to come by. But experts say",

Many parents drop their kids off in the morning while the teachers take over, and then pick them up at the end of the day without giving their learning much thought.

The benefits of parent involvement Some of a child\u2019s most important cognitive development happens during their preschool years. By taking an active role in the early childhood education process, parents can help ensure that their child has all the support they need to develop to their full potential. Parent involvement helps extend teaching outside the classroom, creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school. It is essential for parents to support the learning that happens in preschool settings at home as well. Parents who are in tune with what is happening in their child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preschool classroom or child care facility are better able to establish a connection between what is learned at school and what takes place in the home. This connection is a key component of a child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s development and supporting further learning. Not only does family or parental involvement help extend teaching outside the classroom; it creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school.

Here\u2019s why active family involvement in early childhood education is crucial for children, families, and educators alike. 1. Boosts Children's Developmental Outcomes When families actively engage in their child\u2019s education, children experience significant developmental benefits. Studies show that when parents and caregivers participate in school activities, communicate regularly with teachers, and extend learning into the home, children perform better academically and socially. Family engagement supports children's cognitive development, language skills, and emotional well-being, giving them the tools to succeed in school and beyond. 2. Strengthens Parent-Child Relationships The early years are critical for establishing strong, positive relationships between children and their families. Family involvement in educational activities, such as reading together or discussing daily lessons, strengthens the bond between parents and children. This not only enhances the child\u2019s self-esteem but also encourages open communication, fostering trust and emotional security in the home. 3. Creates Consistency Between Home and School Children thrive when they experience consistency in their environments. When families and educators work together, it creates a seamless connection between home and school. Shared goals and expectations help children feel secure and supported in both settings. Family engagement ensures that the learning process is not confined to the classroom, as parents reinforce lessons and values learned in school, contributing to a well-rounded development. 4.

Early childhood education is a critical period that can shape a child\u2019s future academic and life success. But it\u2019s not just the job of educators\u2014family involvement plays a pivotal role in this stage of development. This article explores why family involvement matters in early childhood education and how it can be fostered effectively. Understanding Family Involvement Family involvement in early childhood education goes beyond parents attending parent-teacher meetings or school events. It\u2019s a broad concept that encompasses various activities where families engage actively in their child\u2019s learning process. This can range from reading stories at bedtime, and helping with homework, to co-creating learning activities with teachers. Benefits of Family Involvement in Early Childhood Education When families are involved in their child\u2019s early education, the results can be profound: Ways to Increase Family Involvement Increasing family involvement requires a conscious, concerted effort from both schools and families. Here are some strategies that work: Challenges and Solutions While the benefits of family involvement are clear, several barriers can stand in the way\u2014busy schedules, language differences, or lack of understanding about how to support learning at home. Schools can help overcome these barriers by offering flexible meeting times, providing information in multiple languages, and running workshops on how to support learning at home. Takeaway Family involvement is a powerful tool in shaping a child\u2019s early educational journey. It brings unique strengths and perspectives, enriches the learning environment, and ultimately leads to better outcomes for children. Let\u2019s remember that it takes a village to educate a child, and families are an integral part of that village. Discover the difference",

Download Free Ebook Today\u2019s parents are more involved than they\u2019ve ever been with their children\u2019s development. Except, it seems, when it comes to preschool. Many parents drop their kids off in the morning while the teachers take over, and then pick them up at the end of the day without giving their learning much thought. To get the true benefits from early childhood education, parents need to consider how they can support what their children are learning throughout the day. The benefits of parent involvement Some of a child\u2019s most important cognitive development happens during their preschool years. By taking an active role in the early childhood education process, parents can help ensure that their child has all the support they need to develop to their full potential. Parent involvement helps extend teaching outside the classroom, creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school. It is essential for parents to support the learning that happens in preschool settings at home as well. Parents who are in tune with what is happening in their child\u2019s preschool classroom or child care facility are better able to establish a connection between what is learned at school and what takes place in the home. This connection is a key component of a child\u2019s development and supporting further learning. Not only does family or parental involvement help extend teaching outside the classroom; it creates a more positive experience for children and helps children perform better when they are in school.

Yet efforts to engage parents have waned in recent years when policy and research support have focused on promoting children\u2019s school readiness skills with few resources devoted to family support services. This chapter illustrates the central role that parental involvement and engagement plays in promoting the lasting benefits of high-quality early education. We describe the Child-Parent Center (CPC) program and its emphasis on facilitating productive family engagement across the early childhood years (ages 3\u20139). In addition to prescribing specific strategies designed to involve parents in their children\u2019s education as well as for their own personal and career development, CPC creates school infrastructure supports (e.g., small class, resource centers) to sustain family engagement and align home-based and school-based learning. We describe the positive impact of the CPC program on parent involvement in their child\u2019s school, parent support for their child\u2019s learning at home, and parent expectations for child academic success.

Using admissions lotteries, the research found that participation in the preschool program led to significant long-term improvements in academic and behavioral outcomes in children. From the study authors: This work studies the impact of Boston Public Schools\u2019 (BPS) public preschool program using data on more than 4,000 preschool applicants from 1997 to 2003. The study leverages the randomization embedded in the BPS preschool lottery-based assignment process to compare the outcomes of students who won a preschool seat to students whose random lottery number was not high enough to win a seat. Notably, compared to students who did not attend the Boston Public Schools preschool program, attendees in this study were more likely to graduate high school, more likely to take the SAT, more likely to enroll in college on-time, and more likely to ever enroll in college. Additionally, students who attended preschool had fewer school suspensions in high school and were less likely to experience juvenile incarceration. Read the full study here and the brief here. According to the researchers: \u201cAs policymakers consider increased public investment in universal preschool, the research findings suggest that preschool can lead to long-term educational attainment gains through improvements in behavior. Furthermore, the observed effects across demographic groups suggest that all students are likely to benefit from universal preschool.\u201d The findings of this study add to the ever-growing arsenal of research and data that show the undeniable short- and long-term benefits of high-quality early childhood education.

Mar. 15, 2024 \u2022 By Studies Weekly Universal pre-K is a state policy framework to provide every child with a quality, publicly funded preschool education. The National Institute for Early Education Research (NIEER) reports that many states still do not have a universal pre-K policy, and some do not have any state-funded preschool at all, but those numbers are quickly changing as the universal pre-K movement catches on across the nation. What makes a Universal Pre-K Program universal? Many states have limited state-sponsored pre-K programs, but the programs must offer eligibility to every four-year-old in the state to be \u201cuniversal.\u201d NIEER also does not consider a program universal unless its enrollment reaches 70% of all four-year-olds in the state. At the time of the most recent State of Preschool report in 2022, only 11 states had implemented universal pre-K policies, and only 32% of four-year-olds and 6% of three-year-olds participated in a state-funded pre-K program at all.

Could public preschool benefit your children? The school districts in Georgia and New York do, and they subsequently have created a universal preschool curriculum for four-year-old students. While many parents, teachers, and communities debate the benefits of a public-wide preschool, many states are considering mandated and/or government-supported programs for young children and families. Why the Public Preschool is Gaining Attention Political Base states: \u201cState-funded public preschool is usually a means-tested program that provides early education to 3 and 4-year-olds. The goal in providing subsidized public preschool for low-income families is to provide a stable environment for young children during a crucial age of development.\u201d Essentially, since lower-income families cannot always provide sufficient child care, \u201ctheir children would be left at home. For many, this means unstable environments and T.V.s instead of teachers. It may also force single parents to stay home to raise children instead of work.\u201d As a result of these struggles, many states are implementing government-funded schools and educational programs to provide lower-income families with added assistance. Building on this framework, the state-mandated preschool programs are also ideally intended to provide families of all financial backgrounds with more supportive educational options for c",

High-quality preschool programs promise to close the 30 million words gap between low- and high-income students, and help develop the socio-emotional needs (in particular, executive function) of low-income students. Furthermore, universal access to early childhood education presents the possibility of a wide range of long-term academic and social benefits to students. Several small-scale studies show that at-risk children who receive a high-quality early childhood education are less likely to drop out of school, repeat grades, become a teen parent, or be arrested for a violent crime. They are also more likely to go on to college, earn higher salaries, and score higher on cognitive assessments. The benefits to the most vulnerable and underserved students suggest that society could save $7 for every $1 invested in early childhood education. In light of these findings, preschool for all has become a safe, bipartisan issue that focuses on cost-effective early intervention, leading to long-term societal benefits. Such political momentum behind universal pre-K has led to expansion of pre-K programs all across the country\u2014from 3-K for All in New York City to the universal pre-K program in Oklahoma. All of these programs differ slightly from one another, but a central tenet in many of these programs is increasing government provision of pre-K in public schools as part of an effort to improve the quality and availability of pre-K for all families. However, a pre-K expansion program that is dependent on a single-delivery model, focusing primarily on government provision of pre-K in public schools, creat",

Understanding the landscape of funding options, including state-specific grants and innovative approaches like crowdfunding, can empower preschool leaders to elevate their programs. This article delves into the essential strategies for identifying and securing funding, ensuring that every preschool has the chance to thrive and provide quality education to young learners. Exploring Funding Opportunities for Preschools Preschools have a wealth of financial opportunities at their disposal, including grants for preschools, private scholarships, and foundation support, which are crucial for enhancing educational services and resources. Key sources of funding include: According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, these initiatives are vital in increasing access to quality early childhood education. In fact, CCDF expenditures for GY 2020 highlight the significant investment in early childhood initiatives, emphasizing the role of federal support in expanding access. Many states, including Rhode Island, provide targeted grants for preschools that specifically support early childhood education. It\u2019s beneficial to explore your state\u2019s department of education website for detailed information on available programs. Notably, states with projected declines of 7.7 percent or more in K-12 enrollment could potentially reallocate resources to enhance early childhood education, creating new funding opportunities. Local Foundations: Numerous local organizations and foundations are dedicated to supporting educational initiatives within their communities.

The preschool industry is growing rapidly, with an expected revenue of .2 billion by 2025. However, funding and raising capital can be a daunting task. In this comprehensive guide, we\u2019ll explore the different options for preschool business financing and raising capital. Understand your financing needs Traditional financing Alternative financing Sponsorships and grants Let\u2019s dive in and find the best financing solution for your preschool business! Importance of having a solid business plan In preschool business financing and raising capital, having a solid business plan is the first and foremost requirement. Your business plan serves as the blueprint for your preschool and sets the foundation for its success. Not having a business plan is like venturing into uncharted territory without a map. A business plan serves as a guide that outlines your preschool\u2019s goals, values, strategies, and financial projections. One of the options for preschool financing is to obtain commercial childcare loans. A lender will always ask for a business plan before granting a loan. Without a business plan, getting a loan can be a daunting task. A business plan gives the lender insight into your preschool\u2019s operations, potential risks, and how you plan to use the loaned funds. Government funding for early childhood education often requires a business plan. Small business grants for preschools are also available, but again, ",

Urges States to Use Existing Funds to Expand Preschool Unable to offer new money, the Biden administration is hoping states and school districts can serve more children in preschool programs by using a patchwork of different federal funds that are already available. The Education Department and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Feb. 26 released guidelines detailing the range of existing funding streams states and school districts can use for early childhood programming\u2014including district-run prekindergarten, Head Start, and child care\u2014and how the different funding sources can fit together. The accompanying call to serve more children in early learning programs comes as preschool enrollment has yet to return to pre-pandemic levels and new federal funding for such programs is either drying up or has never come to fruition. At the same time, a number of states are implementing major preschool expansions or proposing them, and could couple federal funding sources with new state money. In a letter to state officials, the the two agencies highlighted a \u201cmixed delivery\u201d approach that combines different funding streams to serve more kids. The Education Department detailed in a new 28-page document how districts can use Title I to fund preschool programs that serve either all or a portion of local 3- and 4-year-olds. \u201cFederal funds, when effectively layered and braided, can support greater access to preschool, provide full-day, full-year high-quality services to meet families\u2019 needs, provide adequate wages and benefits to staff, and improve quality across programs,\u201d the agencies wrote in the letter. New early childhood funds are either drying up or haven\u2019t materialized The renewed attention to expanding early childhood enrollment follows a number of developments that have limited the funding available to grow, and sustain, early childhood programs\u2014and could challenge some in the coming years to continue serving the same number of children.

But it can be a costly ambition.\u00a0 After accounting for all these costs, there are often limited funds remaining to invest in new early learning program resources and tools. This is where grants are best used. Often, school and program directors look to apply for these funds so they can improve early learning experience for their young students.\u00a0 The United Nations declares that education is a basic human right in its Universal Declaration of Human Rights. With the increasing demand for early childhood education, there is pressure to create high-quality programs that are also affordable. In fact, the UN states in the same declaration that \u201cEducation shall be free, at least in the elementary and fundamental stages.\u201d Meeting demand and ensuring that every child gets a quality education is challenging enough, but with the pressure of making it affordable, and even free, the need for government funding is truly palpable.\u00a0 In the planning stages, it helps to know what funding options are available to develop and implement high-quality preschool programs that are inclusive and accessible. This article focuses on the US. We will cover the same topic, but for Canada in a future follow-up article. Early Learning Funding Is Complex Funding is a complex subject, and it\u2019s easy to get lost in the weeds about who the funding is meant to support.

All of today\u2019s pressing education policy issues relate directly to fulfilling educators\u2019 mission to provide students with the most effective teaching possible. As the pandemic rages, that mission becomes more important than ever. Educators\u2019 short-term focus is on establishing distance learning procedures that serve all students. However, the long-term impact of the pandemic remains unclear. Issues related to school funding, teacher training and retention, workforce development, and providing safe and welcoming education environments are too important to be shunted aside as the world focuses on combating the coronavirus. The times of greatest challenge can also be the times of greatest opportunity for effecting lasting, positive change. Educators and education leaders must face this catastrophe head-on and prepare to reimagine how communities can best serve the education needs of their children. #1: Education\u2019s Response to the Coronavirus The initial response to the shift from classroom instruction to distance learning has highlighted the disparity in online access that threatens to widen the digital divide between rich and poor students. The Associated Press reports that 17 percent of US students do not have access to computers at home, and 18 percent do not have broadband internet access from their homes. The problem extends beyond ensuring students have the necessary computers and internet access. Even when students have access to online learning resources via internet-connected devices, family circumstances may hinder their ability to complete coursework remotely.

The learning crisis was made worse by COVID-19 school closures Low quality instruction is a major constraint and prior to COVID-19, the learning poverty rate in low- and middle-income countries was 57% (6 out of 10 children could not read and understand basic texts by age 10). More dramatic is the case of Sub-Saharan Africa with a rate even higher at 86%. Several analyses show that the impact of the pandemic on student learning was significant, leaving students in low- and middle-income countries way behind in mathematics, reading and other subjects.\u00a0 Some argue that learning poverty may be close to 70% after the pandemic, with a substantial long-term negative effect in future earnings. This generation could lose around $21 trillion in future salaries, with the vulnerable students affected the most. 2. Countries are not paying enough attention to early childhood care and education (ECCE) At the pre-school level about two-thirds of countries do not have a proper legal framework to provide free and compulsory pre-primary education. According to UNESCO, only a minority of countries, mostly high-income, were making timely progress towards SDG4 benchmarks on early childhood indicators prior to the onset of COVID-19.

We review 26 studies using natural experiments to estimate the effects of universal preschool programs for children aged 0\u20136 years on child outcomes measured from third grade to adulthood. Studies comparing universal preschool with a mix of parental, family, and private modes of care show mixed effects on test scores and on measures related to health, well\u2010being, and behavior. All estimates for outcomes related to adequate primary and secondary school progression, years of schooling, highest degree completed, employment, and earnings indicate beneficial average effects of universal preschool programs. Three of the included studies calculate benefits\u2010to\u2010costs ratios and find ratios clearly above one.

This represents a significant departure from previous practices, where state taxes were primarily allocated to public education, indicating a shift towards a market-based approach in K-12 education. This shift is primarily motivated by two key factors: parental choice and the belief that competition will serve as the driver for overall improvement in our education system.

Wolf and Dr. Anna J. Egalite. The new report clearly shows that traditional public education by ZIP Code is being rapidly replaced by a variety of choice programs that empower families to find the best educational option for students. \u201cPursuing Innovation gives us a comprehensive look at the current state of innovation in K-12 education through the lens of competition, and the results are clear: Traditional public schools to which students are assigned by address are on the way out,\u201d said Friedman Foundation President and CEO Robert C. Enlow. \u201cWe know that school choice has led to increased innovation and tangible benefits for students, but we need to move from pockets of innovation to widespread choice if we want to see transformational improvement for all our schools,\u201d Enlow said. The report examines the types of competition that currently exist in K\u201312 education and what forms of competition are most likely to generate pressure for educational improvement based on the results of more than 40 studies on the topic. Pursuing Innovation concludes with policy design recommendations for lawmakers and stakeholders who want to increase innovation within K\u201312 education. Report authors Wolf and Egalite said the report shows that a small amount of competition in education already exists, but family resources and opportunity have played an outsized role in determining which types of students stand to benefit from the positive effects of competition. \u201cBecause",

Read the report as a PDF. The Kentucky General Assembly enacted a private school voucher program in 2021 and legislation was filed to expand the program before the state Supreme Court struck it down for violating Kentucky\u2019s constitution. That decision led directly to the legislature putting Amendment 2 on the ballot. Similar states that lack Kentucky\u2019s constitutional protections for public education have recently increased spending on vouchers and school privatization at a rapidly growing cost to their budgets. Given that history and context, it is plausible to assume the legislature will pursue a similar path if voters approve the amendment. This report estimates the impact, including by school district, if Amendment 2 is approved and the General Assembly enacts legislation to subsidize private schools using public funds. It models the impact of voucher legislation similar to recent expansions in several states. For Kentucky, establishing a program proportional to what Florida, the largest state program, has in place would cost $1.19 billion annually from the Kentucky state budget. That equals the cost of employing 9,869 Kentucky public school teachers and employees.\u00a0\u00a0 Even a much smaller initial voucher program just one-sixth the proportional size of Florida\u2019s and smaller than the rapidly growing programs in Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, North Carolina, Ohio and Wisconsin would cost Kentucky\u2019s budget $199 million",

For this reason, efforts to engage families in meaningful collaboration is a long-standing goal of high-quality early childhood education (ECE). Family\u2013school engagement can take multiple forms; in this review, we focus on universal preschool-based outreach strategies that help parents support growth in child social-emotional and self-regulation competencies and prepare them for the transition into formal schooling. Recent research has expanded understanding of the neurodevelopmental processes that underlie child school readiness, and the impact of parenting (and the social ecology affecting parenting) on those processes. These new insights have fueled innovation in preschool-based efforts to partner with and support parents, expanding and shifting the focus of that programming. In addition, new approaches to intervention design and delivery are emerging to address the pervasive challenges of reaching and engaging families, especially those representing diverse racial, ethnic, cultural, a",

Using data from the Head Start Impact Study (n = 3503; 50% male, 63% treatment group), the present study extends this work to consider program impact variation based on centers\u2019 location in urban versus rural communities. Results indicate that Head Start is more effective in increasing children\u2019s receptive vocabulary (as measured by the PPVT) in urban areas and their oral comprehension (as measured by the Woodcock-Johnson Oral Comprehension task) in rural areas. Additional analyses suggest that related characteristics of the center \u2013 including concentration of dual language learners and provision of transportation services \u2013 may underlie these associations. Implications for research on program evaluation and policy are discussed. Keywords: Head Start, preschool, impact variation, language and literacy, urbanicity, neighborhoods Since the 1960\u2019s, increased understanding of the importance of the early childhood developmental period has led to substantial investment in early childhood care and education (ECCE) programs like Head Start for promoting school readiness and reducing income",

Bitler, UC Davis; Hilary Hoynes, UC Berkeley; and Thurston Domina, UNC Preschool interventions are arguably one of the most important elements of support for poor families. Head Start, a federal program for children in low-income families administered through the Department of Health and Human Services, is a case in point. While research shows a range of benefits lasting beyond preschool for participants, evidence of the \u201cfade-out\u201d of cognitive gains of the preschool years and the differential impact of the program on children with different skill levels in the preschool population has prompted debate over its efficacy. Our recent work is the first comprehensive analysis of how modern Head Start impacts vary across the skill distribution in the preschool and early elementary period. We find evidence of a large and positive short-term effect of Head Start, and that cognitive gains are largest at the bottom of the achievement spectrum, particularly among Hispanic children.1\u00a0The results of our study and others showing a positive effect in other areas add to the evidence of the success of Head Start in improving the wellbeing of poor children. Key Facts Head Start is the primary federal preschool program for low-income children in the U.S. In 2016 Head Start and Early Head Start served over 900,000 children with a budget of nearly $9 billion.2\u00a0The program aims to narrow inequalities in educational outcomes and raise educational attainment levels by providing matching funds to community programs that provide preschool, healthcare and nutritional services to children in poor families (local partners must provide 25 percent of the federal funding, which equals 20 percent of the total budget.3) Since Head Start\u2019s establishment in 1965, decades of research has documented its impact, however, there is debate over how and for wh",

These advantages appear immediately, last a lifetime, and even have an effect on other generations. The effects are particularly strong amongst certain subgroups of children, particularly Hispanic and African-American children, dual language learners, children who are homeless or in foster care, those who qualify for free lunch, and those whose mothers didn't graduate high school.

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nIn this debate, we shall argue that we should subsidize preschool, defined as government funding provided to reduce the cost of early childhood education programs for children aged 3-5, focusing on their cognitive, social, and emotional development.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. The optimal policy yields the greatest overall benefit to society, considering both short-term and long-term impacts on children, families, and the economy. This framework is appropriate because it encompasses the wide-ranging effects of preschool subsidies.\n\nFirst, preschool subsidies improve long-term educational outcomes and reduce societal inequalities. Research indicates that access to high-quality preschool, especially for children from low-income families, leads to improved school readiness [8].  The positive effects of universal, high-quality preschool persist through tenth grade, demonstrating sustained benefits [8]. Studies show that preschool programs improve children's cognitive and social-emotional development, leading to better academic performance throughout their schooling [8]. This, in turn, results in higher rates of high school graduation and college enrollment [9], ultimately creating a more educated and productive workforce, thus benefiting society.\n\nSecond, preschool subsidies provide substantial economic benefits. By enabling parents, especially mothers, to enter or remain in the workforce, subsidies boost family incomes and increase overall economic productivity [4].  One study found that expanding child care subsidies could boost a local economy significantly [4]. Affordable access to child care is crucial for supporting children's healthy development, enabling parents to work or attend school, and helping businesses and the overall economy thrive [4]. Moreover, the increased tax revenue from employed parents and the reduced need for future social services due to improved educational outcomes offset the cost of the subsidies, making them a fiscally responsible investment [1]. Research indicates that high-quality public preschool programs for disadvantaged children yield benefits that outweigh the costs [1].\n\nThird, preschool subsidies strengthen families and communities. Access to affordable, high-quality preschool reduces parental stress and improves family well-being [2, 8]. Stable use of subsidies supports continuity of care, positively impacting children's development and meeting families' needs [2]. Moreover, preschool fosters social and emotional development in children, preparing them to become engaged and responsible citizens [5]. These positive effects ripple through communities, potentially leading to stronger social cohesion and a reduction in crime rates in the long run.  Subsidies help bridge the opportunity gap for children from low-income families, contributing to a more equitable society [1].\n\n\nIn conclusion, subsidizing preschool is a worthwhile investment that generates significant positive returns for children, families, and society as a whole, ultimately leading to a more prosperous and equitable future.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) National Association of State Boards of Education (NASBE).

These interventions often offer higher returns on investment compared to universal programs by focusing resources on those most in need. Subsidizing universal preschool risks diverting funds from these more effective, targeted approaches, ultimately hindering overall educational progress.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Government-subsidized preschool creates an artificial demand, leading to inflated tuition costs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_4', 'query': 'The impact of government subsidies on preschool tuition costs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '2_25', 'query': 'The economics of government-funded preschool and its effect on private preschools', 'title': 'More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ...', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy'}]\n**Long Argument**: A key study from the Heritage Foundation (2_25) directly addresses the unintended consequence of government-subsidized preschool: the artificial inflation of tuition.  The study explains how government-funded preschools undercut private providers, creating a demand driven by subsidies rather than actual market needs.  This allows private institutions to elevate tuition costs, as they are no longer solely competing on price and quality within a free market. The subsidized \"free\" option distorts the market, giving private preschools leeway to inflate prices. Moreover, the PWBM study (2_4) reveals how government intervention in education, through subsidies and funding, can lead to significant increases in costs, mirroring the trend we're discussing in preschool. The study concludes that increased costs associated with such programs are often financed through debt, further burdening taxpayers. The combined effect of artificially inflated demand and increased costs demonstrates how subsidies ultimately lead to higher tuition, impacting both families and the economy as a whole. While some might argue subsidies increase access, they fail to address underlying affordability issues and instead create market distortions. This supports the conclusion that government-subsidized preschool ultimately inflates tuition costs due to artificial demand.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Subsidizing preschool creates a larger government bureaucracy, increasing administrative costs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '7_8', 'query': 'Cost of administering government preschool programs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '7_12', 'query': 'Bureaucratic overhead of public preschool programs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '7_35', 'query': 'Administrative costs of public preschool as a percentage of total costs', 'title': 'What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates', 'url': 'https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool'}, {'id': '7_40', 'query': 'Administrative burden of CCDF program on preschool providers', 'title': 'Improving Child Care Access, Affordability, and Stability in the Child ...', 'url': 'https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/01/2024-04139/improving-child-care-access-affordability-and-stability-in-the-child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf'}, {'id': '7_43', 'query': 'Administrative burden of CCDF program on preschool providers', 'title': 'Keeping kids in care: Reducing administrative burden in state Child ...', 'url': 'https://researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/148536'}]\n**Long Argument**: Studies show that the administrative burden of public preschool programs is substantial and grows with program expansion.  Research on the CCDF program (\"7_40\",\"7_43\") demonstrates the existing challenges related to eligibility verification, payment processing, and compliance monitoring.  Scaling this program to accommodate universal preschool would dramatically increase the need for administrative staff, resources, and complex systems to handle the influx of applications and ensure proper allocation of funds.  This expansion would inflate administrative costs, diverting resources away from educational services and potentially negating the intended benefits of the program.  The Penn Wharton Budget Model study (\"7_8\", \"7_12\") projects an increase in government debt from such programs, with a portion attributable to higher administrative spending.  Furthermore, as administrative expenses often consume 15% to 20% of total operating costs (\"7_35\"), the potential for significant financial strain on the system is evident.  While proponents might argue for long-term economic benefits, the immediate increase in bureaucratic overhead presents a considerable fiscal challenge.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 396 words for the opening statement.

        "content": "**My opening statement**\n\nFriends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that we should subsidize preschool.  Our opponents have presented a vision of universal preschool as a panacea for societal ills, but we believe this vision is clouded by well-intentioned but ultimately misguided policy.  We contend that universal preschool subsidies are not only inefficient but also counterproductive, leading to unintended consequences that harm the very families and children they intend to help.\n\nOur judging criteria for this debate is maximizing the effectiveness of educational spending.  We believe that every dollar invested in education should yield the greatest possible return in terms of improved outcomes for children.  This framework is crucial because it prioritizes demonstrable results and responsible stewardship of public funds.\n\nFirst, let's address the misallocation of resources. While universal preschool sounds appealing, it spreads limited resources thinly across all families, regardless of need. Studies on targeted interventions for disadvantaged children, such as the Chicago Child-Parent Centers [1, 2], demonstrate significantly higher returns on investment.  These programs focus resources on those who benefit most, leading to substantial improvements in educational outcomes. By diverting funds towards universal preschool, we risk shortchanging these proven, targeted interventions and hindering overall educational progress.  We must prioritize effectiveness, not just broad access.\n\nNow, consider the impact on tuition costs.  Our opponents argue that subsidies make preschool more affordable.  However, a key study from the Heritage Foundation [3] shows that government-funded preschool creates an artificial demand, allowing private institutions to inflate tuition.  This is because government-funded preschools undercut private providers, creating a demand driven by subsidies, not actual market needs. This gives private preschools the opportunity to raise prices, as they are no longer solely competing on price and quality. As highlighted in the Penn Wharton Budget Model study [4], government intervention through subsidies and funding can lead to cost increases. This model shows increased costs linked to such programs are often financed through debt, burdening taxpayers. The combined effect of artificial demand and increased costs demonstrates how subsidies lead to higher tuition, impacting families and the broader economy. Subsidies may appear to increase access but fail to address underlying affordability issues and instead distort the market. This underscores how government-subsidized preschool inflates tuition due to artificial demand.\n\nFinally, let's examine the administrative burden. Expanding preschool programs necessitates a larger government bureaucracy to manage the influx of applications, allocate funds, and ensure compliance.  Research on the Child Care and Development Fund program [5, 6] reveals the existing administrative challenges. Scaling this program for universal preschool would exacerbate these challenges, requiring more staff, resources, and complex systems. This would divert resources away from educational services and negate the program's intended benefits. The Penn Wharton Budget Model study [4] projects increased government debt from such programs, partly due to higher administrative spending.  Considering that administrative expenses often consume 15% to 20% of total operating costs [7], the potential for significant financial strain is evident. While proponents tout long-term economic benefits, the immediate increase in bureaucratic overhead poses a considerable fiscal challenge.  We believe in responsible spending and maximizing the impact of each educational dollar.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Early Childhood Interventions: Benefits, Costs, and Savings. https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_briefs/RB5014.html\n\n[2] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n\n[3] More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ... https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy\n\n[4] Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/\n\n[5] Improving Child Care Access, Affordability, and Stability in the Child ... https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/03/01/2024-04139/improving-child-care-access-affordability-and-stability-in-the-child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf\n\n[6] Keeping kids in care: Reducing administrative burden in state Child ... https://researchconnections.org/childcare/resources/148536\n\n[7] What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates. https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool\n"

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, specifically regarding resource allocation, tuition costs, and administrative burden. They operate under a narrow framework of maximizing educational spending effectiveness, neglecting the broader societal benefits we champion: maximizing societal benefit. A policy\u2019s true value lies in its holistic impact on society, considering not only educational outcomes but also factors like reduced healthcare costs due to preventative care and improved long-term health outcomes [1], increased social mobility through better access to opportunities [2], and stronger community bonds through shared early childhood experiences.\n\nFirst, the negative side argues that \u201cuniversal preschool spreads limited resources thinly across all families, regardless of need.\u201d However, this argument presents a false dichotomy. Universal preschool and targeted programs are not mutually exclusive. Funding can, and should, be allocated to both, creating a synergistic approach that maximizes benefits. Research by Barnett and Haskins [3] supports the effectiveness of combining universal access with targeted support for children with greater needs. This dual approach yields greater overall positive impacts than either method individually. Moreover, universal preschool offers long-term societal benefits, such as increased workforce participation [4], which targeted interventions alone may not achieve. We must consider the broader picture of societal gain, not just immediate educational spending.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that \u201cgovernment-funded preschool creates an artificial demand, allowing private institutions to inflate tuition.\u201d  However, this argument misrepresents the complex dynamics of the preschool market.  Tuition increases are influenced by multiple factors like inflation and rising operational costs for all providers, not solely by subsidies.  Furthermore, subsidies significantly increase affordability for low-income families, enabling them to access quality preschool, an opportunity they might otherwise miss [5]. While managing potential cost increases is a valid concern, the claim that subsidies *solely* drive tuition inflation overlooks crucial factors and their importance in expanding access. Subsidies can even incentivize the creation of more affordable preschool options by stimulating competition.  By providing funding, the government effectively lowers the barrier to entry for new providers, particularly those focused on serving lower-income families.  This increased competition can pressure existing providers to moderate their price increases and offer more competitive rates, ultimately benefiting families.\n\nThird, the negative team asserts that universal preschool would create an insurmountable administrative burden, arguing that \u201cScaling this program for universal preschool would exacerbate these challenges, requiring more staff, resources, and complex systems.\u201d This argument assumes an inefficient expansion of the bureaucracy, which isn\u2019t necessarily the case. A well-planned expansion, leveraging existing infrastructure and streamlining processes, can minimize administrative burden.  For instance, successful programs like Head Start [7] demonstrate how effective management and targeted allocation of resources can mitigate administrative challenges in large-scale early childhood programs. While acknowledging administrative costs, we argue that these are dwarfed by the long-term economic benefits of a more educated workforce and reduced social service costs [6]\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heckman, J.

You should stand firm on your position (OPPOSE the motion) and attack the opponent's weak points.\nYour position is to OPPOSE the motion. The opponent is to SUPPORT the motion.\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Structure of a Rebuttal\nA complete rebuttal should consist of multiple points, with each point containing four parts:\n- **Lead-in:** Introduce the opponent's argument, evidence, reasoning, etc., that you will be refuting.\n- **Explanation:** Briefly explain the opponent's argument to ensure clarity.\n- **Rebuttal:** This is the core of your point. Utilize rebuttal techniques to directly challenge the opponent's claim.\n- **Impact:** Concisely summarize the impact of your rebuttal and how it benefits your side.\n\nNote: Typically, the lead-in and explanation are combined into one sentence. The rebuttal is the most crucial part, and the impact summarizes its effect.\n\n### Rebuttal Techniques\n- **Pointing out logical fallacies:** Identify errors in the opponent's reasoning, such as reversing cause and effect, equivocation (shifting the meaning of a key term), straw man arguments, circular reasoning, or tautology (repeating the same idea in different words).\n- **Pointing out factual errors:** Highlight inaccuracies or weaknesses in the opponent's evidence, such as insufficient data, incorrect facts, or biased sources.\n- **Leveling the playing field:** This technique aims to neutralize the opponent's advantage or minimize the perceived harm of your side's position by demonstrating that both sides share the same issue or benefit.\n    - **Example 1:** \"You claim A, but B also has this problem. Therefore, both sides are equal in this regard, both having the issue.\"\n    - **Example 2:** \"You mention the benefits of A, but B also offers the same benefits. So, both sides are equal in this aspect, both being advantageous.\"\n\n## Rules \n- Ensure your rebuttal speech flows naturally, resembling human language. Avoid mechanically or formulaically applying the 'cite-interpret-refute-conclude' structure; instead, integrate it seamlessly into your writing.\n- When citing data or academic research to support your rebuttals, provide clear sources. Do not reference materials that are not present in the given context.\n\n## Workflow \n1. Structure your response according to the Plan, connecting the given Arguments with minimal transitions to maintain flow. Do not add new evidence.\n2. Transform arguments into conversational yet professional language suitable for public speaking. Write as you would speak, with varied sentence lengths. Use everyday language while keeping the original argument sequence. \n3. Use clear verbal signposting. Use clear transitions: 'Let me turn to ', 'This brings me to'. Include listener-oriented phrases: 'As you'll see ', 'Consider this '. Signal key points: 'The crucial issue here is ', 'What's particularly important '. \n4. You SHOULD connect with your audience by:\n- Reframe some scenarios of the evidence to directly involve the audience by using 'you' as the protagonist and describing how the situation would impact their lives, making abstract concepts personally relevant and emotionally resonant.5. Maintain proportional argument lengths as specified in the plan (short < medium < long).\n6. Renumber the original citations and use the following citation format:\n- In text: Use [1], [2], etc., with journal names when available\n- Include phrases like 'Studies show' or 'Research indicates'\n- List full references in **Reference** section. This section should start with **Reference**. \n7. Deliver a 447-word rebuttal statement. After the rebuttal statement, include a separate **Reference** section which does not count toward the 447 word limit. The response should be written in clear, flowing transcript for the competitive debate game of prose without any bullet points, asterisks, or numbered lists.  Present only the final text.\n\n## Rebuttal Plans: \n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: Universal preschool, combined with targeted interventions, maximizes societal benefit.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_7', 'query': 'Benefits of targeted educational interventions for disadvantaged children', 'title': 'PDF', 'url': 'https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf'}, {'id': '9_7', 'query': 'Disadvantages of universal preschool', 'title': 'Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good'}, {'id': '4_0', 'query': 'Effects of universal preschool on private preschools', 'title': 'The Controversy of Universal Preschool and How It Affects Childcare ...', 'url': 'https://www.daycarestudio.net/home/the-controversy-of-universal-preschool-and-how-it-affects-childcare-providers'}, {'id': '4_2', 'query': 'Effects of universal preschool on private preschools', 'title': \"Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses ... - KQED\", 'url': 'https://www.kqed.org/news/11893791/why-californias-universal-transitional-kindergarten-plan-poses-a-threat-to-some-early-childhood-ed-providers'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Targeted interventions, as evidenced by research like the RAND study (\"0_7\"), demonstrate clear benefits for disadvantaged children. However, universal pre-K's impact is less conclusive. Some studies suggest that academic gains from universal programs fade out over time, negating long-term societal benefits (\"9_7\").  Furthermore, the financial strain on private preschools from free public options (\"4_0\", \"4_2\") could lead to a decline in quality and availability of preschool options for those who do not choose public options. This unintended consequence diminishes the overall societal benefit claimed from universal preschool.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: Government-funded preschool does not solely cause private preschool tuition inflation.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_0', 'query': 'The impact of government subsidies on preschool tuition costs', 'title': 'Economic Effects of Expanding Subsidized Child Care and Providing ...', 'url': 'https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57630'}]\n**Short Argument**: Government subsidies, while increasing access for some, do not negate their inflationary impact on private preschool tuition.  Evidence shows increased government spending on preschool coincides with rising tuition costs. (\"2_0\") This suggests subsidies inflate demand, allowing private providers to raise prices, ultimately harming middle-class families who don't qualify for subsidies but struggle with increased market rates.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: A well-planned expansion of universal preschool can minimize administrative burden.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '7_26', 'query': 'Growth of government agencies due to preschool funding', 'title': 'Executive Summary - National Institute for Early Education Research', 'url': 'https://nieer.org/yearbook/2023/executive-summary'}, {'id': '7_27', 'query': 'Growth of government agencies due to preschool funding', 'title': 'Resources to Support Preschool Expansion and Early School Success', 'url': 'https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/resources-support-preschool-expansion-and-early-school-success'}, {'id': '7_35', 'query': 'Administrative costs of public preschool as a percentage of total costs', 'title': 'What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates', 'url': 'https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The assertion that universal preschool expansion minimizes administrative burden is misleading. While streamlining may be intended, the inherent growth in program scale necessitates more, not less, administration.  Evidence shows administrative costs account for 15-20% of total preschool expenses (\"7_35\"), a cost amplified by expansion.  States adding substantial preschool funding illustrate this trend, where increased funding directly correlates with increased enrollment and administrative needs (\"7_26\"). The sheer volume of children entering the system requires significant resources for enrollment, oversight, and compliance, thus increasing the overall administrative burden.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Universal preschool creates unnecessary competition for resources with more pressing educational needs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_10', 'query': 'Cost-benefit analysis of universal preschool programs', 'title': 'Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies', 'url': 'https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/'}, {'id': '6_20', 'query': 'Most pressing needs in education', 'title': '7 Education Policy Issues That Need to Be Solved in 2020', 'url': 'https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/education-policy-issues-in-2020/'}, {'id': '6_23', 'query': 'Most pressing needs in education', 'title': 'Four of the biggest problems facing education\u2014and four trends that ...', 'url': 'https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/four-biggest-problems-facing-education-and-four-trends-could-make-difference'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Implementing universal preschool necessitates significant financial investment, diverting funds from other crucial educational needs.  The Penn Wharton study (\"0_10\") highlighted the substantial costs and negative economic impact of such programs. This creates a direct competition for resources with more pressing issues like the persistent learning crisis, exacerbated by COVID-19 (\"6_23\"), or insufficient teacher pay (\"6_20\"). Targeted interventions for at-risk children or improving existing educational infrastructure offer better returns on investment compared to broad, costly universal programs.\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Subsidizing preschool for all reduces the incentive for private investment in early childhood education.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_25', 'query': 'The economics of government-funded preschool and its effect on private preschools', 'title': 'More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ...', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy'}]\n**Short Argument**: Government-funded preschool undercuts the private market by offering \"free\" (taxpayer-funded) alternatives, thus reducing the incentive for private investment. This \"crowd-out\" effect, where public provision displaces private investment, is documented in studies on the impact of universal preschool on childcare markets (2_25).\n\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Universal preschool can lead to unintended social consequences, such as increased pressure on parents.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_0', 'query': 'negative social consequences of universal preschool', 'title': 'Universal Preschool Programs Expand, Despite Documented Harms', 'url': 'https://fee.org/articles/universal-preschool-programs-expand-despite-documented-harms/'}, {'id': '8_3', 'query': 'negative social consequences of universal preschool', 'title': 'Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good', 'url': 'https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good'}, {'id': '8_5', 'query': 'pressure on parents universal preschool', 'title': \"Universal Preschool Cookie-Cutter Pressure: Head Start's Troubling ...\", 'url': 'https://nancyebailey.com/2021/11/13/universal-preschool-cookie-cutter-pressure-head-starts-troubling-framework/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Universal preschool, while seemingly beneficial, can create unintended pressures on parents. Studies reveal the negative impacts of public pre-K programs on children's academic and behavioral outcomes (\"8_0\", \"8_3\"). This, coupled with the pressure to conform to a standardized curriculum (\"8_5\"), can increase parental stress as they grapple with suboptimal learning experiences and pressure to supplement their child's education.\n\n\n\n\n## Tips: \n1. Revisit scenarios or examples from your opening statement to reinforce key points\n2. Use contrasts to highlight the strengths of your position.

        "content": "**My rebuttal statement**\n\nFriends, judges, and esteemed audience, our opponents paint a rosy picture of universal preschool, but their arguments fail to address the fundamental flaws we\u2019ve highlighted. They advocate for maximizing societal benefit, a broad and subjective measure, while we focus on maximizing the effectiveness of educational spending, a concrete and measurable goal.  This difference in approach is crucial to understanding the true impact of universal preschool.\n\nLet's revisit the issue of resource allocation. Our opponents suggest a synergistic approach, combining universal preschool with targeted interventions.  However, this ideal scenario overlooks the reality of limited resources. As the RAND study [1] demonstrates, targeted interventions for disadvantaged children yield significant benefits.  Conversely, the long-term benefits of universal pre-K are less clear, with some studies suggesting academic gains fade over time [2].  Furthermore, the pressure on private preschools from free public options [3, 4] could lead to a decline in quality, impacting families who choose non-public options. This undercuts the overall societal benefit they claim.\n\nNext, let's address tuition costs. Our opponents argue that multiple factors contribute to rising tuition, but they fail to acknowledge the inflationary pressure of government subsidies. Evidence shows increased government spending coincides with rising tuition [5]. Subsidies, while increasing access for some, create artificial demand, allowing private providers to raise prices.  This disproportionately harms middle-class families who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies but face increased market rates.  Think about it\u2014if you're a middle-class family, you\u2019re stuck paying higher prices without the benefit of subsidies.\n\nRegarding administrative burden, our opponents claim a well-planned expansion can minimize the burden.  This is simply wishful thinking.  Any expansion, regardless of planning, inherently increases administrative needs. Remember, administrative costs already consume 15-20% of preschool expenses [6]. This cost will inevitably grow with program expansion.  As states increase preschool funding, they experience increased enrollment and, consequently, greater administrative demands [7].  More children mean more resources required for enrollment, oversight, and compliance.  The notion that this burden can be minimized is unrealistic.\n\nMoreover, universal preschool creates competition for resources with other pressing educational needs.  The Penn Wharton study [8] highlighted the substantial costs and potentially negative economic impacts of universal programs.  These funds could be better used to address pressing issues like the learning crisis exacerbated by COVID-19 [9] or inadequate teacher pay [10].  Imagine if those funds went towards supporting struggling students or attracting better teachers\u2014the potential positive impact on education is undeniable.\n\nFurthermore, government-funded preschool discourages private investment in early childhood education. By offering \"free\" alternatives, it creates a \"crowd-out\" effect, displacing private investment [11]. This limits innovation and choice in the preschool market, ultimately harming the diversity and quality of early childhood education.\n\nFinally, consider the unintended social consequences.  Studies reveal negative impacts of public pre-K on academic and behavioral outcomes [12, 13].  The pressure to conform to standardized curriculums [14] increases parental stress.  Parents may feel forced to supplement their child's education due to suboptimal learning experiences, adding extra costs and time commitments.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n[2] Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good\n[3] The Controversy of Universal Preschool and How It Affects Childcare ... https://www.daycarestudio.net/home/the-controversy-of-universal-preschool-and-how-it-affects-childcare-providers\n[4] Why California's Universal Transitional Kindergarten Plan Poses ... - KQED. https://www.kqed.org/news/11893791/why-californias-universal-transitional-kindergarten-plan-poses-a-threat-to-some-early-childhood-ed-providers\n[5] Economic Effects of Expanding Subsidized Child Care and Providing ... https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57630\n[6] What Are the Top Expenses for Preschools? - Business Plan Templates. https://businessplan-templates.com/blogs/running-costs/preschool\n[7] Resources to Support Preschool Expansion and Early School Success. https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/resources-support-preschool-expansion-and-early-school-success\n[8] Weighing the Costs and Benefits of Preschool and Childcare Policies. https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/weighing-costs-benefits-preschool-childcare-policies/\n[9] Four of the biggest problems facing education\u2014and four trends that ... https://blogs.worldbank.org/en/education/four-biggest-problems-facing-education-and-four-trends-could-make-difference\n[10] 7 Education Policy Issues That Need to Be Solved in 2020. https://soeonline.american.edu/blog/education-policy-issues-in-2020/\n[11] More Government Preschool: An Expensive and Unnecessary Middle-Class ... https://www.heritage.org/education/report/more-government-preschool-expensive-and-unnecessary-middle-class-subsidy\n[12] Universal Preschool Programs Expand, Despite Documented Harms. https://fee.org/articles/universal-preschool-programs-expand-despite-documented-harms/\n[13] Research Review: Universal Preschool May Do More Harm than Good. https://www.heritage.org/education/report/research-review-universal-preschool-may-do-more-harm-good\n[14] Universal Preschool Cookie-Cutter Pressure: Head Start's Troubling ... https://nancyebailey.com/2021/11/13/universal-preschool-cookie-cutter-pressure-head-starts-troubling-framework/\n"

        "content": "**Opponent's closing Statement**\nThank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate hinges on whether subsidizing preschool truly maximizes societal benefit, our core judging criteria.  The negative team argues for targeted interventions, claiming universal pre-K is inefficient. We contend this is a false choice.  We can, and should, do both. Research shows combining universal access with targeted support maximizes positive impact [3].  Furthermore, universal pre-K offers unique long-term societal benefits, like increased social mobility [2] and a stronger workforce [9], advantages targeted programs alone cannot achieve.  Concerning their argument about declining private preschool quality, quality control measures like mandatory accreditation and regular inspections would ensure standards are maintained across all providers, public and private.\n\nOur opponents also claim subsidies artificially inflate tuition.  This ignores the reality that multiple factors, including rising operational costs and inflation, contribute to tuition increases. Subsidies, however, directly address affordability for low-income families [5], enabling access to quality preschool otherwise unattainable.  Furthermore, subsidies can stimulate competition.  To mitigate potential cost increases, we propose tying subsidy amounts to a sliding scale based on provider quality ratings and operating costs, incentivizing both affordability and high standards.  This market-based approach promotes value and efficiency.\n\nThe negative team's argument against government funding discouraging private investment is unfounded. Subsidies actually *stimulate* the market by increasing demand, attracting new providers and encouraging innovation\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heckman, J. J.

Our opponents, while well-intentioned, advocate for a costly universal program with questionable long-term benefits.  We\u2019ve demonstrated that targeted interventions for disadvantaged children offer greater returns on investment [1].  Universal pre-K risks diverting funds from these proven programs, potentially harming the very children it intends to help.  While they claim a synergistic approach, combining universal access with targeted support, this ignores the reality of limited resources.  Every dollar spent on universal pre-K is a dollar not spent on demonstrably effective programs.\n\nFurthermore, their argument for increased societal benefit through universal preschool fails to account for the unintended consequences.  We\u2019ve shown how subsidies can inflate tuition, impacting middle-class families who don\u2019t qualify for assistance but face increased market rates [5]. Imagine struggling to afford preschool because of inflated prices caused by the very subsidies intended to help others.  Their proposed solution, tying subsidies to quality ratings, adds another layer of bureaucracy and complexity, further straining resources.\n\nFinally, their dismissal of the administrative burden is unrealistic.  Expanding a program to include every child inherently increases administrative costs, regardless of planning. This diverts funds away from direct educational services.  We believe in maximizing the impact of every educational dollar, prioritizing effectiveness and fiscal responsibility. Therefore, we urge you to oppose this motion and support a more targeted, efficient approach to early childhood education.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] PDF. https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/1998/RB5014.pdf\n[5] Economic Effects of Expanding Subsidized Child Care and Providing ... https://www.cbo.gov/publication/57630\n\n\n"
