      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand firmly in support of the motion: Social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content.  We believe this is a crucial step towards a more transparent, accountable, and ultimately safer online environment. Let\u2019s first clarify what we mean by this motion.\n\nSocial media companies, the platforms enabling us to share and connect with others online, must clearly label all AI-generated content.  This includes any text, image, audio, or video created wholly or partially by AI, regardless of who posts it.  Think of it like the labels we already see for sponsored posts or political ads\u2014clear, readily visible, and consistent across platforms.  These labels will be enforced by regulatory bodies like the FTC, ensuring compliance through audits and penalties.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will labeling AI-generated content contribute to a more informed and responsible online environment? We believe the answer is a resounding yes. Consider this:  when you scroll through your feed, wouldn\u2019t you want to know if what you're seeing is a genuine human expression or the product of an algorithm?\n\nLet me turn to our first argument: Labeling fosters greater transparency and accountability.  Platforms like Facebook have already begun labeling some AI-generated content, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of this practice. As you'll see, when you know a piece of content is AI-generated, you can engage with it more critically, questioning its potential biases or inaccuracies. This transparency holds creators accountable and empowers you, the user, to make informed decisions about the information you consume. [1]\n\nThis brings me to our second, and arguably most crucial, argument: Labeling aligns with existing regulations and legal frameworks. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires clear labeling for consumer products to prevent deception.  This principle of transparency applies equally to the digital world.  AI-generated content, if unlabeled, can mislead you, the consumer, about its origins and nature. Just as you have a right to know what\u2019s in the food you buy, you deserve to know whether the content you're consuming is human-created or AI-generated. [2, 3, 4, 5]  The crucial issue here is not censorship, but informed consumption. It's about empowering you to navigate the digital landscape with the knowledge you need to make informed choices.  Moreover, the rise of deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content underscores the urgency of this issue. Without clear labeling, the potential for widespread misinformation is immense, threatening the very fabric of our shared reality.\n\nFinally, what's particularly important is that labeling helps policymakers understand the impact of AI-generated content on society.  By tracking the prevalence and influence of AI-generated content, policymakers can make data-driven decisions to mitigate potential harms. This allows for informed regulation and the development of strategies to address issues like misinformation and manipulation. The MIT Media Lab emphasizes the importance of such labeling for informed policymaking in the age of AI.  [6]\n\nIn conclusion, requiring social media companies to label AI-generated content is not just a good idea; it's a necessary step to safeguard the integrity of our online spaces.  It empowers you, the user, with crucial information, fosters accountability, and provides policymakers with the data they need to navigate the evolving digital landscape. We urge you to support this motion for a more transparent and responsible online future.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Facebook AI Label: Enhancing Transparency and Trust in Social Media Content.  https://aithenticate.org/artificial-intelligence/facebook-ai-label-enhancing-transparency-and-trust-in-social-media-content/\n[2] Fair Packaging and Labeling Act: Regulations Under Section ...  https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-packaging-labeling-act-regulations-under-section-4-fair-packaging-labeling-act\n[3] United States Product Labeling Requirements. https://www.compliancegate.com/united-states-product-labeling-requirements/\n[4] The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling ... https://fstoppers.com/artificial-intelligence/critical-necessity-immediate-regulation-and-labeling-ai-generated-media-688199\n[5] Synthetic Media & Deepfakes. https://innovating.news/article/synthetic-media-deepfakes/\n[6] Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions - MIT Media Lab. https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/labeling-ai-generated-content-promises-perils-and-future-directions/\n"

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue against the proposition that social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content.  We define AI-generated content as any content created primarily by artificial intelligence tools, encompassing text, images, audio, and video. Social media companies are defined as platforms facilitating the creation and sharing of information via virtual communities and networks. Labeling refers to a clear and easily identifiable mark or disclosure on a piece of content indicating its origin as AI-generated.\n\nOur judging criteria is minimizing harm and maximizing benefit. The optimal approach minimizes potential harms while maximizing the benefits of AI-generated content. This framework allows us to weigh both the potential negative consequences of unregulated AI content and the potential stifling of innovation from overly restrictive policies. We contend that mandatory labeling does more harm than good.\n\nFirst, mandatory labeling is ineffective and potentially counterproductive.  While proponents argue labeling increases transparency, research from the MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab [1] suggests that simply labeling content as AI-generated doesn't address the core issue of verifying its truthfulness or harmfulness. This can lead to a \"liar's dividend,\" where widespread skepticism towards all content undermines trust in authentic sources [1].  A study by YouGov [10] found that 48% of respondents would distrust content labeled as AI-generated, highlighting the potential for increased skepticism.  Instead of fostering informed decisions, blanket labeling could exacerbate existing trust issues on social media.\n\nSecond, mandatory labeling places undue burdens on social media companies. Implementing and enforcing such a system at scale is technically complex and resource-intensive.  The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) argues that current labeling mandates fall short due to impractical implementation challenges [6].  KSolves [15] details the significant costs associated with data labeling, training, and maintenance of AI detection systems, resources that could be better allocated to more effective content moderation strategies.  This burden disproportionately affects smaller platforms, hindering competition and innovation.\n\nThird, alternative solutions are more promising. Instead of focusing on a potentially ineffective and burdensome labeling mandate, we should prioritize media literacy initiatives that empower users to critically evaluate information online, regardless of its source.  Additionally, investing in robust AI detection technologies and encouraging voluntary industry standards for disclosure offer more flexible and adaptable approaches [8].  These solutions can address the underlying concerns about harmful content without the drawbacks of mandatory labeling.\n\n\nIn conclusion, mandatory labeling of AI-generated content is a blunt instrument that fails to address the nuances of online information and may even exacerbate existing problems. A more effective approach involves empowering users through media literacy, improving detection technologies, and fostering responsible industry practices.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.

      "content": "My opponent argues against labeling AI-generated content, claiming it's ineffective and burdensome. However, their arguments fail to recognize the fundamental value of transparency and the potential of informed decision-making.  Let\u2019s dissect their claims.\n\nThey begin by saying labeling is ineffective, citing the MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.  They claim it doesn't address the core issue of truthfulness and can lead to a \"liar's dividend.\" While verifying truthfulness is indeed a complex issue, labeling provides a crucial first step.  It empowers you, the user, to approach content with a discerning eye, knowing its origin and potential biases.  This is not about eliminating misinformation entirely, but about giving you, the consumer, the tools you need to navigate the complexities of the digital age. Think about it: if you see a label clearly indicating a piece of content is AI-generated, you're more likely to critically evaluate its claims, rather than accepting them at face value.  This is the foundation of informed decision-making, and labeling provides that foundation. [1, 2]\n\nFurthermore, their citation of the YouGov study, which found 48% of respondents would distrust AI-generated content, actually strengthens our case.  This highlights a pre-existing skepticism towards AI content, a skepticism that can only be addressed through greater transparency. Labeling doesn't create distrust; it acknowledges it, and allows for a more open and honest conversation about the role of AI in our information ecosystem.  What\u2019s particularly important here is not to shy away from this skepticism, but to embrace it as an opportunity for education and critical engagement.\n\nThis brings me to their second point about the burden on social media companies.  They cite the ITIF and KSolves, arguing that implementation is complex and costly.  While there will undoubtedly be costs associated with implementing labeling systems, these are investments in a more responsible and sustainable digital future.  Consider this:  social media companies already invest heavily in content moderation systems to combat spam, hate speech, and other harmful content.  Labeling AI-generated content is a natural extension of these efforts, contributing to a healthier online environment. [3, 4] The crucial issue here is not whether labeling is costly, but whether the cost of inaction is greater.  The potential harms of unchecked AI-generated content, including the spread of misinformation and manipulation, far outweigh the investment required for labeling.\n\nFinally, they propose alternative solutions like media literacy initiatives and voluntary industry standards.  While these are valuable additions to the conversation, they do not replace the need for clear labeling. Media literacy is essential, but it's not a silver bullet.  Think of it this way:  you are taught to read food labels to understand nutritional content, but it's the presence of those labels, mandated by law, that ensures you have access to that information.  Similarly, while voluntary industry standards can play a role, mandatory labeling provides a baseline level of transparency that all platforms must adhere to. [5]\n\nIn conclusion, our opponents have presented a vision of the internet where users are left to navigate a minefield of unlabeled, potentially deceptive content, relying solely on their own critical thinking skills.  We, on the other hand, advocate for a future where transparency empowers users with the knowledge they need to engage critically with the digital world.  Labeling is not a perfect solution, but it is a necessary step towards a more responsible and informed online environment.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals, while seemingly addressing our concerns, fail to recognize the fundamental distinctions between healthy skepticism and blanket distrust, the disproportionate burden on smaller platforms, and the superior effectiveness of alternative solutions. Furthermore, we must first address a critical difference in how we define \u201cAI-generated content\u201d and our judging criteria.\n\nThe affirmative defines labeling as applying to \"all AI-generated content,\" including content only *partially* generated by AI.  We find this definition overly broad and practically impossible to implement. How do we determine the threshold for \u201cpartial\u201d generation?  Requiring social media companies to police the precise percentage of AI contribution in every piece of content is not only unrealistic but also opens the door to endless disputes and appeals. We propose a more reasonable definition, focusing on content where AI plays the *primary* role in its creation.  This clarifies the scope of the debate and allows for a more focused discussion on practical solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmative proposes \u201cinformed and responsible online environment\u201d as judging criteria.  This is subjective and difficult to quantify. We believe the more appropriate criteria is minimizing harm and maximizing benefit.  This provides a clear and objective standard for evaluating the proposed policy.\n\nNow, turning to their rebuttals, the affirmative claims that \"labeling provides a crucial first step towards transparency, empowering users to be discerning.\" However, studies show that labeling, rather than promoting informed decision-making, exacerbates existing distrust, creating a chilling effect on online discourse [1].  While some skepticism is healthy, labeling fosters blanket distrust, where users dismiss content simply because of its AI origin, regardless of its actual veracity [2].  Imagine a small startup, already struggling to compete with larger platforms, now burdened with the exorbitant costs of implementing and maintaining complex AI detection and labeling systems. This stifles innovation and reinforces the dominance of established players.  Therefore, the affirmative's claim that labeling promotes informed decision-making is demonstrably false, and actively harmful to the online ecosystem.\n\nThe affirmative acknowledges the costs of implementing labeling, stating that these are \"investments in a more responsible and sustainable digital future.\" However, they fail to recognize the scale and complexity of building and maintaining AI detection systems across all content types [3].  Research suggests these costs are significantly higher than traditional content moderation efforts, potentially diverting crucial resources away from more effective strategies like improving AI detection technologies.  For example, a small social media company might have to choose between complying with expensive labeling mandates and investing in crucial security upgrades, ultimately harming users.  Therefore, the affirmative\u2019s attempt to minimize the financial and computational burden of their proposal is unconvincing.\n\nFinally, the affirmative attempts to downplay the efficacy of alternative solutions, arguing that they \u201cdo not replace the need for clear labeling.\u201d They use the analogy of food labels, arguing that mandatory labeling provides a baseline level of transparency.  However, this analogy is fundamentally flawed.  Online information requires critical thinking and evaluation, not just simple labels.  Unlike checking the sugar content on a cereal box, navigating the digital landscape necessitates nuanced judgment and critical analysis\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Pennycook, G., Epstein, Z., Mosleh, M., Arechar, A.

Wiley led the famous \"Poison Squad\" experiment; volunteers ate meals laced with chemical preservatives to test their effects on human health. His studies revealed the dangers of unregulated food additives and sparked public awareness about the importance of knowing what was in the food they consumed. But it wasn\u2019t until almost 90 years later that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act made it mandatory for companies to disclose what was really inside the boxes, cans, and bags that lined grocery store shelves in the U.S. Suddenly, consumers had clear information to help them make healthier choices. Fast-forward to today, and it\u2019s hard to imagine navigating a supermarket without these labels. Yet when we browse the internet\u2014another essential marketplace in our lives\u2014there is little guidance about what we are \u201cconsuming\u201d with each click. We\u2019re absorbing vast amounts of digital information, often without any idea of its emotional or mental \u201cnutritional value.\u201d But what if every webpage came with a content label, offering insight into its potential emotional impact, knowledge value, and practical usefulness?

The FTC's mandate under the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, as well as other content labeling requirements and the trend towards more disclosure in the online world like FTC Endorsement Guides and laws around sponsored content, demonstrates a clear regulatory movement toward transparency.  The need for consumer protection against deceptive practices drives regulations, and this same rationale applies to AI-generated content. Failure to properly disclose origins of AI-generated content, especially given its increasing sophistication, creates potential for misinformation and manipulation, mirroring the problems labeling laws were originally designed to address.",

Trust forms the bedrock of the creator-audience relationship. When a blog post, social post, podcast, video, or any other form of media is an authentic opinion piece, it holds more value than a straightforward paid advertisement. This fact is not lost on advertisers or content creators. 90% of people skip or ignore ads \u2014 be they video ads before content or display ads within content. Sponsoring creator content is one way advertisers can tap into the authenticity and value of organic content. Nothing wrong with that! However, if the fact that the content was sponsored is not disclosed\u2026 well, there\u2019s something wrong with that. Aside from eroding trust, failing to disclose sponsored",

How Can I Meet These as a Creator? Staying informed on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines is a must if you\u2019re a creator. While these guidelines can often be confusing, staying informed on them is a must when it comes to recommending or endorsing products on behalf of brands. These are more than rules. They are the foundation of maintaining transparency and trust with your audience. And these can change as the space evolves, making it hard to keep up.\u00a0 But don\u2019t worry, this guide will break down the FTC guidelines creators need to know. We\u2019ll also cover how to put these into action in your next branded post to keep your content compliant and ethical. Why Do FTC Guidelines Matter? The FTC guidelines protect consumers from misleading advertising. As a creator, your endorsements are powerful and as you may know, influential.\u00a0 When a relationship with a brand is not disclosed, it can mislead your followers and affect their purchasing decisions. Following these guidelines prevents legal repercussions and builds trust with your audience. Adhering to the FTC guidelines is non-negotiable in the world of influencer marketing. Honest and consistent disclosures will help build a loyal and trusting audience. Remember, your credibility is everything.\u00a0 Looking to tap into brand collabs?

The FPLA mandates labeling for consumer commodities to prevent consumer deception regarding \"net contents, identity of commodity, and name and place of business.\" This focus on transparency and accurate information directly applies to the digital age. AI-generated content, if presented without clear labeling, can deceive consumers about its origin and nature, much like mislabeled products. It is crucial for consumers to discern between human-created and AI-generated content to assess authenticity and potential biases. While some might argue that labeling infringes on free speech, the FPLA demonstrates that labeling requirements can be implemented without violating these rights. It is a matter of ensuring consumers have the necessary information to make informed decisions, not of censoring content. Furthermore, the rise of deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content amplifies the need for labeling,  highlighting the potential for widespread misinformation if origins are obscured.",

Log In Sign Up Home Opinion Artificial Intelligence The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling of AI-Generated Media by Alex Cooke December 27, 2024 16 Comments Facebook X 16 Comments In the digital age, information flows at speeds and scales that are unprecedented in human history. Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency.

Download Quick Read CNTI\u2019s Summary Deepfakes, a form of synthetic media content that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic depictions of people and events, have proliferated in recent years. There are many questions about how this content affects journalists, fact-based news and mis- and disinformation. In addressing these concerns it is important to consider freedom of expression and safety. Relatedly, policies targeting deepfakes must be clear about what types of content qualify as such. Detection technologies and provenance approaches are being rapidly developed but it is unlikely they can prevent all potential harms by AI-altered content. Additional research should consider (1) what effects deepfakes have on journalism, (2) how content labeling addresses concerns about deepfakes (and what types are most effective), (3) what international standards should be applied to content to confirm its authenticity and (4) how best to teach the public to identify synthetic media.

Log In Sign Up Home Opinion Artificial Intelligence The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling of AI-Generated Media by Alex Cooke December 27, 2024 16 Comments Facebook X 16 Comments In the digital age, information flows at speeds and scales that are unprecedented in human history. Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency.

As \"Aithenticate.org\" points out, platforms like Facebook have implemented AI labels to inform users about the origin of content, fostering trust by clearly identifying AI's role. This transparency holds content creators accountable and allows users to make informed decisions, contributing to a more responsible social media environment.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Labeling aligns with existing regulations and legal frameworks for content labeling and disclosure.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '9_0', 'query': 'US regulations for content labeling and disclosure', 'title': 'Fair Packaging and Labeling Act: Regulations Under Section ...', 'url': 'https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-packaging-labeling-act-regulations-under-section-4-fair-packaging-labeling-act'}, {'id': '9_1', 'query': 'US regulations for content labeling and disclosure', 'title': 'United States Product Labeling Requirements', 'url': 'https://www.compliancegate.com/united-states-product-labeling-requirements/'}, {'id': '9_41', 'query': 'Specific regulations for labeling AI-generated content', 'title': 'The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling ...', 'url': 'https://fstoppers.com/artificial-intelligence/critical-necessity-immediate-regulation-and-labeling-ai-generated-media-688199'}, {'id': '9_45', 'query': 'Regulations for labeling synthetic media', 'title': 'Synthetic Media & Deepfakes', 'url': 'https://innovating.news/article/synthetic-media-deepfakes/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) provides a strong precedent for labeling AI-generated content.  The FPLA mandates labeling for consumer commodities to prevent consumer deception regarding \"net contents, identity of commodity, and name and place of business.\" This focus on transparency and accurate information directly applies to the digital age. AI-generated content, if presented without clear labeling, can deceive consumers about its origin and nature, much like mislabeled products. It is crucial for consumers to discern between human-created and AI-generated content to assess authenticity and potential biases. While some might argue that labeling infringes on free speech, the FPLA demonstrates that labeling requirements can be implemented without violating these rights. It is a matter of ensuring consumers have the necessary information to make informed decisions, not of censoring content. Furthermore, the rise of deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content amplifies the need for labeling,  highlighting the potential for widespread misinformation if origins are obscured.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Labeling helps policymakers understand the impact of AI-generated content on society.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_0', 'query': 'Benefits of labeling AI generated content for policymakers', 'title': 'Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions - MIT Media Lab', 'url': 'https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/labeling-ai-generated-content-promises-perils-and-future-directions/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Labeling AI-generated content allows policymakers to track its spread and assess its influence on public discourse, misinformation, and other societal issues.  As the MIT Media Lab study (\"8_0\") suggests, labeling helps inform the public about AI-generated media. This awareness is crucial for informed policy decisions regarding AI's societal impact.\n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand firmly in support of the motion: Social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content.  We believe this is a crucial step towards a more transparent, accountable, and ultimately safer online environment. Let\u2019s first clarify what we mean by this motion.\n\nSocial media companies, the platforms enabling us to share and connect with others online, must clearly label all AI-generated content.  This includes any text, image, audio, or video created wholly or partially by AI, regardless of who posts it.  Think of it like the labels we already see for sponsored posts or political ads\u2014clear, readily visible, and consistent across platforms.  These labels will be enforced by regulatory bodies like the FTC, ensuring compliance through audits and penalties.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will labeling AI-generated content contribute to a more informed and responsible online environment? We believe the answer is a resounding yes. Consider this:  when you scroll through your feed, wouldn\u2019t you want to know if what you're seeing is a genuine human expression or the product of an algorithm?\n\nLet me turn to our first argument: Labeling fosters greater transparency and accountability.  Platforms like Facebook have already begun labeling some AI-generated content, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of this practice. As you'll see, when you know a piece of content is AI-generated, you can engage with it more critically, questioning its potential biases or inaccuracies. This transparency holds creators accountable and empowers you, the user, to make informed decisions about the information you consume. [1]\n\nThis brings me to our second, and arguably most crucial, argument: Labeling aligns with existing regulations and legal frameworks. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires clear labeling for consumer products to prevent deception.  This principle of transparency applies equally to the digital world.  AI-generated content, if unlabeled, can mislead you, the consumer, about its origins and nature. Just as you have a right to know what\u2019s in the food you buy, you deserve to know whether the content you're consuming is human-created or AI-generated. [2, 3, 4, 5]  The crucial issue here is not censorship, but informed consumption. It's about empowering you to navigate the digital landscape with the knowledge you need to make informed choices.  Moreover, the rise of deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content underscores the urgency of this issue. Without clear labeling, the potential for widespread misinformation is immense, threatening the very fabric of our shared reality.\n\nFinally, what's particularly important is that labeling helps policymakers understand the impact of AI-generated content on society.  By tracking the prevalence and influence of AI-generated content, policymakers can make data-driven decisions to mitigate potential harms. This allows for informed regulation and the development of strategies to address issues like misinformation and manipulation. The MIT Media Lab emphasizes the importance of such labeling for informed policymaking in the age of AI.  [6]\n\nIn conclusion, requiring social media companies to label AI-generated content is not just a good idea; it's a necessary step to safeguard the integrity of our online spaces.  It empowers you, the user, with crucial information, fosters accountability, and provides policymakers with the data they need to navigate the evolving digital landscape. We urge you to support this motion for a more transparent and responsible online future.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Facebook AI Label: Enhancing Transparency and Trust in Social Media Content.  https://aithenticate.org/artificial-intelligence/facebook-ai-label-enhancing-transparency-and-trust-in-social-media-content/\n[2] Fair Packaging and Labeling Act: Regulations Under Section ...  https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-packaging-labeling-act-regulations-under-section-4-fair-packaging-labeling-act\n[3] United States Product Labeling Requirements. https://www.compliancegate.com/united-states-product-labeling-requirements/\n[4] The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling ... https://fstoppers.com/artificial-intelligence/critical-necessity-immediate-regulation-and-labeling-ai-generated-media-688199\n[5] Synthetic Media & Deepfakes. https://innovating.news/article/synthetic-media-deepfakes/\n[6] Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions - MIT Media Lab. https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/labeling-ai-generated-content-promises-perils-and-future-directions/\n",

        "statements": "In this debate, we shall argue against the proposition that social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content.  We define AI-generated content as any content created primarily by artificial intelligence tools, encompassing text, images, audio, and video. Social media companies are defined as platforms facilitating the creation and sharing of information via virtual communities and networks. Labeling refers to a clear and easily identifiable mark or disclosure on a piece of content indicating its origin as AI-generated.\n\nOur judging criteria is minimizing harm and maximizing benefit. The optimal approach minimizes potential harms while maximizing the benefits of AI-generated content. This framework allows us to weigh both the potential negative consequences of unregulated AI content and the potential stifling of innovation from overly restrictive policies. We contend that mandatory labeling does more harm than good.\n\nFirst, mandatory labeling is ineffective and potentially counterproductive.  While proponents argue labeling increases transparency, research from the MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab [1] suggests that simply labeling content as AI-generated doesn't address the core issue of verifying its truthfulness or harmfulness. This can lead to a \"liar's dividend,\" where widespread skepticism towards all content undermines trust in authentic sources [1].  A study by YouGov [10] found that 48% of respondents would distrust content labeled as AI-generated, highlighting the potential for increased skepticism.  Instead of fostering informed decisions, blanket labeling could exacerbate existing trust issues on social media.\n\nSecond, mandatory labeling places undue burdens on social media companies. Implementing and enforcing such a system at scale is technically complex and resource-intensive.  The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) argues that current labeling mandates fall short due to impractical implementation challenges [6].  KSolves [15] details the significant costs associated with data labeling, training, and maintenance of AI detection systems, resources that could be better allocated to more effective content moderation strategies.  This burden disproportionately affects smaller platforms, hindering competition and innovation.\n\nThird, alternative solutions are more promising. Instead of focusing on a potentially ineffective and burdensome labeling mandate, we should prioritize media literacy initiatives that empower users to critically evaluate information online, regardless of its source.  Additionally, investing in robust AI detection technologies and encouraging voluntary industry standards for disclosure offer more flexible and adaptable approaches [8].  These solutions can address the underlying concerns about harmful content without the drawbacks of mandatory labeling.\n\n\nIn conclusion, mandatory labeling of AI-generated content is a blunt instrument that fails to address the nuances of online information and may even exacerbate existing problems. A more effective approach involves empowering users through media literacy, improving detection technologies, and fostering responsible industry practices.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.

However, their arguments fail to recognize the fundamental value of transparency and the potential of informed decision-making.  Let\u2019s dissect their claims.\n\nThey begin by saying labeling is ineffective, citing the MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.  They claim it doesn't address the core issue of truthfulness and can lead to a \"liar's dividend.\" While verifying truthfulness is indeed a complex issue, labeling provides a crucial first step.  It empowers you, the user, to approach content with a discerning eye, knowing its origin and potential biases.  This is not about eliminating misinformation entirely, but about giving you, the consumer, the tools you need to navigate the complexities of the digital age. Think about it: if you see a label clearly indicating a piece of content is AI-generated, you're more likely to critically evaluate its claims, rather than accepting them at face value.  This is the foundation of informed decision-making, and labeling provides that foundation. [1, 2]\n\nFurthermore, their citation of the YouGov study, which found 48% of respondents would distrust AI-generated content, actually strengthens our case.  This highlights a pre-existing skepticism towards AI content, a skepticism that can only be addressed through greater transparency. Labeling doesn't create distrust; it acknowledges it, and allows for a more open and honest conversation about the role of AI in our information ecosystem.  What\u2019s particularly important here is not to shy away from this skepticism, but to embrace it as an opportunity for education and critical engagement.\n\nThis brings me to their second point about the burden on social media companies.  They cite the ITIF and KSolves, arguing that implementation is complex and costly.  While there will undoubtedly be costs associated with implementing labeling systems, these are investments in a more responsible and sustainable digital future.  Consider this:  social media companies already invest heavily in content moderation systems to combat spam, hate speech, and other harmful content.  Labeling AI-generated content is a natural extension of these efforts, contributing to a healthier online environment. [3, 4] The crucial issue here is not whether labeling is costly, but whether the cost of inaction is greater.  The potential harms of unchecked AI-generated content, including the spread of misinformation and manipulation, far outweigh the investment required for labeling.\n\nFinally, they propose alternative solutions like media literacy initiatives and voluntary industry standards.  While these are valuable additions to the conversation, they do not replace the need for clear labeling. Media literacy is essential, but it's not a silver bullet.  Think of it this way:  you are taught to read food labels to understand nutritional content, but it's the presence of those labels, mandated by law, that ensures you have access to that information.  Similarly, while voluntary industry standards can play a role, mandatory labeling provides a baseline level of transparency that all platforms must adhere to. [5]\n\nIn conclusion, our opponents have presented a vision of the internet where users are left to navigate a minefield of unlabeled, potentially deceptive content, relying solely on their own critical thinking skills.  We, on the other hand, advocate for a future where transparency empowers users with the knowledge they need to engage critically with the digital world.  Labeling is not a perfect solution, but it is a necessary step towards a more responsible and informed online environment.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.

        "statements": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals, while seemingly addressing our concerns, fail to recognize the fundamental distinctions between healthy skepticism and blanket distrust, the disproportionate burden on smaller platforms, and the superior effectiveness of alternative solutions. Furthermore, we must first address a critical difference in how we define \u201cAI-generated content\u201d and our judging criteria.\n\nThe affirmative defines labeling as applying to \"all AI-generated content,\" including content only *partially* generated by AI.  We find this definition overly broad and practically impossible to implement. How do we determine the threshold for \u201cpartial\u201d generation?  Requiring social media companies to police the precise percentage of AI contribution in every piece of content is not only unrealistic but also opens the door to endless disputes and appeals. We propose a more reasonable definition, focusing on content where AI plays the *primary* role in its creation.  This clarifies the scope of the debate and allows for a more focused discussion on practical solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmative proposes \u201cinformed and responsible online environment\u201d as judging criteria.  This is subjective and difficult to quantify. We believe the more appropriate criteria is minimizing harm and maximizing benefit.  This provides a clear and objective standard for evaluating the proposed policy.\n\nNow, turning to their rebuttals, the affirmative claims that \"labeling provides a crucial first step towards transparency, empowering users to be discerning.\" However, studies show that labeling, rather than promoting informed decision-making, exacerbates existing distrust, creating a chilling effect on online discourse [1].  While some skepticism is healthy, labeling fosters blanket distrust, where users dismiss content simply because of its AI origin, regardless of its actual veracity [2].  Imagine a small startup, already struggling to compete with larger platforms, now burdened with the exorbitant costs of implementing and maintaining complex AI detection and labeling systems. This stifles innovation and reinforces the dominance of established players.  Therefore, the affirmative's claim that labeling promotes informed decision-making is demonstrably false, and actively harmful to the online ecosystem.\n\nThe affirmative acknowledges the costs of implementing labeling, stating that these are \"investments in a more responsible and sustainable digital future.\" However, they fail to recognize the scale and complexity of building and maintaining AI detection systems across all content types [3].  Research suggests these costs are significantly higher than traditional content moderation efforts, potentially diverting crucial resources away from more effective strategies like improving AI detection technologies.  For example, a small social media company might have to choose between complying with expensive labeling mandates and investing in crucial security upgrades, ultimately harming users.  Therefore, the affirmative\u2019s attempt to minimize the financial and computational burden of their proposal is unconvincing.\n\nFinally, the affirmative attempts to downplay the efficacy of alternative solutions, arguing that they \u201cdo not replace the need for clear labeling.\u201d They use the analogy of food labels, arguing that mandatory labeling provides a baseline level of transparency.  However, this analogy is fundamentally flawed.  Online information requires critical thinking and evaluation, not just simple labels.  Unlike checking the sugar content on a cereal box, navigating the digital landscape necessitates nuanced judgment and critical analysis\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Pennycook, G., Epstein, Z., Mosleh, M., Arechar, A.

Wiley led the famous \"Poison Squad\" experiment; volunteers ate meals laced with chemical preservatives to test their effects on human health. His studies revealed the dangers of unregulated food additives and sparked public awareness about the importance of knowing what was in the food they consumed. But it wasn\u2019t until almost 90 years later that the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act made it mandatory for companies to disclose what was really inside the boxes, cans, and bags that lined grocery store shelves in the U.S. Suddenly, consumers had clear information to help them make healthier choices. Fast-forward to today, and it\u2019s hard to imagine navigating a supermarket without these labels. Yet when we browse the internet\u2014another essential marketplace in our lives\u2014there is little guidance about what we are \u201cconsuming\u201d with each click. We\u2019re absorbing vast amounts of digital information, often without any idea of its emotional or mental \u201cnutritional value.\u201d But what if every webpage came with a content label, offering insight into its potential emotional impact, knowledge value, and practical usefulness?

From concerns about smartphone addiction to questions about algorithmic influence on our preferences, worries about data privacy, it's safe to say that the state of social media has been far from ideal. As we navigate through these turbulent digital waters, it's easy to find plenty of reasons to harbor a certain level of disdain for social platforms. I get it; I'm right there with you. There's a part of me that genuinely dislikes social media for all the same reasons. It can be a time-consuming nuisance, and trust in those tech giants can be hard to come by. Many of us would prefer to focus on our artistic endeavors, eschewing the digital noise that can often leave us feeling disconnected and misunderstood. Perhaps you've tweeted into the void, wondering if anyone out there is even listening. Maybe you've felt the algorithm's cold shoulder, seemingly ignoring your efforts. If any of this resonates with you, then you're not alone \u2013 you're like me. But here's the twist: despite our shared distaste for certain aspects of social media, I firmly believe it can serve as a potent tool for us in the music industry, especially as indie record labels. I'm here to tell you why you should embrace social media as a record label, regardless of your personal feelings or aspirations of becoming an influencer.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Americans are pervasively exposed to social media, news, and online content. Some of this content is designed to be deliberately deceptive and manipulative. However, it is interspersed amongst other content from friends and family, advertising, and legitimate news. Filtering content violates key societal values of freedom of expression and inquiry. Taking no action, though, leaves users at the mercy of individuals and groups who seek to use both single articles and complex patterns of content to manipulate how Americans consume, act, work, and even think. Warning labels, which do not block content but instead aid the user in making informed consumption decisions, have been proposed as a potential solution to this dilemma. Ideally, they would respect the autonomy of users to determine what media they consume while combating intentional deception and manipulation through its identification to the user. This paper considers the perception of Americans regarding the use of warning labels to alert users to potentially deceptive content. It presents the results of a population representative national study and analysis of perceptions in terms of key demographics. Keywords: online med",

U.S. Surgeon General Wants a Warning Label for Social Media, How it Could Work U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, M.D, is calling for Congress to put a warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media poses a harm to the mental health of children and teens. \u201cThe mental health crisis among young people is an emergency \u2014 and social media has emerged as an important contributor,\u201d Murthy said in an op-ed in The New York Times June 17. Murthy cited research published in JAMA Psychiatry showing that teens who spend more than three hours a day using social media have double the risk of mental health problems, including depression and anxiety. Other research found that 46% of adolescents said social media made them feel worse about their bodies, while 32% said social media negatively affected their grades in school. American teens spend an average of 4.8 hours a day on social media platforms like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube, according to a 2023 Gallup poll. Over half reported using social media for at least four hours per day, the poll shows. What a warning label can do A warning label, which would require congressional action, \u201cwould regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe,\u201d Murthy wrote in The New York Times. Joseph Trunzo, PhD, a professor of psychology at Bryant University, said the Surgeon General\u2019s proposal is a good move. \u201cI\u2019m in support of anything we can do to raise awareness of the potential dangers of social media, particularly for our youth,\u201d Trunzo told Healthline.

Some of the top takeaways from the report include: A full 85 percent of survey respondents claimed they will be more likely to give the company a second chance after a bad experience if that company has a history of transparency. Likewise, 85 percent of respondents said they are more likely to remain loyal to a brand during a crisis if that company has been known to be transparent. Nearly 9 out of 10 peop",

Data breaches. Privacy concerns. In our hyper-connected, hyper-complicated world, there\u2019s always a question of whether what you see online is accurate or the whole story. People shop and consume information with a healthy dose of skepticism, and brands are fighting an uphill battle to earn the trust\u2014and business\u2014of today\u2019s consumer. The era of distrust is driving demand for greater transparency from power players, brands included, and setting new communication standards. To understand this evolution and the state of transparency in brand-customer relationships, Sprout Social surveyed 1,000 U.S. consumers on their transparency beliefs, expectations and desires to develop this study, From Risk to Responsibility: Social Media and the Evolution of Transparency. First and foremost, our research found that 86% of Americans say transparency from businesses is more important than ever before. Thanks to the growth of social media, brands and consumers have unprecedented access to each other. While this intimate connection fuels amazing experiences, it also puts additional responsibility on everyone involved. Consumers\u2019 cards are on the table\u2014they want more transparency, now. It\u2019s time for brands to step up to the plate and deliver. To avoid striking out, it\u2019s important for decision makers to know what they\u2019re aiming for. What does transparency actually mean to the general public? The largest number of people say transparency is when businesses are open (59%), clear (53%) and honest (49%). These guiding principles give a sense of what consumers are looking for, and they make it clear that there\u2019s more than one way to demonstrate transparency as a business. Although companies should leverage multiple communication channels to make good on the interest in more transparency, this study proves no channel is better suited than social media to forge real connec",

With PAI, we provide guidance for labelling them. By Emily Saltz, Tommy Shane, Victoria Kwan, Claire Leibowicz, Claire Wardle. This post has been republished with permission by the Partnership on AI. The original post was published on Medium. Manipulated photos and videos flood our fragmented, polluted, and increasingly automated information ecosystem, from a synthetically generated \u201cdeepfake,\u201d to the far more common problem of older images resurfacing and being shared with a different context. While research is still limited, there is some empirical support to show visuals tend to be both\u00a0more memorable\u00a0and\u00a0more widely shared than text-only posts, heightening their potential to cause real-world harm, at scale. Consider the numerous audiovisual examples in this running list of hoaxes and misleading posts\u00a0about police brutality protests in the United States. In response, what should social media platforms do? Twitter, Facebook, and others have been working on new ways to identify and label manipulated media. Label designs aren\u2019t applied in a vacuum, as the divisive reactions to Twitter\u2019s recent decision to label two of Trump\u2019s misleading and incendiary tweets demonstrate. In one instance, the platform appended a label under a tweet that contained incorrect information about California\u2019s absentee ballot process, encouraging readers to click through and \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots.\u201d In the other instance, Twitter replaced the text of\u00a0a tweet referring to shooting of looters with a label that says: \u201cThis tweet violates the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.\u201d Twitter determined that it was in the public interest for the tweet to remain accessible and this label allowed users the opti",

Too many people, especially the young, are co-dependent on social media, rather than establishing themselves in the real world. It\u2019s hard for me to believe that anyone, for example, takes the term \u201csocial media influencer\u201d seriously. It is the infantilization of young adults who might otherwise actually contribute to their society.

Surgeon General sparks conversation June 18, 2024 \u2022 News, By Mary Sell The U.S. surgeon general has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms and their effects on young people\u2019s lives, similar to those now mandatory on cigarette boxes. In a Monday opinion piece in the The New York Times, Dr. Vivek Murthy said that social media is a contributing factor in the mental health crisis among young people. \u201cIt is time to require a surgeon general\u2019s warning label on social media platforms, stating that social media is associated with significant mental health harms for adolescents. A surgeon general\u2019s warning label, which requires congressional action, would regularly remind parents and adolescents that social media has not been proved safe,\u201d Murthy said. \u201cEvidence from tobacco studies show that warning labels can increase awareness and change behavior.\u201d Murthy said that the use of just a warning label wouldn\u2019t make social media safe for young people, but would be a part of the steps needed. His stance drew support from U.S. Senator Katie Britt, R-Alabama. \u201c(Surgeon General Murphy) is correct \u2014 America\u2019s youth mental health crisis is an emergency, requiring urgent bipartisan action,\u201d Britt wrote on Monday. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve joined (Sens. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, Ted Cruz, R-Texas, and Chris Murphy, R-Arkansas) in introducing the Kids Off Social Media Act.\u201d Last year, Britt and her colleagues introduced a bill to prohibit all children under the age of 13 from using social media and would require permission from",

The notion of authenticity (i.e., the accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of content) becomes particularly fraught in the context of content made using generative AI (GenAI) tools [1] such as DALL-E, ChatGPT, or Adobe Firefly. Providing transparency means presenting viewers with clear and understandable information about how content was created, and disclosing the role of AI in that process, if any. Transparency is essential for fostering viewer trust and understanding, as well as for ensuring accountability and support for responsible AI development and deployment. Insights \u2192 AI labeling can be a valuable tool in the fight against mis- and disinformation, helping viewers understand the potential for biases or manipulations. \u2192 Creators wish to demonstrate their creative process, while viewers seek information to inform authenticity perceptions. \u2192 We need participation in industrywide collaborations, adherence to legislative measures, and the integration of provenance information at both the creation and display stages of AI-generated content. Many researchers have explored AI-labeling solutions to support this type of transparency for viewers, which involves providing metadata, tags, or annotations to content produced by AI models [2,3,4]. Such studies have shown that surfacing GenAI labels to consumers with text or graphics displayed on or next to content can be a valuable tool in the fight against mis- and disinformation, helping viewers understand the potential for biases or manipulations in the content they are consuming. For example, Chloe Wittenberg et al. [4] propose a framework for labeling AI-generated media according to the goal that specific labels are intending to accomplish. The authors propose either pro",

Clear labeling helps maintain compliance with SEO practices and avoid penalties. Best practices include developing a transparent AI disclosure strategy and creating consistent labeling across platforms. Labels should be integrated seamlessly to enhance user experience without being disruptive. Understanding and adhering to legal and search engine guidelines is crucial for effective AI content labeling. What Is AI Content Labeling? Imagine you\u2019re reading an article online. You find the information helpful, but something in the back of your mind is curious about who wrote it. This is where AI content labeling comes in. It\u2019s a simple tag or statement that tells you whether the content was generated by a human or an AI. It\u2019s like a food label, but for information, letting you know exactly what you\u2019re consuming. Why It Matters for Your Audience and SEO Most importantly, AI content labeling matters because it builds trust. Your readers want to know if the insights they\u2019re getting are from a person or a machine. But there\u2019s more; search engines are getting smarter, and they care about transparency too. Proper labeling can help your content rank better and avoid penalties, because it aligns with the search engines\u2019 push for clear and honest content. Establishing Clear Labeling Policies Setting up clear policies for AI content labeling isn\u2019t just about slapping a label on your article. It\u2019s about creating a set of rules that guide how and when to disclose AI involvement. This ensures consistency, which is key for building long-term trust ",

The rise of this practice constitutes an important new chapter in social media governance, as companies are often choosing this new \u201cmiddle way\u201d between a laissez-faire approach and more drastic remedies such as removing or downranking content. Yet information labeling as a practice has, thus far, been mostly tactical, reactive, and without strategic underpinnings.

Masullo Associate Director, Knight Faculty Fellow Natalie (Talia) Jomini Stroud Director, Knight Faculty Fellow Newsletter Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \ufeff October 3, 2019 The Center for Media Engagement wanted to find out if labeling news stories (using labels such as news, analysis, opinion, or sponsored content) increases trust. We tested two different types of labels \u2013 above-story labels and in-story labels. We also evaluated whether readers noticed and remembered the labels. We found that neither type of label increased trust. Also, many people didn\u2019t notice or accurately recall the labels, although recall was better for the in-story explainer label. The results suggest that labels aren\u2019t effective on their own, but they may be helpful in conjunction with other techniques for conveying trustworthiness. The Problem Public trust in the news media is lagging.1 Some news organizations have tried to increase trust by using labels \u2013 such as news, analysis, opinion, and sponsored content.2 The idea is that labeling content will make it easier for readers to differentiate, for example, opinion content from news.

One widely adopted intervention by platforms for addressing falsehoods is applying \u201cwarning labels\u201d to posts deemed inaccurate by fact-checkers. Despite a rich literature on correcting misinformation after exposure, much less work has examined the effectiveness of warning labels presented concurrent with exposure. Promisingly, existing research suggests that warning labels effectively reduce belief and spread of misinformation. The size of these beneficial effects depends on how the labels are implemented and the characteristics of the content being labeled. Despite some individual differences, recent evidence indicates that warning labels are generally effective across party lines and other demographic characteristics. We discuss potential implications and limitations of labeling policies for addressing online misinformation. Section snippets Warning labels generally reduce belief and sharing of falsehoods Retrospective self-report data from October 2021 indicate that the majority of Americans (57\u00a0%) recalled seeing a social media post with a warning label attached \u2013 however, they were evenly split on whether or not they thought that the warning label made them less likely to trust the contents of the post [9].

Drawing on a national survey (N = 1,003), we found that U.S. adults evaluated fact-checking labels created by professional fact checkers as more\u00a0effective\u00a0than labels by algorithms and other users.\u00a0News media\u00a0labels were perceived as more effective than user\u00a0labels but not statistically different from labels by fact checkers and algorithms.

Drawing on a national survey (N = 1,003), we found that U.S. adults evaluated fact-checking labels created by professional fact checkers as more\u00a0effective\u00a0than labels by algorithms and other users.\u00a0News media\u00a0labels were perceived as more effective than user\u00a0labels but not statistically different from labels by fact checkers and algorithms.

One widely adopted intervention by platforms for addressing falsehoods is applying \u201cwarning labels\u201d to posts deemed inaccurate by fact-checkers. Despite a rich literature on correcting misinformation after exposure, much less work has examined the effectiveness of warning labels presented concurrent with exposure. Promisingly, existing research suggests that warning labels effectively reduce belief and spread of misinformation. The size of these beneficial effects depends on how the labels are implemented and the characteristics of the content being labeled. Despite some individual differences, recent evidence indicates that warning labels are generally effective across party lines and other demographic characteristics. We discuss potential implications and limitations of labeling policies for addressing online misinformation. Section snippets Warning labels generally reduce belief and sharing of falsehoods Retrospective self-report data from October 2021 indicate that the majority of Americans (57\u00a0%) recalled seeing a social media post with a warning label attached \u2013 however, they were evenly split on whether or not they thought that the warning label made them less likely to trust the contents of the post [9].

It\u2019s how brands make their first and long-lasting impressions on social media. And it\u2019s with content that brands communicate and connect with new and loyal customers alike. That's why it's important to know what to post on each social media platform. So in this article, we\u2019ll share the nine most valuable types of social media content according to marketers and how brands are using these formats to strike a chord with audiences. The most engaging types of social media content in 2023 Keeping up with the latest in social media is a difficult task with all the different platforms, features and algorithms. That's why we created The 2023 Content Benchmarks Report to help you identify the most valuable types of social media content. In this report, we collected data from 729,000 public social profiles in 2022. Then, we analyzed trends to derive what types of social media content will inspire your audience and make them more likely to engage with your brand. Let\u2019s take a look at which formats are most engaging. 1. Short-form video Short-form videos are the most captivating type of social media content thanks to their capacity to break down and present information in less than one minute. Plus, the length makes it more shareable and ideal for social media. You\u2019re facing an audience that\u2019s busier than ever. People are looking for immediate gratification with fast and entertaining content they can consume on the way. So a 15-minute video seems impractical when a one-minute video can do the job just as well. Why short-form video works on social About 66% of consumers find short-form videos the most engaging o",

Such labeling strategies, which are now being used by most major social platforms, present a host of new challenges and questions. This report, based on a national survey conducted in the U.S. in summer 2021 (N = 1,464), provides new insights into public preferences around social media company policy and interventions in the media environment. It is often assumed that there are highly polari",

                  "raw_content": "ACM Interactions Features Unmasking AI: Informing Authenticity Decisions by Labeling AI-Generated Content The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence technologies has ushered in a transformative era in content creation, and with it, shifting perceptions of what makes content authentic. The notion of authenticity (i.e., the accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of content) becomes particularly fraught in the context of content made using generative AI (GenAI) tools [1] such as DALL-E, ChatGPT, or Adobe Firefly. Providing transparency means presenting viewers with clear and understandable information about how content was created, and disclosing the role of AI in that process, if any. Transparency is essential for fostering viewer trust and understanding, as well as for ensuring accountability and support for responsible AI development and deployment. Insights \u2192 AI labeling can be a valuable tool in the fight against mis- and disinformation, helping viewers understand the potential for biases or manipulations. \u2192 Creators wish to demonstrate their creative process, while viewers seek information to inform authenticity perceptions. \u2192 We need participation in industrywide collaborations, adherence to legislative measures, and the integration of provenance information at both the creation and display stages of AI-generated content. Many researchers have explored AI-labeling solutions to support this type of transparency for viewers, which involves providing metadata, tags, or annotations to content produced by AI models [2,3,4]. Such studies have shown that surfacing GenAI labels to consumers with text or graphics displayed on or next to content can be a valuable tool in the fight against mis- and disinformation, helping viewers understand the potential for biases or manipulations in the content they are consuming. For example, Chloe Wittenberg et al. [4] propose a framework for labeling AI-generated media according to the goal that specific labels are intending to accomplish. The authors propose either pro",

It seeks to understand how content moderation operates as a process of accountability to shape and inform how users (inter)act on social media and how SMOs account for these practices. Design/methodology/approach Content analysis of the content moderation practices for selected SMOs was conducted using a range of publicly available data. Drawing on seminal accountability studies and the concepts of hierarchical and holistic accountability, the authors investigate the design and appearance of the systems of accountability that seek to guide how users create and share content on social media. Findings The paper unpacks the four-stage process of content moderation enacted by the World's largest SMOs. The findings suggest that while social media accountability may allow SMOs to control the content shared on their platforms, it may struggle to condition user behavior. This argument is built around the limitations the authors found in the way performance expectations are communicated to users, the nature of the dialogue that manifests between SMOs and users who are \u201cheld to account\u201d, and the metrics drawn upon to determine the effectiveness of SMOs content moderation activities. Originality/value This is the first paper to examine the content moderation practices of the World's largest SMOs. Doing so extends understanding of the forms of accountability that function in the digital space.

However, such claims can be damaging both to the reputation of the business and to the consumers who rely on the accuracy of advertising to make informed decisions. In order to protect consumers and ensure fair competition in the marketplace, there are strict rules and regulations in place to govern advertising claims. Business owners and marketers must understand and adhere to these guidelines in order to avoid legal repercussions and maintain trust with their customers. Regardless of the type of marketing claims being made or the product being marketed, there are some basic guidelines with which marketers should be familiar. This is the case for every form of marketing or advertising, including digital and audio forms, print materials, and even sponsorships. It is also in relation to marketing and advertising claims which are expressly made, and those claims which are implied. Express marketing claims are those that are specifically and directly stated in an advertisement or marketing material. They are explicit and leave no room for interpretation. For example, a claim that a product will \"whiten teeth in just one use\" is an express claim. Implied marketing claims, on the other hand, are those that are suggested or implied by the advertisement or marketing material, but not directly stated. They may rely on subtler language, images, or implications to make an impression on the consumer. For example, an advertisement for a luxury car that shows a couple driving through a picturesque mountain road may imply that the car is high-end, sophisticated, and stylish, without explicitly stating those claims. Both express and implied marketing claims must be truthful and non-deceptive, and advertisers must be able to substantiat",

Summary There is a broad array of EU legislation pertaining to the marking, labeling, and packaging of products in the European Union.\u00a0 The first step in investigating the marking, labeling, and packaging legislation that might apply to a product entering the European Union is to draw a distinction between what is mandatory and what is voluntary.\u00a0 Decisions related to mandatory marking, labeling, or packaging requirements may sometimes be left up to individual Member States.\u00a0 Furthermore, voluntary marks and labels are used as marketing tools in some Member States but not in others.\u00a0 This section is focused primarily on the mandatory marks and labels seen most often on consumer products and packaging, which are typically related to public safety, health, or environmental concerns.\u00a0 It also includes a brief overview of a few mandatory packaging requirements, as well as more common voluntary marks or labels used in EU markets. It is also important to distinguish between marks and labels.\u00a0 A mark is a symbol and/or pictogram that appears on a product or its respective packaging.\u00a0 These range in scope from signs of danger to indications of methods of proper recycling and disposal.\u00a0 The intention of such marks is to provide market surveillance authorities, importers, distributors, and end users with information concerning safety, health, energy efficiency and environmental issues relating to a product.\u00a0 Labels, on the other hand, appear in the form of written text or numerical statements, which may be required but are not necessarily universally recognizable.\u00a0 Labels typically indicate more specific information about a product, such as measurements or an indication of materials that may be found in the product (such as in texti",

Abstract Background In recent years, skin reactions secondary to the use of medical devices (MD), such as allergic contact dermatitis have increasingly been observed (e.g. to continuous blood sugar monitoring systems, insulin pumps, wound dressings, medical gloves, etc.): this is regarded as a developing epidemic. Lack of labelling of the composition of MD, as well as frequent lack of cooperation of manufacturers to disclose this relevant information, even when contacted by the clinician for the individual case of an established adverse reaction, significantly impede patient care. Objectives To advocate for full ingredient labelling in the implementation of EU regulation for MD. Methods This position paper reviews the scientific literature, the current regulatory framework adopted for MD to date, and the likely impact, including some costs data in case of the absence of such labelling.

By Miami Law Blog Contributor 11-22-2024 Digital marketing remains among the most effective ways for businesses to reach their target audiences. From social media and email to paid advertisements and every tool in between, marketing professionals have no shortage of options for getting a message out into the digital world. At the same time,\u00a0ethical and\u00a0legal issues in digital marketing\u00a0have also become increasingly common in recent years. More than ever, marketing professionals have a responsibility to understand the dynamic landscape of digital marketing ethics and the legal frameworks surrounding this field. If you are in marketing and are looking for a way to improve your own understanding of digital marketing laws, compliance, and risk mitigation in digital marketing campaigns, a Master of Legal Studies (M.L.S.) degree program can help you do just that. The Landscape of Digital Marketing Ethics Digital marketing professionals must understand the ever-changing landscape of digital marketing ethics, especially as it relates to issues like data privacy, authenticity, informed consent, and transparency. With a better grasp of what digital marketing ethics entail and why they matter in the digital space, marketing professionals can make better-informed decisions that prioritize ethics and respect in their campaigns. Defining Digital Marketing Ethics What is digital marketing ethics, anyway? In simplest terms, it may be best to think of ethics in digital marketing as the moral guidelines or principles that marketing teams rely upon to make decisions about their campaigns. This may include important decisions about how marketing professionals collect and use data, protect user privacy, and even make claims about their brand's products or services. Marketing teams with a strong sense of marketing ethics, for example, may commit to such practices as protecting user data through encryption, avoiding marketing techniques that are considere",

As generative AI changes content operations, online publishers face new decisions. Not only do they need to decide how and when to use AI to support the development of content.\u00a0They must also decide how to communicate that decision to their customers. How can organizations using AI to develop their content also ensure they are creating a good experience for content users? Why disclosing AI use matters Generative AI is already being used widely in enterprises by employees and small teams, often without the knowledge of executives or content leadership. A recent article in Business Insider discussed \u201cthe hidden wave of employees using AI on the sly,\u201d what is known as \u201cshadow IT.\u201d Generative AI is also becoming embedded within content development tools.\u00a0Google\u2019s Duet, for example, allows content creators to use generative AI capabilities within Google Office applications. Similar functionality is appearing in many enterprise applications. In many respects, it\u2019s encouraging to see employees embrace new technology instead of hesitating to change their work routines. But ungoverned use of generative AI carries a host of risks. Given that the use of generative AI is already becoming the norm in many organizations, organizations need policies and processes governing its use, especially around disclosing that use. Disclosing AI use enhances the value of the content.\u00a0It can improve its internal governance as well as its acceptance by readers. It gives visibility to your organization\u2019s values relating to AI use. Transparency for customers Recent research on the user acceptance of AI notes: \u201cTransparency plays an important indirect role in regulating trust and the perception of performance.\u201d Employees may be keen to use AI, but not all customers are so sure.

How Can I Meet These as a Creator? Staying informed on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) guidelines is a must if you\u2019re a creator. While these guidelines can often be confusing, staying informed on them is a must when it comes to recommending or endorsing products on behalf of brands. These are more than rules. They are the foundation of maintaining transparency and trust with your audience. And these can change as the space evolves, making it hard to keep up.\u00a0 But don\u2019t worry, this guide will break down the FTC guidelines creators need to know. We\u2019ll also cover how to put these into action in your next branded post to keep your content compliant and ethical. Why Do FTC Guidelines Matter? The FTC guidelines protect consumers from misleading advertising. As a creator, your endorsements are powerful and as you may know, influential.\u00a0 When a relationship with a brand is not disclosed, it can mislead your followers and affect their purchasing decisions. Following these guidelines prevents legal repercussions and builds trust with your audience. Adhering to the FTC guidelines is non-negotiable in the world of influencer marketing. Honest and consistent disclosures will help build a loyal and trusting audience. Remember, your credibility is everything.\u00a0 Looking to tap into brand collabs?

They have been included in each of the three major AI regulations to date, and now new draft rules and standards specifically focus on labeling.\u00a0 Explicit Labeling The draft rules provide more specific guidance for where and how the explicit, human-perceivable labels can be applied for various types of generated content. The key is giving the user notice of the images\u2019 origins, and labels in other types of media content should consider the traits of that media to determine what placement will make the label notice most effective.\u00a0\u00a0 Interestingly, users can request copies of AI-generated content without labeling. Service providers may provide this after taking steps to ensure that the users understand the labeling requirements. Implicit Labeling is described as embedding production information to the meta-data, including the AI content generation service providers\u2019 name or code, the content reference number, and file attribute information. Service providers are also encouraged to use methods such as digital watermarks covertly placed within AI content, as an additional label.\u00a0 NOTE: Specific examples of both Explicit and Implicit Labeling are provided in the draft technical standards. Content Review Labeling The draft measures add an additional level of labeling, requiring service providers who provide content transmission functions to review content and add lables according to three situations. This involves reviewing content for existing implicit labels, user assertions, and other evidence that the content is machine-generated. \u00a0Responsibilities Liability As is common in normative documents like this one, the punishments for non-compliance are only alluded to with reference to other laws and regulations.

Log In Sign Up Home Opinion Artificial Intelligence The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling of AI-Generated Media by Alex Cooke December 27, 2024 16 Comments Facebook X 16 Comments In the digital age, information flows at speeds and scales that are unprecedented in human history. Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency.

Download Quick Read CNTI\u2019s Summary Deepfakes, a form of synthetic media content that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to create realistic depictions of people and events, have proliferated in recent years. There are many questions about how this content affects journalists, fact-based news and mis- and disinformation. In addressing these concerns it is important to consider freedom of expression and safety. Relatedly, policies targeting deepfakes must be clear about what types of content qualify as such. Detection technologies and provenance approaches are being rapidly developed but it is unlikely they can prevent all potential harms by AI-altered content. Additional research should consider (1) what effects deepfakes have on journalism, (2) how content labeling addresses concerns about deepfakes (and what types are most effective), (3) what international standards should be applied to content to confirm its authenticity and (4) how best to teach the public to identify synthetic media.

Log In Sign Up Home Opinion Artificial Intelligence The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling of AI-Generated Media by Alex Cooke December 27, 2024 16 Comments Facebook X 16 Comments In the digital age, information flows at speeds and scales that are unprecedented in human history. Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency.

Abstract Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large volume of academic work suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce people\u2019s belief in and sharing of content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: (1) communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools) versus (2) diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). Next, we summarize results from two large-scale experiments demonstrating that labeling can, under certain conditions, meaningfully decrease individuals\u2019 likelihood of believing and engaging with misleading, AI-generated images.

The notion of authenticity (i.e., the accuracy, reliability, and trustworthiness of content) becomes particularly fraught in the context of content made using generative AI (GenAI) tools [1] such as DALL-E, ChatGPT, or Adobe Firefly. Providing transparency means presenting viewers with clear and understandable information about how content was created, and disclosing the role of AI in that process, if any. Transparency is essential for fostering viewer trust and understanding, as well as for ensuring accountability and support for responsible AI development and deployment. Insights \u2192 AI labeling can be a valuable tool in the fight against mis- and disinformation, helping viewers understand the potential for biases or manipulations. \u2192 Creators wish to demonstrate their creative process, while viewers seek information to inform authenticity perceptions. \u2192 We need participation in industrywide collaborations, adherence to legislative measures, and the integration of provenance information at both the creation and display stages of AI-generated content. Many researchers have explored AI-labeling solutions to support this type of transparency for viewers, which involves providing metadata, tags, or annotations to content produced by AI models [2,3,4]. Such studies have shown that surfacing GenAI labels to consumers with text or graphics displayed on or next to content can be a valuable tool in the fight against mis- and disinformation, helping viewers understand the potential for biases or manipulations in the content they are consuming. For example, Chloe Wittenberg et al. [4] propose a framework for labeling AI-generated media according to the goal that specific labels are intending to accomplish. The authors propose either pro",

These changes are also informed by Meta\u2019s policy review process that included extensive public opinion surveys and consultations with academics, civil society organizations and others. We agree with the Oversight Board\u2019s argument that our existing approach is too narrow since it only covers videos that are created or altered by AI to make a person appear to say something they didn\u2019t say. Our manipulated media policy was written in 2020 when realistic AI-generated content was rare and the overarching concern was about videos. In the last four years, and particularly in the last year, people have developed other kinds of realistic AI-generated content like audio and photos, and this technology is quickly evolving. As the Board noted, it\u2019s equally important to address manipulation that shows a person doing something they didn\u2019t do. The Board also argued that we unnecessarily risk restricting freedom of expression when we remove manipulated media that does not otherwise violate our Community Standards. It recommended a \u201cless restrictive\u201d approach to manipulated media like labels with context. In February, we announced that we\u2019ve been working with industry partners on common technical standards for identifying AI content, including video and audio. Our \u201cMade with AI\u201d labels on AI-generated video, audio and images will be based on our detection of industry-shared signals of AI images or people self-disclosing that they\u2019re uploading AI-generated content.

I\u2019ve already talked at some length about the environmental, economic, and labor issues involved, as well as discrimination and social bias. But this time I want to dig in a little and focus on some psychological and social impacts from the AI generated media and content we consume, specifically on our relationship to critical thinking, learning, and conceptualizing knowledge. History Hoaxes have been perpetrated using photography essentially since its invention. The moment we started having a form of media that was believed to show us true, unmediated reality of phenomena and events, was the moment that people started coming up with ways to manipulate that form of media, to great artistic and philosophical effect. (As well as humorous or simply fraudulent effect.) We have a form of unwarranted trust in photographs, despite this, and we have developed a relationship with the form that balances between trust and skepticism. When I was a child, the internet was not yet broadly available to the general public, and certainly very few homes had access to it, but by the time I was a teenager that had completely changed, and everyone I knew spent time on AOL instant messenger. Around the time I left graduate school, the iPhone was launched and the smartphone era started.

The difficulty of moving from a generic discussion about AI regulation to its actual implementation was illustrated by what happened next: Expanding upon his European comments, Mr. Altman explained, \u201cThe details really matter.\u201d Those \u201cdetails\u201d surface three challenges for AI oversight: dealing with the velocity of AI developments, parsing the components of what to regulate, and determining who regulates and how. CHALLENGE #1: VELOCITY (aka THE RED QUEEN PROBLEM) In Lewis Carroll\u2019s 1871 surrealistic classic Through the Looking Glass, the Red Queen tells Alice: \u201cNow here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run twice as fast as that!\u201d It is an appropriate admonition for oversight in fast-paced AI era. Artificial intelligence has been quietly evolving behind the scenes for some time. When Google auto-completes a search query, or Amazon recommends a book, AI is at work. In November 2022, however, the release of ChatGPT-3 moved AI out of the shadows, repositioning it from a tool for software engineers, to a tool that is consumer-focused and ordinary people can use themselves without any need for technical expertise.

Our experts identify actionable best practices and incentives for industry and government leaders on artificial intelligence, cyber threats, cloud security, countering influence operations, reducing the risk of biotechnologies, and ensuring global digital inclusion. In 2017, spurred by advocacy from civil society groups, the New York City Council created a task force to address the city\u2019s growing use of artificial intelligence. But the task force quickly ran aground attempting to come to a consensus on the scope of \u201cautomated decision systems.\u201d In one hearing, a city agency argued that the task force\u2019s definition was so expansive that it might include simple calculations such as formulas in spreadsheets. By the end of its eighteen-month term, the task force\u2019s ambitions had narrowed from addressing how the city uses automated decision systems to simply defining the types of systems that should be subject to oversight. New York City isn\u2019t alone in this struggle.

And while governments scramble to develop regulations to make AI safer, more secure, and trustworthy, leaders of technology behemoths, including Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai, Microsoft president Brad Smith, and OpenAI, then Microsoft, then OpenAI CEO again Sam Altman, are throwing their support behind AI regulation \u2014 traditionally one of the most significant headwinds and headaches for new technology. So why would tech leaders be in support of regulation? At its core, a set of well-thought-out rules would ensure that AI firms invest in products they know won\u2019t be regulated out of existence. Cooperation from the tech world would also mean that companies would have a cohesive set of rules rather than a patchwork of disparate AI laws across various states, allowing them to weigh in on creating the regulations. According to Darrell West, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute\u2019s Center for Technology Innovation, \u201cThe worst-case scenario for businesses is having 50 different sets of rules at the state level. It would be expensive to devise different software for Idaho as opposed to Illinois.\u201d Put another way, a known regulatory landscape is invariably easier to navigate than an environment of \u201cknown unknowns.\u201d The proliferation of AI governance efforts this year at nearly every level has been a natural extension of the fast deployment of AI and industry reorientation around it.

Still, it sets a significant policy agenda as other bodies\u2014including Congress and aligned international partners\u2014consider the next steps.

Choosing a Regulatory Definition of AI One common approach is to adopt the definition that is used in a regulation or in official government guidance that applies to the company\u2019s use of AI, such as the Biden Executive Order, which defines \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d or \u201cAI\u201d as \u201ca machine-based system that can, for a given set of human-defined objectives, make predictions, recommendations, or decisions influencing real or virtual environments.\u201d The advantage of this approach is that it usually insulates the company from regulatory scrutiny over the choice of wording for their AI definition. But official definitions of AI are often the result of agency compromises, which can lead to ambiguities. For example, it is not entirely clear if complex algorithms that make predictions about who is likely to repay a loan, but do not utilize machine learning, would be covered by the above definition. Risks of Using Ambiguous Regulatory AI Definitions Uncertainties as to what is covered by a particular definition of AI may benefit regulators who wish to maintain flexibility as to the scope of certain obligations, but they can create significant compliance problems for companies trying to set out clear rules for responsible AI use in their organizations. If an ambiguous definition of AI is interpreted too narrowly, such that algorithms that do not use machine learning are scoped out, some higher-risk models that ",

These changes are also informed by Meta\u2019s policy review process that included extensive public opinion surveys and consultations with academics, civil society organizations and others. We agree with the Oversight Board\u2019s argument that our existing approach is too narrow since it only covers videos that are created or altered by AI to make a person appear to say something they didn\u2019t say. Our manipulated media policy was written in 2020 when realistic AI-generated content was rare and the overarching concern was about videos. In the last four years, and particularly in the last year, people have developed other kinds of realistic AI-generated content like audio and photos, and this technology is quickly evolving. As the Board noted, it\u2019s equally important to address manipulation that shows a person doing something they didn\u2019t do. The Board also argued that we unnecessarily risk restricting freedom of expression when we remove manipulated media that does not otherwise violate our Community Standards. It recommended a \u201cless restrictive\u201d approach to manipulated media like labels with context. In February, we announced that we\u2019ve been working with industry partners on common technical standards for identifying AI content, including video and audio.

There are alarming implications of synthetic media for everything from the integrity of elections to celebrity nudes. Examples of harms documented to date include scammers using fake audio to steal money by posing as family members in crisis, videos created of politicians seeming to say things that are completely fabricated, and photos of people being sexualized into nude images and video that are then used for the purposes of sextortion or other forms of harassment. Beyond individual pieces of fabricated content, generative AI is being used to create deepfake websites, thereby making it easier to create and distribute additional false content at scale. These harms are just some examples of a complex problem that will require a whole of society approach, including government regulation, industry self-regulation, public and private technological advances, and education. It is impossible to entirely mitigate the threats of synthetic media, but certain strategies may reduce the problem substantially. Incorporating markers into AI-generated content As a first step to addressing these issues, many experts highlight the importance of being able to distinguish between AI-generated, AI-altered, and human generated content. This is critical for identifying content ownership for the purposes of understanding IP rights, creating accountability and responsibility for content safety with the original content owner, and for the purposes of prioritizing investigations of real-world harm (e.g. rescue of real children in videos or images showing abuse vs. wasting resources investigating fabricate",

Had the Pentagon image contained signs that it was AI-generated, technology platforms might have been able to take action more quickly; they could have promptly reduced its distribution or perhaps labeled the content so that audiences might have been able to more easily identify it as fake. Confusion, and by extension market movement, might have been avoided.\u00a0\u00a0 There\u2019s no question that we need more transparency if we\u2019re going to be able to differentiate between what is real and what is synthetic. Last month, the White House weighed in on how to do this, announcing that seven of the most prominent AI companies have committed to \u201cdevelop robust technical measures to ensure that users know when content is AI-generated, such as watermarking.\u201d\u00a0 Disclosure methods like watermarks are a good start.

This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). Summary As the influence of transformer-based approaches in general and generative artificial intelligence (AI) in particular continues to expand across various domains, concerns regarding authenticity and explainability are on the rise. Here, we share our perspective on the necessity of implementing effective detection, verification, and explainability mechanisms to counteract the potential harms arising from the proliferation of AI-generated inauthentic content and science. We recognize the transformative potential of generative AI, exemplified by ChatGPT, in the scientific landscape. However, we also emphasize the urgency of addressing associated challenges, particularly in light of the risks posed by disinformation, misinformation, and unreproducible science. This perspective serves as a response to the call for concerted efforts to safeguard the authenticity of information in the age of AI. By prioritizing detection, fact-checking, and explainability policies, we aim to foster a climate of trust, uphold ethical standards, and harness the full potential of AI for the betterment of science and society.

However, with this innovation comes the challenge of distinguishing AI-generated content from human-made material. This creates another issue media companies must grapple with to build and maintain audience trust. Mozilla\u2019s latest report, In Transparency We Trust?, delves into the transformative impact of AI-generated content and its challenges.

The report also raises concerns about AI-generated content and social media\u2019s powerful reach \u2015 intensifying the spread of algorithmic preferences and emotionally charged material. Where generative AI falls on the synthetic content spectrum AI-generated content is a subset of synthetic content. It includes images, videos, sounds, or any other form generated, edited, or enabled by artificial intelligence. Synthetic content exists on a spectrum with varying degrees of artificiality. One end of the spectrum features raw content, comprising hand-drawn illustrations, unaltered photographs, and human-written texts. These elements are untouched, representing the most natural form of creative expression. Moving along the spectrum is minimally edited content. Subtle refinements characterize this stage, like using Grammarly for text refinement or adjusting image contrast with photo editing apps. These adjustments enhance the quality and clarity of the content while maintaining its original essence. Stepping up from minimally processed content is ultra-processed, where automated methods and software play a more significant role in altering or enhancing human-generated material.

Pros and cons of AI-generated content Artificial intelligence is growing rapidly in the tech sector and assisting with various tasks such as creating images and generating content. However, it cannot do everything. AI-generated content is becoming popular, but many people wonder how to use it and if it truly sounds authentic. AI is growing rapidly in the tech sector, including supply chain, food industry, chatbot, and content and image generation use cases. AI-generated images made the news when critics claimed that these AI art systems are stealing people's intellectual property on large models, such OpenAI's Dall-E. And people are wondering if AI will take the place of artists and illustrators. OpenAI introduced a similar AI program for content known as ChatGPT. This bot serves a more general purpose and offers an open prompt for users to ask questions, give a command or ask for an observation. The bot answers both broad and specific questions. The system generated answers that professors and other educators said were extensive enough to receive a good grade. However, after further review, some sources -- such as Stack Overflow for coders and developers -- said the information was incorrect and temporarily banned answers using this system.

The adoption of AI for content creation, data analysis, decision-making and other labor-intensive jobs is growing at a rapid rate, prompting many to question its social impacts. Will these changes benefit some more than others? Will they advantage or disadvantage students? Can they lead innovation themselves or are they limited to their input? UC Davis experts Martin Hilbert and Marit MacArthur from the UC Davis College of Letters and Science answer these and other important questions at a recent Team Research Forum. Role of AI in education and research In the AI-skeptical piece titled \u201cOn the dangers of stochastic parrots: Can language models be too big?\u201d Bender et al. make the point \u201cthat most language technology is built to serve the needs of those who already have the most privileges in society.\u201d At this point, researchers posit that AI-enabled tools such as ChatGPT are designed to serve experts, not novices, which begs the question of the social impact of AI in education. Critical editing holds the key According to MacArthur, general purpose AI tools have been designed for experts and well-educated workers to build more expertise and to increase efficiency. They are not designed for novices or education where training students to develop expertise by challenging and guiding them is the core focus. A Temple University study shows that \u201cthe usage of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT or GitHub Copilot, poses a unique problem, as they were not developed solely for an educational purpose and their inclusion in the classroom may have unknown effects. Many researchers have begun to explore the potential negative effects the inclusion of these models into education may bring, including bias and fairness of these models, over-reliance, explainability, and trust.\u201d MacArthur ad",

In contrast, the US so far has been taking a more decentralized approach, allowing states to draft their own regulations. International organizations are collaborating to develop multilateral AI governance frameworks. The UN Resolution A/78/L.49 emphasizes the importance of ethical AI principles and adherence to international human rights law. Private sector companies must prioritize data privacy, transparency, and legal liability in AI development and deployment. AI regulatory compliance is crucial for ensuring the responsible and sustainable use of AI technologies. Compliance will differ across continents, and we\u2019re likely",

Public policies (laws, regulations, rules, executive orders) are made through a complex process that involves lawmakers, advocates, lobbyists, community action and data. The policies they create and amend ends up having real impact on real people. Policy shapers use a variety of tools to make decisions about the policy they create, and with the growth of artificial intelligence technology across industries, policy shapers may be considering if they should use it as well. Here are some reasons why they should be curious about AI in improving their policymaking process. Why Does Transparency in the Legislative Process Matter? You may agree that laws should be created with the interest and support of the communities that are impacted. In a true democracy, every citizen\u2019s voice is to be heard and considered in policymaking. Pluralism, in political philosophy and theory, prioritizes making room for diverse points of view in making decisions for society; it values power-sharing. Today, rather than seeing diverse and dynamic conversation about policy, we are seeing critical issues reduced down into one of only two extreme buckets of thought and consideration. What would fix that? We need a plurality of voices to be included in the creation of policy and laws. How Can AI Improve Transparency in Policymaking? The opportunity exists for the legislative process to become more responsive and inclusive. The technology of artificial intelligence can be applied in any context; what it does is perform tasks in smart and efficient ways by learning from models that it\u2019s given. The more data it is given to learn from, the smarter the technology gets at understanding the data and answering questions. The information that the system is learning can then be given back to us policy shapers and changemake",

Berinsky Mitsui Professor of Political Science Department of Political Science David G. Rand Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences MIT Sloan School of Management Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences For correspondence: drand@mit.edu 1 Executive Summary \u25cf Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). \u25cf Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large academic literature suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce belief in, and sharing of, content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. \u25cf In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. \u25cf First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: \u25cb Communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools). \u25cb Diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). \u25cf We then highlight several important issues and chall",

Following this move, marketers may face new challenges in maintaining authority and trust on the platform, leaving brands to reconsider the use of AI-generated content and prioritize messaging crafted by humans, for humans. While this should help improve transparency, the shift is reshaping content marketing strategies and forcing marketers to take new considerations into account. Below, members of Forbes Agency Council explore different ways this change could impact marketing on LinkedIn and offer practical advice to help marketers adapt their approaches and stay ahead of the curve. 1. AI Will Provide Ideas And Inspiration This is an excellent move by LinkedIn to bring more transparency to the platform. AI should always be used for ideas and inspiration, but not as the final source of content generation. This should inspire marketers to find a direction and plan and write content that resonates with their audience. - Daksh Sharma, Iffort 2. Authenticity Will Be Emphasized Marketers who do the work should appreciate that authenticity matters. If we use AI to do all the work, then we aren\u2019t doing our jobs right. My team uses AI for efficiency, but we don\u2019t use it to replace our brains. We recognize that allowing AI to create content will lead to platforms that do not have real people on them. A premium focus on authenticity is the right approach. It\u2019s a good thing. - Monica Alvarez-Mitchell, Pulse Creative, LLC 3. Lines Will Need To Be Drawn Humanity will benefit when AI- and non-AI-produced content is marked on social networks.

In this post, we break down the four biggest benefits of AI-powered drug labeling. New players in the pharmaceutical industry are scaling their AI capabilities fast and creating significant value. However, the applications of AI are diverse and these companies need to determine where and how AI-powered tools can most add value for them. One area where AI-powered tools have the potential to make a significant, tangible impact is drug labeling. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore the top four benefits of AI-powered drug labeling and how these benefits combat industry challenges. 4 Biggest Benefits AI Brings to Drug Labeling #1 \u2013 AI Ensures Sustained Quality & Compliance One of the biggest challenges in the pharmaceutical label authoring space is ensuring quality and compliance. Since most existing systems and processes cannot easily transform Core Data Sheets (CCDS) to local label formats (USPI, SmPC, etc.), the quality of submission is at risk from manual errors (i.e., incorrectly copying and pasting) and delays. Further, current processes make it difficult for labeling teams and regulatory affairs professionals alike to understand how and why a label was rendered over time; pharmaceutical companies must engage in time-consuming back-and-forth with regulators to identify and validate specific changes within a given label. Similarly, when a label update is required, labeling teams must determine if there are other documents that need to be reviewed and subsequently updated. In the absence of automated change management and branching, identifying all the right documents to update can be difficult. Introducing AI-powered, life sciences-trained tools into the drug labeling process can increase quality and compliance while reducing the time and complexity of curre",

AI-generated content refers to written material produced by artificial intelligence systems, primarily using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies. The concept has its roots dating back to the 1950s when early language models were developed. However, it wasn\u2019t until the 2010s that AI writing capabilities significantly advanced thanks to the rise of large language models like GPT-3 trained on vast datasets from the internet. In 2020, the AI company Anthropic released an AI model called Claude that could generate long-form content like articles and stories. Major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic have continued pouring resources into refining AI language models. This has led to AI writing tools like Addlly AI and Jasper AI hitting the market, allowing businesses and individuals to generate marketing copy, emails, essays and more via AI. While still an emerging field with limitations, AI-generated content is becoming increasingly prevalent and sophisticated each year. The technology promises increased productivity but has also raised concerns around originality and potential misuse. Pros of AI-Generated Content AI-generated content offer",

Abstract Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large volume of academic work suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce people\u2019s belief in and sharing of content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: (1) communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools) versus (2) diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). Next, we summarize results from two large-scale experiments demonstrating that labeling can, under certain conditions, meaningfully decrease individuals\u2019 likelihood of believing and engaging with misleading, AI-generated images. Finally, we highlight several important issues and challenges that must be considered wh",

One of the drawbacks of the adoption of this technology, however, is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate human-generated content from synthetic content generated by AI, potentially enabling illegal and harmful conduct. Policymakers around the globe are therefore pondering how to design and implement watermarking techniques to ensure a trustworthy AI environment. China has already taken steps to ban AI-generated images without watermarks. The US administration has been tasked with developing effective labelling and content provenance mechanisms so that end users are able to determine when content is generated using AI and when it is not. The G7 has asked companies to develop and deploy reliable content authentication and provenance mechanisms, such as watermarking, to enable users to identify AI-generated content. The EU's new AI act, provisionally agreed in December 2023, places a number of obligations on providers and users of AI systems to enable the detection and tracing of AI-generated content. Implementation of these obligations will likely require use of watermarking techniques. Current state-of-the-art AI watermarking techniques display strong technical limitations and drawbacks, however, in terms of technical implementation, accuracy and robustness. Generative AI developers and policymakers now face a number of issues, including how to ensure the development of robust watermarking tools and how to foster watermarking standardisation and implementation rules.

Berinsky Mitsui Professor of Political Science Department of Political Science David G. Rand Professor of Management Science and Brain and Cognitive Sciences MIT Sloan School of Management Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences For correspondence: drand@mit.edu 1 Executive Summary \u25cf Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). \u25cf Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large academic literature suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce belief in, and sharing of, content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. \u25cf In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. \u25cf First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: \u25cb Communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools). \u25cb Diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). \u25cf We then highlight several important issues and chall",

Our intent has always been to help people know when they see content that was made with AI, and we\u2019ve continued to work with companies across the industry to improve our labeling process so that labels on our platforms are more in line with peoples\u2019 expectations. For content that we detect was only modified or edited by AI tools, we are moving the \u201cAI info\u201d label to the post\u2019s menu. We will still display the \u201cAI info\u201d label for content we detect was generated by an AI tool and share whether the content is labeled because of industry-shared signals or because someone self-disclosed. These changes will begin next week. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Update on July 1, 2024 at 7:00AM PT:\u00a0 We want people to know when they see posts that have been made with AI. Earlier this year, we announced a new approach for labeling AI-generated content. An important part of this approach relies on industry standard indicators that other companies include in content created using their tools, which help us assess whether something is created using AI. Like others across the industry, we\u2019ve found that our labels based on these indicators weren\u2019t always aligned with people\u2019s expectations and didn\u2019t always provide enough context. For example, some content that included minor modifications using AI, such as retouching tools, included industry standard indicators that were then labeled \u201cMade with AI.\u201d While we work with companies across the industry to improve the process so our labeling approach better matches our intent, we\u2019re updating the \u201cMade with AI\u201d label to \u201cAI info\u201d across our apps, which people can click for more information.

There is an ongoing debate on how and when to label and disclose AI content within SEO. The recent executive order by President Joe Biden, focusing on AI security and safety, has brought renewed attention to the topic. This order, mandating standards for labeling AI-generated content, aims to help verify the authenticity of communications, particularly those appearing to be from the government. A key concern driving this initiative is the potential for AI-generated content to spread false information. But it also highlights the questions of what AI content is, and when it makes sense to label it from an SEO perspective. This task is made more complex by a recent study co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand, which sheds light on public perception and understanding of various terms associated with AI content (from \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI generated\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI manipulated\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The study shows that there is not a single term that can cover content produced by/with AI and that there broad cultural difference in the understanding of AI content and the related terms association. I think David Rand's following quote is quite good: Let's start with an example of why this is an essential question for SEOs by looking at some of the backlashes several news sites have experienced when trying to fake real authors when publishing pure AI content. The Sports Illustrated Case: A Spotlight on AI Labeling The recent case involving Sports Illustrated serves as a prime example of how AI labeling has garnered attention. The renowned sports publication found itself in the midst of controversy when it was discovered that certain articles were published under fictitious author names, complete with AI-generated headshots. This revelation was brought to light by Futurism, a news outlet that reported these nonexistent authors' headshots were available for purchase on a website that special",

Generative AI systems are capable of generating new forms of data by applying machine learning to large quantities of training data. This new data can include text (such as Google\u2019s Bard, Meta\u2019s LLaMa, or OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT), visuals (such as Stable Diffusion or OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E), or audio (such as Microsoft\u2019s VALL-E). The output that can be produced with these systems at great speed and ease for a majority of users is, depending on the instructions, sufficiently sophisticated that humans can perceive it as indistinguishable from human-generated content (Groh et al., 2022).

AI programs, especially Large Language Models (LLMs), which train to write fluent-reading text using vast data sets, have automated many aspects of fake news generation.\u00a0The new instant video generator Sora, which produces highly detailed, Hollywood-quality clips, further raises concerns about the easy spread of fake footage.

This study examines the prevalence and characteristics of synthetic media on social media platform X from December 2022 to September 2023. Leveraging crowdsourced annotations identifying synthetic content, our analysis reveals an increase in AI-generated media over time, with an initial spike in March 2023, following the release of Midjourney V5. While most synthetic media identified is non-political and non-malicious, concerning deepfakes targeting political figures persist, raising questions on the potential for misuse of AI technologies.

The phenomenon of fake news and misinformation has had significant impacts across various sectors, including the world of finance and politics. A notable example occurred in mid-January 2023, when the spread of a false report stating that the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) had approved a spot-listed ETF (exchange-traded fund) caused volatility in Bitcoin prices [1]. In May 2023, an instance of generative AI being used to create a fictitious image of a building near the Pentagon in Washington D.C. engulfed in black flames, leading to turmoil in the U.S. stock market [2].

Present and future concerns Generative AI is revolutionizing content creation across digital platforms, offering tools that automate and enhance the production of text, images, and videos. This technology not only streamlines workflows but also personalizes user experiences through sophisticated algorithms. However, as generative AI continues to evolve, it raises significant concerns regarding the authenticity of content and the potential spread of misinformation. The challenge lies in developing and implementing effective detection methods to distinguish between human and AI-generated content, ensuring integrity and trust in digital media as we move forward. How AI impacts on social media Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly shapes social media by streamlining content creation and management, which enhances user engagement and personalizes experiences. However, it also introduces challenges such as the proliferation of fake news, deepfakes, and sophisticated misinformation, making it difficult for users to distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. This downside can appear because of creators who fail to verify the veracity of content, but also ill-intentioned users who benefit from these tools for their wrong-doings. While AI detectors aim to address these issues, they often struggle to keep pace with the evolving capabilities of AI, resulting in frequent inaccuracies. In this discussion, we will explore more effective solutions for identifying AI-generated content, thereby enhancing the safety and reliability of social media platforms. This is crucial for understanding how AI is being used on social media and for developing strategies to mitigate its risks.

The synthetic images that emerged were\u00a0often crude,\u00a0unconvincing\u00a0and costly to produce, especially when other kinds of misinformation were so inexpensive and easy to spread on social media. The threat posed by AI and so-called\u00a0deepfakes\u00a0always seemed a year or two away. No more. Sophisticated generative AI tools can now create\u00a0cloned human voices\u00a0and\u00a0hyper-realistic images, videos and audio in seconds, at minimal cost. When strapped to powerful social media algorithms, this fake and digitally created content can spread far and fast and target highly specific audiences, potentially taking campaign dirty tricks to a new low. The implications for the 2024 campaigns and elections are as large as they are troubling: Generative AI can not only rapidly produce targeted campaign emails, texts or videos, it also could be used to\u00a0mislead voters, impersonate candidates and undermine elections on a scale and at a speed not yet seen. WATCH: Security expert warns of AI tools\u2019 potential threat to democracy \u201cWe\u2019re not prepared for this,\u201d warned A.J. Nash, vice president of intelligence at the cybersecurity firm ZeroFox. \u201dTo me, the big leap forward is the audio and video capabilities that have emerged. When you can do that on a large scale, and distribute it on social platforms, well, it\u2019s going to have a major impact.\u201d AI experts\u00a0can quickly rattle off a number of alarming scenarios in which generative AI is used to create synthetic media for the purposes of confusing voters, slandering a candidate or even inciting violence.

Political Misinformation Is Not an AI Problem. Technology isn\u2019t the problem\u2014or the solution. By Sayash Kapoor & Arvind Narayanan December 13, 2024 AI-generated misinformation was one of the top concerns during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In January 2024, the World Economic Forum\u00a0claimed that \u201cmisinformation and disinformation is the most severe short-term risk the world faces\u201d and that \u201cAI is amplifying manipulated and distorted information that could destabilize societies.\u201d News headlines about elections in 2024 tell a similar story: In contrast, in our past writing, we predicted that AI would not lead to a misinformation apocalypse. When Meta released its open-weight large language model (called LLaMA), we argued that it would not lead to a tidal wave of misinformation. And in a follow-up essay, we pointed out that the distributionof misinformation is the key bottleneck for influence operations, and while generative AI reduces the cost of creating misinformation, it does not reduce the cost of distributing it. A few other researchers have made similar arguments. Which of these two perspectives better fits the facts? Fortunately, we have the evidence of AI use in elections that took place around the globe in 2024 to help answer this question. Many news outlets and research projects have compiled known instances of AI-generated text and media and their impact. Instead of speculating about AI\u2019s potential, we can look at its real-world impact to date. We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections",

These include imitating the voices of real people and creating photos and videos that are indistinguishable from real ones. But there is also a positive side. Used smartly, GAI can provide a greater number of content consumers with trustworthy information, thereby counteracting disinformation.

Some of the posts on X (formerly Twitter) showing the image received millions of views. It prompted emotional responses from many users - including many Republicans eager to criticize the Biden administration\u2019s disaster response. But others quickly pointed out telltale signs that the image was likely made with generative artificial intelligence tools, such as malformed limbs and blurriness common to some AI image generators. Untangling Disinformation How AI-generated memes are changing the 2024 election This election cycle, such AI-generated synthetic images have proliferated on social media platforms, often after politically charged news events. People watching online platforms and the election closely say that these images are a way to spread partisan narratives with facts often being irrelevant. After X users added a community note flagging that the image of the child in the boat was likely AI-generated, some who shared the image, like Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), deleted their posts about it, according to Rolling Stone. But even after the image\u2019s synthetic provenance was revealed, others doubled down. \"I don\u2019t know where this photo came from and honestly, it doesn\u2019t matter.\" wrote Amy Kremer, a Republican National Committee member representing Georgia, on X.

Waldron, Yaron Dori, Jennifer Johnson, Corey Walker, Jorge Ortiz & John Bowers on July 31, 2024 Posted in Artificial Intelligence (AI) On Thursday, July 25, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) released a\u00a0Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM)\u00a0proposing new requirements for radio and television broadcasters and certain other licensees that air political ads containing content created using artificial intelligence (AI).\u00a0 The NPRM was approved on a 3-2 party-line vote and comes in the wake of an announcement made by FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel earlier this summer about the need for such requirements, which we discussed\u00a0here. At the core of the NPRM are two proposed requirements.\u00a0 First, parties subject to the rules would have to announce on-air that a political ad (whether a candidate-sponsored ad or an \u201cissue ad\u201d purchased by a political action committee) was created using AI.\u00a0 Second, those parties would have to include a note in their online political files for political ads containing AI-generated content disclosing the use of such content.\u00a0 Additional key features of the NPRM are described below.

These changes are also informed by Meta\u2019s policy review process that included extensive public opinion surveys and consultations with academics, civil society organizations and others. We agree with the Oversight Board\u2019s argument that our existing approach is too narrow since it only covers videos that are created or altered by AI to make a person appear to say something they didn\u2019t say. Our manipulated media policy was written in 2020 when realistic AI-generated content was rare and the overarching concern was about videos. In the last four years, and particularly in the last year, people have developed other kinds of realistic AI-generated content like audio and photos, and this technology is quickly evolving. As the Board noted, it\u2019s equally important to address manipulation that shows a person doing something they didn\u2019t do. The Board also argued that we unnecessarily risk restricting freedom of expression when we remove manipulated media that does not otherwise violate our Community Standards. It recommended a \u201cless restrictive\u201d approach to manipulated media like labels with context. In February, we announced that we\u2019ve been working with industry partners on common technical standards for identifying AI content, including video and audio.

AI-generated content is proliferating online, and social media companies have started to label it. Sacha Altay and Fabrizio Gilardi conducted two preregistered online experiments among 4,976 US and UK participants to investigate the effect of labeling headlines as AI. The study is published in the journal PNAS Nexus. Respondents rated 16 headlines that were either true, false, AI- or human-generated. In Study 1, participants were randomly assigned to conditions in which (i) no headline was labeled as AI, (ii) AI-generated headlines were labeled as AI, (iii) human-generated headlines were labeled as AI, and (iv) false headlines were labeled as false. The results show that respondents rated headlines labeled as AI-generated as less accurate and were less willing to share them, regardless of whether the headlines were true or false, and regardless of whether the headlines were created by humans or AI. The effect of labeling headlines as AI-generated was three times smaller than labeling headlines as false. The authors also investigated the mechanisms behind this AI aversion by experimentally manipulating definitions of AI-generated headlines. The authors found that AI aversion is due to expectations that headlines labeled as AI-generated have been entirely written by AI with no human supervision. Despite wide support for the labeling of AI-generated content, the authors argue that transparency regarding the meaning of the labels is needed as the labels may have negative unintended consequences.",

Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency. The consequences of failing to regulate and label AI-generated media can be dramatic. Consider how misleading content might alter electoral outcomes, stoke social conflicts, damage reputations, or lead to fraudulent activities. These risks are not hypothetical; examples have already surfaced globally, with high-profile incidents where political leaders were impersonated or where \u201cevidence\u201d of events that never occurred went viral.

They have been included in each of the three major AI regulations to date, and now new draft rules and standards specifically focus on labeling.\u00a0 Explicit Labeling The draft rules provide more specific guidance for where and how the explicit, human-perceivable labels can be applied for various types of generated content. The key is giving the user notice of the images\u2019 origins, and labels in other types of media content should consider the traits of that media to determine what placement will make the label notice most effective.\u00a0\u00a0 Interestingly, users can request copies of AI-generated content without labeling. Service providers may provide this after taking steps to ensure that the users understand the labeling requirements. Implicit Labeling is described as embedding production information to the meta-data, including the AI content generation service providers\u2019 name or code, the content reference number, and file attribute information. Service providers are also encouraged to use methods such as digital watermarks covertly placed within AI content, as an additional label.\u00a0 NOTE: Specific examples of both Explicit and Implicit Labeling are provided in the draft technical standards. Content Review Labeling The draft measures add an additional level of labeling, requiring service providers who provide content transmission functions to review content and add lables according to three situations. This involves reviewing content for existing implicit labels, user assertions, and other evidence that the content is machine-generated. \u00a0Responsibilities Liability As is common in normative documents like this one, the punishments for non-compliance are only alluded to with reference to other laws and regulations.

Your efforts in vetting sources can significantly reduce the risk of inaccuracies or fabricated information. The Rise of AI in Content Creation AI gives brands the capability to create content at an incredibly rapid rate. This increased accessibility introduces new challenges with accuracy. The Speed vs. Accuracy Trade-off AI-driven responses are designed to prioritize speed and efficiency, delivering information to requestors almost instantaneously. AI platforms are programmed to analyze vast data sets and generate content within seconds. But unsurprisingly, producing content using shortcuts can come at the cost of factual reliability. AI fills in gaps in its \u201cknowledge\u201d with educated guesses. When it doesn\u2019t \u201cknow\u201d something, AI algorithms typically rely on mathematical probability to provide a likely answer. But if we don\u2019t fact-check that and just accept the answer as truth, we are going to run into factuality issues. Risks of \u201cHallucinations\u201d in AI Outputs AI-generated content can contain many inaccuracies, ranging from misinformation to false citations and non-existent sources. When AI produces such content, it is referred to as an \u2018AI hallucination.\u2019 This term describes the generation of false but plausible information.

Following this move, marketers may face new challenges in maintaining authority and trust on the platform, leaving brands to reconsider the use of AI-generated content and prioritize messaging crafted by humans, for humans. While this should help improve transparency, the shift is reshaping content marketing strategies and forcing marketers to take new considerations into account. Below, members of Forbes Agency Council explore different ways this change could impact marketing on LinkedIn and offer practical advice to help marketers adapt their approaches and stay ahead of the curve. 1. AI Will Provide Ideas And Inspiration This is an excellent move by LinkedIn to bring more transparency to the platform. AI should always be used for ideas and inspiration, but not as the final source of content generation. This should inspire marketers to find a direction and plan and write content that resonates with their audience. - Daksh Sharma, Iffort 2. Authenticity Will Be Emphasized Marketers who do the work should appreciate that authenticity matters. If we use AI to do all the work, then we aren\u2019t doing our jobs right. My team uses AI for efficiency, but we don\u2019t use it to replace our brains. We recognize that allowing AI to create content will lead to platforms that do not have real people on them. A premium focus on authenticity is the right approach. It\u2019s a good thing. - Monica Alvarez-Mitchell, Pulse Creative, LLC 3. Lines Will Need To Be Drawn Humanity will benefit when AI- and non-AI-produced content is marked on social networks.

In this post, we break down the four biggest benefits of AI-powered drug labeling. New players in the pharmaceutical industry are scaling their AI capabilities fast and creating significant value. However, the applications of AI are diverse and these companies need to determine where and how AI-powered tools can most add value for them. One area where AI-powered tools have the potential to make a significant, tangible impact is drug labeling. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore the top four benefits of AI-powered drug labeling and how these benefits combat industry challenges. 4 Biggest Benefits AI Brings to Drug Labeling #1 \u2013 AI Ensures Sustained Quality & Compliance One of the biggest challenges in the pharmaceutical label authoring space is ensuring quality and compliance. Since most existing systems and processes cannot easily transform Core Data Sheets (CCDS) to local label formats (USPI, SmPC, etc.), the quality of submission is at risk from manual errors (i.e., incorrectly copying and pasting) and delays. Further, current processes make it difficult for labeling teams and regulatory affairs professionals alike to understand how and why a label was rendered over time; pharmaceutical companies must engage in time-consuming back-and-forth with regulators to identify and validate specific changes within a given label. Similarly, when a label update is required, labeling teams must determine if there are other documents that need to be reviewed and subsequently updated. In the absence of automated change management and branching, identifying all the right documents to update can be difficult. Introducing AI-powered, life sciences-trained tools into the drug labeling process can increase quality and compliance while reducing the time and complexity of curre",

Log In Sign Up Home Opinion Artificial Intelligence The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling of AI-Generated Media by Alex Cooke December 27, 2024 16 Comments Facebook X 16 Comments In the digital age, information flows at speeds and scales that are unprecedented in human history. Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency.

Username or E-mail Research / Insights on current and emerging industry topics Not disclosing AI-generated content negatively impacts trust Artificial intelligence (AI) is generating a new era of content creation. However, with this innovation comes the challenge of distinguishing AI-generated content from human-made material. This creates another issue media companies must grapple with to build and maintain audience trust. Mozilla\u2019s latest report, In Transparency We Trust?, delves into the transformative impact of AI-generated content and its challenges.

The report also raises concerns about AI-generated content and social media\u2019s powerful reach \u2015 intensifying the spread of algorithmic preferences and emotionally charged material. Where generative AI falls on the synthetic content spectrum AI-generated content is a subset of synthetic content. It includes images, videos, sounds, or any other form generated, edited, or enabled by artificial intelligence. Synthetic content exists on a spectrum with varying degrees of artificiality. One end of the spectrum features raw content, comprising hand-drawn illustrations, unaltered photographs, and human-written texts. These elements are untouched, representing the most natural form of creative expression. Moving along the spectrum is minimally edited content. Subtle refinements characterize this stage, like using Grammarly for text refinement or adjusting image contrast with photo editing apps. These adjustments enhance the quality and clarity of the content while maintaining its original essence. Stepping up from minimally processed content is ultra-processed, where automated methods and software play a more significant role in altering or enhancing human-generated material.

Artificial intelligence has turbocharged state efforts to crack down on internet freedoms over the past year. Governments and political actors around the world, in both democracies and autocracies, are using AI to generate texts, images, and video to manipulate public opinion in their favor and to automatically censor critical online content. In a new report released by Freedom House, a human rights advocacy group, researchers documented the use of generative AI in 16 countries \u201cto sow doubt, smear opponents, or influence public debate.\u201d The annual report, Freedom on the Net, scores and ranks countries according to their relative degree of internet freedom, as measured by a host of factors like internet shutdowns, laws limiting online expression, and retaliation for online speech. The 2023 edition, released on October 4, found that global internet freedom declined for the 13th consecutive year, driven in part by the proliferation of artificial intelligence. \u201cInternet freedom is at an all-time low, and advances in AI are actually making this crisis even worse,\u201d says Allie Funk, a researcher on the report.

In the third blog of our blog series 'AI and Manipulation': an interview with policy advisor Nadia Benaissa from Bits of Freedom and Richard Rogers, Professor of New Media and Digital Culture at the University of Amsterdam. In short How is AI used to manipulate us on digital and social media? According to Nadia Benaissa, policy advisor at Bits of Freedom, manipulation is based on the collection of huge amounts of data. \u201cThe platforms want to know users better than they know themselves - what scares them, makes them laugh, what they search on Google or what spelling mistakes they make. This information produces a psychological profile of potential voters, which can be used by companies to target them with information or misinformation they would be sensitive to\u201d, notes Benaissa, referring to manipulation during the 2016 US elections. Advertisements, news articles, fun quizzes or other posts influence people to form a certain opinion.\u00a0\u00a0 Artificial intelligence techniques such as machine learning and natural language processing, are used to analyse the data and learn what users like \u2013 and to consequently supply more of that content. Prof. Richard Rogers from the University of Amsterdam explains this is referred to as 'content optimisation'. \u201cWe could consider this a first form of manipulation, although we call it optimisation. The question is: what is being optimised?\u201d, says Rogers. The\u00a0Facebook Files revealed that Facebook favored posts tagged as angry. The result is an anger-driven feed since the platform algorithms favor angry, even hateful commentary as long as it gathers attention. Such background arrangements made by platform algorithms can be seen as one type of manipulation. \u201cThe question is: which content is being optimised through AI?\u201d The second type of manipulation comes from other users.

A phone call from the US president, covert recordings of politicians, false video clips of newsreaders, and surprising photographs of celebrities. A wide array of media can now be generated or altered with artificial intelligence, sometimes mimicking real people, often very convincingly. These kinds of deepfakes are cropping up on the internet, particularly on social media. AI-generated fake intimate images of pop star Taylor Swift recently led to X temporarily blocking all searches of the singer. And it\u2019s not just celebrities whose likeness is faked: deepfakes of news presenters and politicians are also making the rounds. In a year in which around 2 billion people are eligible to vote in 50 elections, can AI-generated disinformation impact democratic outcomes? And how is this going to affect journalists reporting on the campaigns? I contacted journalists and experts from Spain, Mexico and India to find out. The issue If we were to take a snapshot of the deepfakes circulating in recent months, we would find a range of individuals whose likenesses have been faked, for a range of aims. Popular targets are those with abundant examples of their (real) appearance and voice available online: celebrities, newsreaders, politicians. The purpose of these fakes ranges from satire to scams to disinformation. Politicians have appeared in deepfakes peddling financial scams. The UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, for example, was impersonated in a range of video ads which appeared on Facebook, as have TV newsreaders, whose image is often used to advertise fake \u2018investment opportunities\u2019, sometimes involving celebrities who may have also been faked.

But what are critics to do when propaganda is obvious? In the late 1930s the Institute for Propaganda Analysis faced this question while investigating the public politicking of A&P, then the largest retailer in the United States. While contemporary critics lambasted A&P for their secretive campaign, particularly their use of front groups, A&P used many relatively overt methods of propaganda to win political victories. Propaganda analysis then, as now, fixated on the concealed, failing to adequately critique conspicuous communicative power.

Abstract Over the last decade, transparency reports have been adopted by most large information technology companies. These reports provide important information on the requests tech companies receive from state actors around the world and the ways they respond to these requests, including what content the companies remove from platforms they own. In theory, such reports shall make inner workings of companies more transparent, in particular with respect to their collaboration with state actors. They shall also allow users and external entities (e.g., researchers or watchdogs) to assess to what extent companies adhere to their own policies on user privacy and content moderation as well as to the principles formulated by global entities that advocate for the freedom of expression and privacy online such as the Global Network Initiative or Santa Clara Principles. However, whether the current state of transparency reports actually is conducive to meaningful transparency remains an open question.

This sentence was written by an AI\u2014or was it? OpenAI\u2019s new chatbot, ChatGPT, presents us with a problem: How will we know whether what we read online is written by a human or a machine? Since it was released in late November, ChatGPT has been used by over a million people. It has the AI community enthralled, and it is clear the internet is increasingly being flooded with AI-generated text. People are using it to come up with jokes, write children\u2019s stories, and craft better emails.\u00a0 ChatGPT is OpenAI\u2019s spin-off of its large language model GPT-3, which generates remarkably human-sounding answers to questions that it\u2019s asked. The magic\u2014and danger\u2014of these large language models lies in the illusion of correctness. The sentences they produce look right\u2014they use the right kinds of words in the correct order. But the AI doesn\u2019t know what any of it means. These models work by predicting the most likely next word in a sentence. They haven\u2019t a clue whether something is correct or false, and they confidently present information as true even when it is not.\u00a0 In an already polarized, politically fraught online world, these AI tools could further distort the information we consume. If they are rolled out into the real world in real products, the consequences could be devastating.\u00a0 We\u2019re in desperate need of ways to differentiate between human- and AI-written text in order to counter potential misuses of the technology, says Irene Solaiman, policy director at AI startup Hugging Face, who used to be an AI researcher at OpenAI and studied AI output detection for the release of GPT-3\u2019s predecessor GPT-2.\u00a0 New tools will also be crucial to enforcing bans on AI-generated text and code, like the one recently announced by Stack Overflow, a website where coders can ask for help.

Present and future concerns Generative AI is revolutionizing content creation across digital platforms, offering tools that automate and enhance the production of text, images, and videos. This technology not only streamlines workflows but also personalizes user experiences through sophisticated algorithms. However, as generative AI continues to evolve, it raises significant concerns regarding the authenticity of content and the potential spread of misinformation. The challenge lies in developing and implementing effective detection methods to distinguish between human and AI-generated content, ensuring integrity and trust in digital media as we move forward. How AI impacts on social media Artificial intelligence (AI) significantly shapes social media by streamlining content creation and management, which enhances user engagement and personalizes experiences. However, it also introduces challenges such as the proliferation of fake news, deepfakes, and sophisticated misinformation, making it difficult for users to distinguish between authentic and AI-generated content. This downside can appear because of creators who fail to verify the veracity of content, but also ill-intentioned users who benefit from these tools for their wrong-doings.

Because of Artificial Intelligence\u2019s remarkable strides in the field of education, detecting AI-generated content such as assignments and homework can be challenging for teachers. Although AI can help students to understand complex concepts and visualize their lessons, it should not be used to write assignments for them. Many AI tools successfully mimic human writing and compositions, but it is not impossible to detect AI-authored texts. The following are some ways teachers can tell if assignments and content are generated by AI and how to identify AI content in the classroom: Inconsistencies in writing:\u00a0AI-generated texts often lack the natural inconsistencies that may be found in human writing. Often (unless a human is a writing expert), any writing by a person will lack consistent style, tone, and vocabulary\u00a0throughout\u00a0an assignment. Additionally, very abrupt shifts in tone may also indicate that an AI tool has been used. Lack of personal experience:\u00a0AI tools obviously don\u2019t have emotions or personal experience, so they are unable to provide individual anecdotes in writing. Most writing by AI models lack the distinctive touch of a human, so very impersonal writing may often be AI-generated. Different from students\u2019 previous work: Another way to identify AI-generated content is by comparing assignments with a child\u2019s previously submitted work. Every child\u2019s writing style\u2014although bound to evolve with time\u2014is reflective of their personal preferences, sentence structures, and vocabularies. If any text submitted by a child dramatically differs from anything they have submitted in the past, it may have been AI-generated.

To combat cheating and fraud, AI content detection tools were developed using algorithms specifically designed to detect and flag AI-generated content. Although still in the early stages of development, these apps have already shown promise as an effective way to deter students from manipulating AI writing tools to fabricate essays, papers, or even entire dissertations. To gain insight into AI content detection tools, we must explore the algorithms that drive them. In this article, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s examine several of the various methods utilized. What is a Language Model? A language model is an AI algorithm trained to predict the next word in a sequence. It accomplishes this by analyzing huge amounts of text data and leveraging probability to determine the most likely outcome. Language models are essential components of all AI writing tools, enabling them to generate content. This same capability also makes them invaluable for detecting AI-generated content \u00e2\u0080\u0093 after all, it takes one to know one! What Are the Different AI Detection Models? BERT BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is an AI language model in 2018 by Google researchers. It utilizes a bidirectional approach to language modeling, meaning it looks at the context of both the preceding and succeeding words to make predictions. The bidirectional capability is due to the model being pre-trained on two tasks. The first is Masked Language Modeling (MLM). It is the task of masking a word in a sentence ",

Unlike humans who can learn from a few examples, AI algorithms need thousands or even millions of examples to detect patterns and learn effectively. Any errors, biases, or inconsistencies in the training data labels can significantly impact model performance. Subject matter experts who deeply understand the data are needed for careful labeling. Images, video, audio, and text data often contain nuanced details that generalist labelers could easily mislabel. Domain knowledge is key. For example, doctors should label medical images to accurately distinguish between related diseases or anomalies. Highly skilled linguists or native speakers must label text corpora in order for natural language processing models to learn the rules and cadence of a specific language accurately. Expert labeling early in the data annotation process sets the stage for AI model success. Technology companies building machine learning products invest significant resources into onboarding, training, and quality management to empower data labelers to provide insightful ground truth labels for the algorithms' training. Complex Data Types Necessitate Specialized Labelers Images, video, audio, and text data require different types of expertise for accurate labeling. For image recognition, specific objects, landscapes, animals, or activities must be identified clearly and consistently in a large collection of pictures. Video action recognition similarly relies on skilled labelers who can interpret and categorize complex human movements across many frames.

Abstract Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large volume of academic work suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce people\u2019s belief in and sharing of content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: (1) communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools) versus (2) diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). Next, we summarize results from two large-scale experiments demonstrating that labeling can, under certain conditions, meaningfully decrease individuals\u2019 likelihood of believing and engaging with misleading, AI-generated images. Finally, we highlight several important issues and challenges that must be considered wh",

Political Misinformation Is Not an AI Problem. Technology isn\u2019t the problem\u2014or the solution. By Sayash Kapoor & Arvind Narayanan December 13, 2024 AI-generated misinformation was one of the top concerns during the 2024 U.S. presidential election. In January 2024, the World Economic Forum\u00a0claimed that \u201cmisinformation and disinformation is the most severe short-term risk the world faces\u201d and that \u201cAI is amplifying manipulated and distorted information that could destabilize societies.\u201d News headlines about elections in 2024 tell a similar story: In contrast, in our past writing, we predicted that AI would not lead to a misinformation apocalypse. When Meta released its open-weight large language model (called LLaMA), we argued that it would not lead to a tidal wave of misinformation. And in a follow-up essay, we pointed out that the distributionof misinformation is the key bottleneck for influence operations, and while generative AI reduces the cost of creating misinformation, it does not reduce the cost of distributing it. A few other researchers have made similar arguments. Which of these two perspectives better fits the facts? Fortunately, we have the evidence of AI use in elections that took place around the globe in 2024 to help answer this question. Many news outlets and research projects have compiled known instances of AI-generated text and media and their impact. Instead of speculating about AI\u2019s potential, we can look at its real-world impact to date. We analyzed every instance of AI use in elections collected by the WIRED AI Elections",

The synthetic images that emerged were\u00a0often crude,\u00a0unconvincing\u00a0and costly to produce, especially when other kinds of misinformation were so inexpensive and easy to spread on social media. The threat posed by AI and so-called\u00a0deepfakes\u00a0always seemed a year or two away. No more. Sophisticated generative AI tools can now create\u00a0cloned human voices\u00a0and\u00a0hyper-realistic images, videos and audio in seconds, at minimal cost. When strapped to powerful social media algorithms, this fake and digitally created content can spread far and fast and target highly specific audiences, potentially taking campaign dirty tricks to a new low. The implications for the 2024 campaigns and elections are as large as they are troubling: Generative AI can not only rapidly produce targeted campaign emails, texts or videos, it also could be used to\u00a0mislead voters, impersonate candidates and undermine elections on a scale and at a speed not yet seen.

Since May, websites hosting AI-created false articles have increased by more than 1,000 percent, ballooning from 49 sites to more than 600, according to NewsGuard, an organization that tracks misinformation. Historically, propaganda operations have relied on armies of low-paid workers or highly coordinated intelligence organizations to build sites that appear to be legitimate. But AI is making it easy for nearly anyone \u2014 whether they are part of a spy agency or just a teenager in their basement \u2014 to create these outlets, producing content that is at times hard to differentiate from real news. One AI-generated article recounted a made-up story about Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s psychiatrist, a NewsGuard investigation found, alleging that he had died and left behind a note suggesting the involvement of the Israeli prime minister.

Also notable in the survey data is that a strong majority of respondents believed the U.S. government should enact regulation requiring AI-generated content to be clearly labeled as such.\u00a0 Soon after, the U.S. General Accounting Office issued an update stating that deepfakes \u2014 video, audio or images that seem real but were manipulated with AI \u2014 have been used to try to influence elections (as well as create non-consensual pornography).\u00a0\u00a0 The GAO found that researchers \u2014 in response to President Biden\u2019s\u00a0executive order\u00a0last year calling for private industry to step up \u2014 are developing new and stronger ways to detect deepfakes, most notably\u00a0labeling AI-generated content with secure watermarking.

Sorab Ghaswalla \u00b7Follow 8 min read \u00b7 Dec 20, 2023 -- Listen Share Photo by Tamara Malaniy on Unsplash A new research paper, \u201cHow to Label AI-Generated Content,\u201d has sparked renewed discussion on the challenge of labeling content created by Generative Artificial Intelligence (gen-AI). This focus on labeling gains significance as some countries implement AI-related laws, highlighting the need for a reevaluation. The study, authored by Ziv Epstein, Cathy Fang, Antonio Alonso Arechar, and MIT Sloan Professor David Rand, found that terms like \u201cAI generated\u201d and \u201cAI manipulated\u201d were closely associated with content produced using artificial intelligence in the United States, Mexico, Brazil, India, and China. Conversely, labels like \u201cdeepfake\u201d and \u201cmanipulated\u201d were mainly linked to deceptive content, regardless of whether AI was involved. The paper, co-authored by Rand, Epstein, Fang, and Arechar, raises a crucial question: Can these labels effectively address the challenges of fake news and deepfakes? However, delving into the issue reveals that tackling this challenge is more complex than simply labeling content as \u201cfake.\u201d Factors That Come Into Play Before labeling content, several questions need to be answered, including this one: should the process be intent-oriented? Meaning \u2014 did someone want to deceive others to begin with? Or was it a case of a bona fide error? The next in line is \u2014 irrespective of intent, does the content collateral retain the potential to influence, harm or deceive? And\u2026.will not all of this simply \u201cnormalize\u201d deepfakes? The Role of Labels In today\u2019s content ecosystem, AI has begun playing an increasingly important role. From generating creative text formats to manipulating images and videos, AI tools are becoming more sophisticated and accessible, leading ",

As AI-generated media become more mainstream, many have argued that text-based labels, captions, and watermarks are crucial for transparency. But do these labels actually work? Maybe not. For a label to work, it needs to be legible. Is the text big enough to read? Are the words accessible? It should also provide audiences with meaningful context on how the media has been created and used. And in the best cases, it also discloses intent: Why has this piece of media been put into the world?

The AI Paradox in Marketing The rise of AI in marketing presents a fascinating paradox. Is it the beginning of the end? Gartner surveyed 405 marketing leaders and found that\u00a063% plan to invest in generative AI within the next two years. Of those respondents, over half of them believe these tools are more beneficial than risky.

In recent years, calls for food and allergen transparency and a greater focus on health have consumers paying even more attention to these labels and the ingredients listed on them. Recently, however, we\u2019ve seen an increase in new regulations about what food and allergen labeling looks like and what information labels can (and can\u2019t) include. In some countries around the world, food manufacturers are required to publish front-of-package (FOP) labels to promote better consumer awareness and sway dietary choices. Usually, the regulations require a mandatory symbol, icon, or other visual cues on the front of food packaging that communicates healthy food choices and other critical ingredient information to consumers. But how do FOP labels help consumers and brands when the same information can be found on the Nutrition Facts panel? Let\u2019s consider the various types of FOPs and their benefits.

Product labels are more than simply stickers or tags; they have a powerful impact on consumer decision-making. For example, in a study, 68% of consumers were willing to pay more for food products labeled as cruelty-free. This statistic highlights the importance of labels to provide vital information to consumers. Labels offer ingredient details, nutritional facts, usage instructions, and safety warnings. By conveying essential details, labels can influence consumers to make wise choices about the products they buy. Labels go beyond providing information; they are instrumental in building brand identity and establishing a strong visual presence in the market. In a crowded marketplace, where countless products compete for attention, an eye-catching label design can make all the difference in capturing the attention of potential customers and differentiating a brand from its competitors.

Using the NFP as an example, the paper shows that information disclosures are often poorly designed and fail to actually inform consumers. They often fail to account for how consumers perceive and interpret information or for the differences in their socioeconomic backgrounds. Thus, it may not be consumers\u2019 behavioral biases but rather poor policy design and implementation that is responsible for the NFP\u2019s ineffectiveness. Consequently, the paper argues that nutrition labels should follow smart disclosure principles, which emphasize information salience and usability. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently decided to update the Nutrition Facts panel (NFP). A new study for the Mercatus Center at George Mason University explains that it is the flaws in the NFP\u2019s design that prevent it from having a greater impact on consumers\u2019 choices, and that the redesigned label does not correct those flaws. The NFP\u2019s ineffectiveness has led some to abandon information disclosure attempts and instead advocate for more intrusive paternalistic policies such as taxes and bans on certain types of food. The NFP\u2019s failure, however, is due",

But the labels did influence a limited set of shoppers while the educational campaign was active to buy less junk food and more fresh produce. Taste. Price. Convenience.

Claims about how food was grown, produced, prepared and packaged\u2014and, in particular how the earth and its inhabitants were treated along the way\u2014have cropped up in nearly every aisle in the supermarket. It\u2019s hard to avoid \u201cfair trade\u201d coffee, \u201ccage-free\u201d eggs, \u201crBST-free\u201d milk, or \u201cNon-GMO\u201d orange juice, not to mention products claiming to be \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201corganic.\u201d Process labeling is coming to predominate our food marketing, quite often taking precedence over more traditional food attributes.

Why Proper Labeling is Important ByMichael Dillon February 3, 2023May 7, 2024 Food labels are often misleading because companies want their products to sell, even to health-conscious consumers. They convince these people to buy highly processed and unhealthy goods by labeling them with various health claims such as \u201csugar-free,\u201d \u201cnaturally sweetened,\u201d and \u201clow-fat.\u201d Food labeling can be challenging to read, especially if the consumers are unfamiliar with any of the ingredients mentioned. In a study entitled \u201cConsumer Knowledge about Food Labeling and Fraud,\u201d over 65% of people admitted having difficulty understanding the information on food products. About 55% declared that they don\u2019t trust the details provided by manufacturers. To mitigate this issue of food fraud, or the intentional deception of suppliers to consumers about the food content and quality, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) updated its regulations to increase oversight or enforcement of goods labeled organic. The USDA now requires companies to have an import certification from the department\u2019s National Organic Program. Dishonest or faulty labelings will affect a brand\u2019s image, tarnishing its reputation. Food fraud can even lead to the suspension of business\u2019 operations. Thus, businesses must understand and comply with these regulations when creating food labels. Understanding Why Food Labels Are Important Food labels are important because they inform consumers about what the products contain, guiding them on how to safely use and store the goods.

Abstract Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large volume of academic work suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce people\u2019s belief in and sharing of content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: (1) communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools) versus (2) diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). Next, we summarize results from two large-scale experiments demonstrating that labeling can, under certain conditions, meaningfully decrease individuals\u2019 likelihood of believing and engaging with misleading, AI-generated images. Finally, we highlight several important issues and challenges that must be considered wh",

Please consider using an alternative such as Microsoft Edge, Chrome, or Firefox. The Impact of GMO Labeling on Consumer Choices [Food Marketing] 1.19.2022 Youngju Kim, SunAh Kim and Neeraj Arora Genetically modified (GM) foods are widespread worldwide, but they are also controversial and subject to regulatory oversight. For example, in the United States, all GM foods will be required to display a \u201cBioengineered\u201d label by 2022, a policy decision that\u00a0is heavily debated. Most scientists claim that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in foods are safe for human consumption and offer societal benefits such as better nutritional content. In contrast, many consumers have an overall negative attitude toward GMOs. These conflicting views create a fundamental tension for policymakers in how GM-foods\u00a0should be labeled. A new Journal of Marketing study examines the impact of different GMO labeling policy regimes on products consumers choose.\u00a0To reconcile the diverging views that scientists and consumers have on GMOs, policymakers all over the world adopt either a voluntary or a mandatory GMO labeling policy. In a voluntary labeling regime, food producers who make non-GM products disclose such information through a \u201cnon-GMO\u201d label. Conversely, in a mandatory\u00a0labeling regime, food manufacturers are required to include labels such as \u201ccontains GMO\u201d when their foods are genetically modified. To understand how GMO labeling policies\u00a0impact\u00a0consumer choice, our research team conducted four studies.In Study 1, we examine whether consumer choice depends on the GMO labeling regime. The results show that each labeling regime greatly affects consumers\u2019 demand for GM foods. Labels such as \u201cnon-GMO\u201d (absence labeling) and \u201ccontains GMO\u201d (presence labeling) serve as negative signals for GM foods and tend to shrink their market share. The\u00a0market share shrinkage effect\u00a0is stronger under the mandatory policy (presence labeling) than under voluntary",

ABSTRACT Health warning labels (HWLs) could reduce harmful consumption of food (including non-alcoholic drinks) and alcoholic drinks. A systematic review with meta-analysis using Cochrane methods was conducted to assess the impact on selection (including hypothetical selection) or consumption of food or alcoholic drink products displaying image-and-text (sometimes termed \u2018pictorial\u2019) and text-only HWLs. Fourteen randomised controlled trials were included, three for alcohol, eleven for food. For the primary outcomes, eleven studies measured selection and one measured consumption (two measured only other secondary outcomes). Meta-analysis of twelve comparisons from nine studies (n=12,635) found HWLs reduced selection of the targeted product compared with no HWL (RR=0.74 (95%CI 0.68\u20130.80)), with participants 26% less likely to choose a product displaying a HWL.

MIT IDE \u00b7Follow Published in MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy \u00b7 5 min read \u00b7 Dec 4, 2023 -- 12 Listen Share By Brian Eastwood, MIT Sloan In late October, President Joe Biden issued a wide-ranging executive order on AI security and safety. The order includes new standards and best practices for clearly labeling AI-generated content, in part to help Americans determine whether communications that appear to be from the government are authentic. This points to a concern that as generative AI becomes more widely used, manipulated content could easily spread false information. As the executive order indicates, content labels are one strategy for combatting the spread of misinformation. But what are the right terms to use? Which ones will be widely understood by the public as indicating that something has been generated or manipulated by artificial intelligence technology or is intentionally misleading? A new working paper co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand found that across the United States, Mexico, Brazil, India, and China, people associated certain terms, such as \u201cAI generated\u201d and \u201cAI manipulated,\u201d most closely with content created using AI. Conversely, the labels \u201cdeepfake\u201d and \u201cmanipulated\u201d were most associated with misleading content, whether AI created it or not. Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash These results show that most people have a reasonable understanding of what AI means, which is a good starting point. They also suggest that any effort to label content needs to consider the overarching goal, said Rand, a professor of management science and brain and cognitive sciences. Rand co-authored the paper with Ziv Epstein, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford; MIT graduate researcher ",

Product labels are more than simply stickers or tags; they have a powerful impact on consumer decision-making. For example, in a study, 68% of consumers were willing to pay more for food products labeled as cruelty-free. This statistic highlights the importance of labels to provide vital information to consumers. Labels offer ingredient details, nutritional facts, usage instructions, and safety warnings. By conveying essential details, labels can influence consumers to make wise choices about the products they buy. Labels go beyond providing information; they are instrumental in building brand identity and establishing a strong visual presence in the market. In a crowded marketplace, where countless products compete for attention, an eye-catching label design can make all the difference in capturing the attention of potential customers and differentiating a brand from its competitors. Jump To Section: What Are Product Labels? Product labels are tags that give consumers essential details such as ingredients, usage instructions, safety warnings, and branding elements. They serve as a direct information channel between brands and consumers, conveying necessary details and building brand identity. Product labels influence purchase decisions, help businesses avoid legal liabilities, and differentiate products from competitors. A well-designed label can captivate shoppers and pique their interest. By leveraging effective label design, brands can effectively communicate product features, benefits, and value to create a strong impact on consumers. Accurate and informative labeling is of utmost importance for maintaining consumer trust. Studies show that consumers generally trust product labels and rely on them for making purchasing decisions. However, a single erroneous or false claim can ruin that trust, tarnishing a brand\u2019s reputation and exposing them to potential legal iss",

In this guide, we\u2019ll explore three popular types of labeling systems\u2014print-and-apply, pressure sensitive and shrink sleeve systems\u2014to help you determine which is the best fit for your products. Print-and-apply Print-and-apply labeling systems are ideal for businesses that need to print labels on-demand and apply them directly to products or packaging. These systems are versatile and can handle various label types, sizes and materials. The key advantage of print-and-apply systems is their customization capability. They allow for real-time printing of variable data such as barcodes, batch numbers and expiration dates, making them highly efficient for high-speed production environments. Plus, advanced print-and-apply systems ensure precise label placement, reducing the risk of mislabeling and ensuring compliance with industry standards. This makes them particularly suitable for products requiring frequent label changes, high-volume manufacturing environments and applications needing variable information on each label. Pressure sensitive Pressure sensitive labeling systems are widely used across various industries due to their simplicity and versatility. These systems use adhesive-backed labels that are applied to products using pressure, without the need for heat, solvents or water. One of the primary benefits of pressure sensitive labels is their ease of use, which makes them a cost-effective solution. They can accommodate a wide range of label shapes and sizes, suitable for flat, curved or irregular surfaces. Furthermore, pressure sensitive labels provide strong adhesion and are resistant to moisture, chemicals ",

These labels can contain crucial information, such as barcodes, lot numbers, expiration dates, and other important data that ensures traceability and regulatory compliance. \u00a0 The importance of labeling systems has grown with globalization and the need to comply with international standards. Modern systems not only print high-quality labels, but also integrate everything needed to improve the durability and readability of labels under various conditions. \u00a0 Print and Apply Labeling System (Print & Apply) Print and apply (Print & Apply) systems combine label printing with automatic label application on boxes and pallets. They are widely used in industries such as food and beverage, where speed and accuracy are essential. \u00a0 These systems can be easily integrated into existing production lines and are highly versatile, allowing label printing and application on various types of packaging, from boxes to pallets. \u00a0 Types of labeling systems Specific labeling systems for boxes Case-specific labeling systems\u00a0are designed to handle the unique demands of labeling boxes of various sizes and materials. These systems enable the printing and application of high-contrast labels in a single step, ensuring that critical information such as barcodes, lot numbers and expiry dates is always cle",

We typically find them used in two ways: as links to chunks of information on other pages (usually within the context of navigation systems, as index terms, or as labels for links), and as headings that break up and identify the chunks of information on the same page (much like the heading on this printed page). Of course, a single label can do double duty; for example, the link Contact Us could lead to a page that uses the title label Contact Us. Labels Within Navigation Systems Navigation system labels demand consistent application more than any other type of labeling system. Navigation systems, as we described in Chapter 4, occur again and again within a web site. Just as users rely on navigational systems to be positioned on a page consistently and look the same throughout the site, they rely on their labels to work in a consistent, familiar way, as in Figure 5.1. Effectively applied labels are integral to building this sense of familiarity, so they\u2019d better not change from page to page. That\u2019s why using the label Main, on one page, Main Page on another, and Home elsewhere will surely destroy the familiarity that the user needs when navigating a site.

A variety of methods have been used in an attempt to mitigate the spread of misinformation and fake news ranging from using machine learning to detect fake news to paying fact checkers to manually fact check media to ensure its accuracy. In this paper, three studies were conducted at two universities with different regional demographic characteristics to gain a better understanding of respondents\u2019 perception of online media labeling techniques. The first study deals with what fields should appear on a media label. The second study looks into what types of informative labels respondents would use. The third focuses on blocking type labels.

This content has shown to have the capability to manipulate individuals\u2019 beliefs, voting and activities. It is a demonstrably effective way for foreign adversaries to create domestic strife in open societies. It is also, by virtue of the magnitude of content, very difficult to combat. Solutions ranging from censorship to inaction have been proposed. One solution that has been suggested is labeling content to indicate its accuracy or characteristics. This would provide an indication or even warning regarding content that may be deceptive in nature, helping content consumers make informed decisions. If successful, this approach would avoid limitations on content creators\u2019 freedom of speech while also mitigating the problems caused by deceptive content. To determine whether this approach could be effective, this paper presents the results of a national survey aimed at understanding how content labeling impacts online content consumption decision making. To ascertain the impact of potential labeling techniques on different portions of the population, it analyzes labels\u2019 efficacy in terms of income level, political party affiliation and online usage time.

By: Samantha Bradshaw, Mona Elswah, and Antonella Perini Recently, social media platforms have introduced several measures to counter misleading information. Among these measures are \u201cstate-media labels\u201d which help users identify and evaluate the credibility of state-backed news. YouTube was the first platform to introduce labels that provide information about state-backed news channels. While previous work has examined the efficiency of information labels in controlled lab settings, few studies have examined how state-media labels affect users\u2019 perceptions of content from state-backed outlets. This article proposes new methodological and theoretical approaches to investigate the effect of state-media labels on users\u2019 engagement with content. Drawing on a content analysis of 8,071 YouTube comments posted before and after the labeling of five state-funded channels (Al Jazeera English [AJE], China Global Television Network, Russia Today [RT], TRT World, and Voice of America [VOA] News), this article analyses the effect that YouTube\u2019s labels had on users\u2019 engagement with state-backed media content.

Civic Signal Being Amplified When To Use It What Is Its Intended Impact Reduce belief in and willingness to spread misleading or false content. Evidence That It Works Evidence That It Works Across a number of survey experiment studies, researchers find that labeling misleading content with warnings based on professional fact-checkers' evaluations - for example \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisputed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRated false,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalse information checked by independent fact-checkers\u00e2\u0080\u009d - can reduce participants belief in false news or their reported willingness to share misinformation. One study, discussed below, finds similar results for content marked as false by community members. Labels, however, should be used carefully as several studies suggest they have the potential to backfire. One survey experiment (Mena, 2020) tests if Facebook users are more likely to say they would share news stories depending on whether a story is flagged as disputed by professional fact checkers. Participants observed a Facebook post containing false news content with or without a warning label (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisputed by Snopes.com and PolitiFact\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Respondents who observed the label on top of the post had significantly lower intentions to share the deceiving information on social media than respondents who did not see the label (Cohen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s d = \u00e2\u0088\u00920.36). (Note: we report effect sizes using the metrics in the authors' paper. All effects we include are statistically significant, unless otherwise stated.) Several studies show similar positive effects on how much subjects believe false information when it is flagged based on professional fact checker ratings. For example, in Clayton et al. (2020) participants observed a replica of a Facebook newsfeed containing false and true news stories, with warnings attached to the misleading posts. The authors found that \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisputed\u00e2",

A content label is a visual and/or textual attachment to a piece of user-generated content intended to contextualize that content for the viewer. Examples of content labels are fact-checks or additional information. At their essence, content labels are simply information about information. If a social media platform decides to label a piece of content, how does the current body of social science inform the labeling practice",

To read the first part, click here. Media Literacy As discussed in our policy framework section, our last disinformation policy category is Media Literacy. Media Literacy is a broad category that can include initiatives to educate citizens on identifying disinformation, promoting critical information practices, or fact-checking and flagging disinformation. This category encompasses a range of measures, such as videos that teach school children how to find trusted information sources, some forms of content moderation, and flagging content for users to make them more aware of disinformation. Though the boundary between different disinformation policy categories can be fuzzy, the critical distinction for media literacy is that the policy is focused on consumers of information (or disinformation), with policies aiming to educate the consumers and shore up their defenses\u2014that is, to increase their resilience against\u2014disinformation campaigns. Positive content moderation can be considered both a content moderation and media literacy disinformation policy and illustrates how boundaries overlap. As discussed in our content moderation section, positive content moderation is the promotion or dissemination of certain content, for example, Meta flagging COVID-19-related content on its platforms and attaching links to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s website to provide accurate information in real time and actively mitigate pandemic disinformation.[1] This is a form of positive content moderation because Meta is a social media platfor",

We\u2019ve published an account of our findings and a few recommendations on Poynter.org. The post below has slightly more detail on our methodology and a link to our data. To assess how well news organizations are labeling their articles, the Duke Reporters\u2019 Lab examined articles from 49 publications. The study was prompted by the ongoing public debate about declining trust in the news media. Some journalists and educators have said one way to improve trust is for people to better understand the type of content they\u2019re reading. Online journalism provides readers with access to thousands of news sources, but readers may not understand the type of article they\u2019re reading. Our hypothesis was that many news organizations do not label article types to indicate whether they are news, analysis, opinion or a review. Students in the Lab analyzed 49 news organizations \u2014 25 local newspapers and 24 national news and opinion websites. Students collected 25 articles from each organization \u2014 five articles from five different sections of the publication. For each piece of content, they note, among other things, if that article had a label, what the label said, if the label was clearly defined anywhere on the page and the size, location and color of the label. Our findings: * Of the 49 organizations analyzed, the Reporters\u2019 Lab found that only 20 of them \u2014 40 percent \u2014 labeled article type at least once in at least one section of their website. * Of the 20 organizations that did label article types, 16 of them \u2014 80 percent \u2014 only used labels in the opinion section. Those labels included editorial (used on 15 news sites), commentary (seven sites), column or columnist (six sites) and letters (seven s",

The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires labels on qualifying products to display three pieces of information: The identity of the product The name and location of the manufacturer, distributor or packer The net quantity of contents in terms of weight, measure, or numerical count stated in accordance with the metric system as well as inches and pounds on the principal display panel Declarations of quantity must appear in distinct contrast from other elements of the package, in an easy-to-read, bold typeface Under this act, measurements must comply with additional regulations set forth by the Office of Weights and Measures of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

Powered by enormous amounts of data, machine learning algorithms are incredibly good at learning and detecting patterns in data and making useful predictions, all without being explicitly programmed to do so. Trained on large amounts of image data, computer models can predict objects with very high accuracy. They can recognize faces, cars, and fruit, all without requiring a human to write software programs explicitly dictating how to identify them. Similarly, natural language processing models power modern voice assistants and chatbots we interact with daily. Trained on enormous amounts of audio and text data, these models can recognize speech, understand the context of written content, and translate between different languages. Instead of engineers attempting to hand-code these capabilities into software, machine learning engineers program these models with a large amount of relevant, clean data.

Your model is only as good as the data it's trained with, and part of the training process includes getting your data labeled quickly and accurately by highly skilled experts. However, many companies typically approach this process by gathering and quickly labeling as much data as they possibly can to train their model. In reality, AI teams today need to focus more on the quality of their data in order to add advanced capabilities and reasoning to their frontier and task-specific\u00a0 models. Having larger, low-quality datasets prolong the data labeling process and makes getting to production AI harder. Wading through a vast amount of unstructured data to get accurately labeled data requires a tremendous amount of patience, organization, and time. Ensuring that you have high quality data will save you time and money from decreased labeling costs. What is data labeling? Data labeling has become a broad term that can apply to everything from annotating specific data types to providing feedback and ratings on complex responses from generative AI (GenAI) and LLMs. Historically, it has referred to the task of annotating data such as images, PDFs, text, videos or audio with the purpose of helping to teach a machine learning model to make similar annotations. Labels can include bounding boxes and segmentation masks for image and text data, for example. With the rapid rise of GenAI, data labeling tools now often include powerful solutions for evaluating and rating multimodal AI models in a chat arena style experience, generating prompt/response pairs, evaluating step-by-step reasoning, and more. These advanced rating tasks are often performed by highly skilled experts in a specific topic, such as coding, math, physics, medicine, and finance.

Data labeling requires the identification of raw data (i.e., images, text files, videos), and then the addition of one or more labels to that data to specify its context for the models, allowing the machine learning model to make accurate predictions. Data labeling underpins different machine learning and deep learning use cases, including computer vision and natural language processing (NLP). Discover the power of integrating a data lakehouse strategy into your data architecture, including enhancements to scale AI and cost optimization opportunities. Companies integrate software, processes and data annotators to clean, structure and label data. This training data becomes the foundation for machine learning models. These labels allow analysts to isolate variables within datasets, and this, in turn, enables the selection of optimal data predictors for ML models. The labels identify the appropriate data vectors to be pulled in for model training, where the model, then, learns to make the best predictions. Along with machine assistance, data labeling tasks require \u201chuman-in-the-loop (HITL)\u201d participation. HITL leverages the judgment of human \u201cdata labelers\u201d toward creating, training, fine-tuning and testing ML models. They help guide the data labeling process by feeding the models datasets that are most applicable to a given project. Labeled data vs. unlabeled data \u00a0 Computers use labeled and unlabeled data to train ML models, but\u00a0what is the difference?

Data is often referred to as the new oil. However, raw data alone isn't enough to power effective AI models. To truly harness the power of AI, data must be meticulously labeled and categorized\u2014a process known as data labeling. This process is critical for training AI models to recognize patterns, make decisions, and generate accurate predictions. In this blog, we will explore the significance of AI data labeling, best practices for implementing it, and the role it plays in developing high-performing AI applications. What is AI Data Labeling? AI data labeling involves tagging or annotating datasets with meaningful labels that AI models can learn from. These labels can range from simple categorizations, like identifying objects in an image, to more complex annotations, such as recognizing sentiment in a text. Data labeling serves as the foundation upon which AI models are trained, enabling them to interpret new data accurately. For instance, in a machine learning model designed for image recognition, a dataset of images might be labeled with tags like \"cat,\" \"dog,\" or \"car.\" The AI uses these labels to learn the characteristics of each category, which it then applies when analyzing new, unlabeled images. The Importance of Data Labeling in AI 1. Enhancing Model Accuracy The accuracy of an AI model is directly tied to the quality of the data it is trained on. Properly labeled data ensures that the AI can distinguish between different categories, leading to more precise predictions. In contrast, poorly labeled data can confuse the model, leading to errors and inaccuracies. 2. Reducing Bias Bias in AI models is a significant concern, as it can lead to unfair or incorrect outcomes.

What is data labeling? While much of the world is celebrating AI systems that make time-consuming knowledge-based tasks so quick and easy, there are some who are shedding blood, sweat, and tears to make it possible. Thousands of workers are toiling away at creating training datasets, validating model outcomes, and mimicking computational responses to sustain the research, development, and use of AI models like ChatGPT, BERT, and Midjourney. A big part of that labor is data labeling. In a nutshell, data labeling is the curation of data for AI and machine learning applications. It involves providing raw data (images, audio, text, video) and adding one or more relevant labels to give context so that an AI model can learn from it. Examples of data labels could be the content of a photo (is it a bird or a plane?), speech in an audio recording (what words are used), or what's shown on an x-ray (a tumor). If you're someone who works in the area of data labeling, what follows will provide you with some guidance on when and how to collect and label data for ML and deep learning applications. Let's begin with when you might need to label raw data for training datasets. Labeled vs. unlabeled data ML and deep learning algorithms fall into three categories: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and semi-supervised learning. Whether you use labeled or unlabeled data depends on the category of machine learning you're focused on. Labeled data and supervised learning Supervised learning is the most common type of ML algorithm and requires labeled data for training.

From robot assistants to industrial processes powered by automation, this technology has made many jobs and lives easier. One of AI\u2019s major powers is using data to create and train AI algorithms. This means that you can create an AI-based algorithm to process vast amounts of data and turn it into valuable insights. However, that\u2019s only half the battle\u2014to make data actionable, it must be labeled so that the computer can comprehend it. Data labeling is the process of adding tags to your data points to train the Machine Learning algorithm. Yes, Machine Learning is here to automate data processing, but you need to set the rules first. In this guide to data labeling, we\u2019ll look into: Businesses are embracing AI technology to automate processes and capitalize on new business prospects. However, according to McKinsey, data annotation is one of the most difficult barriers to AI adoption in the business. Let\u2019s change that. What is data labeling? Data labeling\u2014or data annotation\u2014refers to the practice of adding tags or labels to raw information such as photographs, videos, text, and audio. These tags describe the data's entity type, referring to various attributes and characteristics of the data point. This allows a Machine Learning model to learn to recognize that type of object when it\u2019s met in data without a label. To train AI and Machine Learning algorithms to understand and learn from your data, you need a well-streamlined and high-quality process of data labeling. Your labeling has to be as precise as possible, whether it's labeled by class, subject, theme, or any other category.

Conversely, poor-quality data can result in models that make inaccurate predictions or exhibit biased behavior. Bias and Fairness The quality of data also impacts the fairness of AI models. Biased or unrepresentative data can lead to models that are unfair to certain groups. For example, if a dataset used to train a facial recognition system predominantly contains images of people from certain racial backgrounds, the system might perform poorly for individuals from underrepresented groups. Ensuring data quality includes addressing biases to create more equitable AI systems. Confidence in Decision Making AI models are increasingly used to support or automate decision-making processes in critical areas such as healthcare, finance, and public safety. The decisions made by these models can have significant implications. High-quality data ensures that the models\u2019 decisions are based on accurate and relevant information, which is essential for building trust and confidence in AI-driven systems. Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness Poor data quality can lead to inefficiencies in the AI development process. Models trained on low-quality data may require more iterations of training and fine-tuning, consuming more time and computational resources. This not only increases the cost of AI projects but can also delay the deployment of AI solutions. Compliance and Ethical Considerations With the growing adoption of AI, there are increasing legal and ethical considerations around the use of data. High-quality data that adheres to privacy regulations and ethical guidelines is crucial for compliance. Poor data practices can lead to violations of laws and ethical standards, resulting in legal pen",

There is an ongoing debate on how and when to label and disclose AI content within SEO. The recent executive order by President Joe Biden, focusing on AI security and safety, has brought renewed attention to the topic. This order, mandating standards for labeling AI-generated content, aims to help verify the authenticity of communications, particularly those appearing to be from the government. A key concern driving this initiative is the potential for AI-generated content to spread false information. But it also highlights the questions of what AI content is, and when it makes sense to label it from an SEO perspective. This task is made more complex by a recent study co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand, which sheds light on public perception and understanding of various terms associated with AI content (from \u201cAI generated\u201d or \u201cAI manipulated\u201d). The study shows that there is not a single term that can cover content produced by/with AI and that there broad cultural difference in the understanding of AI content and the related terms association. I think David Rand's following quote is quite good: Let's start with an example of why this is an essential question for SEOs by looking at some of the backlashes several news sites have experienced when trying to fake real authors when publishing pure AI content. The Sports Illustrated Case: A Spotlight on AI Labeling The recent case involving Sports Illustrated serves as a prime example of how AI labeling has garnered attention. The renowned sports publication found itself in the midst of controversy when it was discovered that certain articles were published under fictitious author names, complete with AI-generated headshots. This revelation was brought to light by Futurism, a news outlet that reported these nonexistent authors' headshots were available for purchase on a website that specializes in ",

The Draft Labelling Method Standard is a mandatory national standard which serves as the supporting and implementing rule of the AI Labelling Measures. Both regulations aim to address deepfake-related risks and ensure the authenticity and credibility of publicly available information.\u00a0 Here are the key points: Our take Aligning with China\u2019s stated commitment to playing a leading role in global AI governance, once adopted, these regulations are designed to enhance the traceability and transparency of AI-generated content, reduce the spread of false or misleading information and better protect the rights of content creators and the general public. We expect that the Draft AI Labelling Measures and the Draft Labelling Method Standard will accelerate the development of AI detection technologies in China. Players operating internationally who are involved in the creation and dissemination of AI generated content now face an increasingly complex web of AI labelling requirements with different application and requirements.

Others, influenced by popular media, view AI as a robot capable of learning anything on its own and completing any task. In reality, AI development requires immense human guidance and effort. AI models must be trained on high-quality data sets prepared after thorough pre-processing. This brings us to our blog\u00e2\u0080\u0099s topic, Data Labeling. Also called Data Annotation, it is a process of applying meaningful labels to data so that the AI model can understand the context. The accuracy of data labels directly impacts the training and outcomes of the AI model. With this blog, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll understand the concept of data labeling, its different types, and the importance of using the right tools including the challenges, best practices, and considerations in choosing these tools. November 7, 2024 Table of Contents What is Data Labeling and Types of Data Labeling in AI The AI development process involves training AI models on preprocessed datasets to ensure the accuracy of their outcomes. Data Labeling (annotation) is an important part of data preprocessing that involves applying meaningful and informative labels to unstructured data. Labels guide models to understand the context, categories, and patterns in data as they learn to make predictions or complete designated tasks. Let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s consider an example of how data labeling is utilized in the healthcare industry. To automate the diagnosis of diseases from medical images, an AI-powered application for medical imaging analysis must be developed. It requires the AI model to be trained on datasets of medical images like X-rays, CT scans, MRI scans, etc. These images must be correctly labeled with the disease names that they help diagnose. For instance, a CT scan showing a brain tumor must be labeled accordingly. So, after the model gets trained on this labeled data it can analyze new, unlabeled medical images and diagnose di",

This study investigates the capabilities of various AI content detection tools in discerning human and AI-authored content. Fifteen paragraphs each from ChatGPT Models 3.5 and 4 on the topic of cooling towers in the engineering process and five human-witten control responses were generated for evaluation. AI content detection tools developed by OpenAI, Writer, Copyleaks, GPTZero, and CrossPlag were used to evaluate these paragraphs. Findings reveal that the AI detection tools were more accurate in identifying content generated by GPT 3.5 than GPT 4. However, when applied to human-written control responses, the tools exhibited inconsistencies, producing false positives and uncertain classifications.

Today, many tasks can be done quickly and efficiently using tools and features created by AI. One of the most important applications that AI utilizes to make things happen is data labeling. Data labeling is the process of assigning labels to data, to train AI models with accuracy. In simple words, data labeling marks every object and element present in a text, video, or image to help AI apprehend and understand what the program is about. This way, the AI model will get better at performing its task.\u00a0 Now, data labeling in traditional times needs to be done manually. This technique is still utilized as it reduces the possibility of errors but it can be very tedious. Using an AI model or feature to perform data labeling is a better option. It saves time to a better extent.\u00a0 There are a number of AI techniques that are being used for data labeling, including: The use of AI for data labeling is still in its early stages, but it is rapidly evolving. As AI technology continues to develop, we can expect to see even more advances in data labeling. When it comes to the future, AI is bound to break boundaries and revolutionize platforms. AI algorithms will become increasingly sophisticated, which is leading to better accuracy and efficiency in data labeling. For example, deep learning algorithms are now being used for tasks that were previously thought to be too difficult for AI, such as image segmentation and natural language translation. The advancement of AI and data labeling would help reduce the one risk many face in this sector. Yes, we are talking about privacy. With better advancements, privacy issues won\u2019t be such a big case for the upcoming time. AI is making it possible to label data more quickly, accurately, and efficiently.

Amid our testing process, two things became apparent: Businesses can maintain the safety and integrity of their online platforms by using a well-rounded approach that utilizes content detectors in tandem with AI-generated content. Table of Contents These tools use advanced algorithms to sift through large amounts of information, identify language patterns, and flag content that meets programmed parameters indicating the use of AI. Although the intention behind these systems is good, they\u2019re not perfect and can create more problems than solutions, often leading to negative consequences. The Rising Prevalence of AI-Generated Marketing Content While the latest iterations of AI might seem like cutting-edge, modern-day marvels, generative AI research actually began in the 1960s. It wasn\u2019t until 2006, however, that generative AI began to develop into the predecessor of its current form, and up until 2014, there were few innovations in the field. In the following years, developments allowed generative AI to advance to where it is today. However, most users weren\u2019t aware of generative AI until the past couple of years, and once the technology was released to the general public, awareness skyrocketed. Consumers were quick to test generative AI technology like text-to-image model services, image-to-image translations, and large language model-based chatbots capable of delivering conversational dialog responses. As more users utilize generative AI tools, there\u2019s been a rising prevalence of AI-generated content.

Where generative AI falls on the synthetic content spectrum AI-generated content is a subset of synthetic content. It includes images, videos, sounds, or any other form generated, edited, or enabled by artificial intelligence. Synthetic content exists on a spectrum with varying degrees of artificiality. One end of the spectrum features raw content, comprising hand-drawn illustrations, unaltered photographs, and human-written texts. These elements are untouched, representing the most natural form of creative expression. Moving along the spectrum is minimally edited content. Subtle refinements characterize this stage, like using Grammarly for text refinement or adjusting image contrast with photo editing apps. These adjustments enhance the quality and clarity of the content while maintaining its original essence. Stepping up from minimally processed content is ultra-processed, where automated methods and software play a more significant role in altering or enhancing human-generated material.

Unlike humans who can learn from a few examples, AI algorithms need thousands or even millions of examples to detect patterns and learn effectively. Any errors, biases, or inconsistencies in the training data labels can significantly impact model performance. Subject matter experts who deeply understand the data are needed for careful labeling. Images, video, audio, and text data often contain nuanced details that generalist labelers could easily mislabel. Domain knowledge is key. For example, doctors should label medical images to accurately distinguish between related diseases or anomalies. Highly skilled linguists or native speakers must label text corpora in order for natural language processing models to learn the rules and cadence of a specific language accurately. Expert labeling early in the data annotation process sets the stage for AI model success. Technology companies building machine learning products invest significant resources into onboarding, training, and quality management to empower data labelers to provide insightful ground truth labels for the algorithms' training. Complex Data Types Necessitate Specialized Labelers Images, video, audio, and text data require different types of expertise for accurate labeling.

While this should help improve transparency, the shift is reshaping content marketing strategies and forcing marketers to take new considerations into account. Below, members of Forbes Agency Council explore different ways this change could impact marketing on LinkedIn and offer practical advice to help marketers adapt their approaches and stay ahead of the curve. 1. AI Will Provide Ideas And Inspiration This is an excellent move by LinkedIn to bring more transparency to the platform. AI should always be used for ideas and inspiration, but not as the final source of content generation. This should inspire marketers to find a direction and plan and write content that resonates with their audience. - Daksh Sharma, Iffort 2. Authenticity Will Be Emphasized Marketers who do the work should appreciate that authenticity matters. If we use AI to do all the work, then we aren\u2019t doing our jobs right. My team uses AI for efficiency, but we don\u2019t use it to replace our brains. We recognize that allowing AI to create content will lead to platforms that do not have real people on them. A premium focus on authenticity is the right approach. It\u2019s a good thing. - Monica Alvarez-Mitchell, Pulse Creative, LLC 3. Lines Will Need To Be Drawn Humanity will benefit when AI- and non-AI-produced content is marked on social networks.

However, the applications of AI are diverse and these companies need to determine where and how AI-powered tools can most add value for them. One area where AI-powered tools have the potential to make a significant, tangible impact is drug labeling. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore the top four benefits of AI-powered drug labeling and how these benefits combat industry challenges. 4 Biggest Benefits AI Brings to Drug Labeling #1 \u2013 AI Ensures Sustained Quality & Compliance One of the biggest challenges in the pharmaceutical label authoring space is ensuring quality and compliance. Since most existing systems and processes cannot easily transform Core Data Sheets (CCDS) to local label formats (USPI, SmPC, etc.), the quality of submission is at risk from manual errors (i.e., incorrectly copying and pasting) and delays. Further, current processes make it difficult for labeling teams and regulatory affairs professionals alike to understand how and why a label was rendered over time; pharmaceutical companies must engage in time-consuming back-and-forth with regulators to identify and validate specific changes within a given label. Similarly, when a label update is required, labeling teams must determine if there are other documents that need to be reviewed and subsequently updated. In the absence of automated change management and branching, identifying all the right documents to update can be difficult. Introducing AI-powered, life sciences-trained tools into the drug labeling process can increase quality and compliance while reducing the time and complexity of curre",

Quick Summary Powered by Addlly AI What is AI-Generated Content? AI-generated content refers to written material produced by artificial intelligence systems, primarily using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning technologies. The concept has its roots dating back to the 1950s when early language models were developed. However, it wasn\u2019t until the 2010s that AI writing capabilities significantly advanced thanks to the rise of large language models like GPT-3 trained on vast datasets from the internet. In 2020, the AI company Anthropic released an AI model called Claude that could generate long-form content like articles and stories. Major tech companies like Google, Meta, and Anthropic have continued pouring resources into refining AI language models. This has led to AI writing tools like Addlly AI and Jasper AI hitting the market, allowing businesses and individuals to generate marketing copy, emails, essays and more via AI. While still an emerging field with limitations, AI-generated content is becoming increasingly prevalent and sophisticated each year. The technology promises increased productivity but has also raised concerns around originality and potential misuse. Pros of AI-Generated Content AI-generated content offer",

Abstract Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines).

Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: (1) communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools) versus (2) diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). Next, we summarize results from two large-scale experiments demonstrating that labeling can, under certain conditions, meaningfully decrease individuals\u2019 likelihood of believing and engaging with misleading, AI-generated images.

One of the drawbacks of the adoption of this technology, however, is that it is becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate human-generated content from synthetic content generated by AI, potentially enabling illegal and harmful conduct. Policymakers around the globe are therefore pondering how to design and implement watermarking techniques to ensure a trustworthy AI environment. China has already taken steps to ban AI-generated images without watermarks. The US administration has been tasked with developing effective labelling and content provenance mechanisms so that end users are able to determine when content is generated using AI and when it is not. The G7 has asked companies to develop and deploy reliable content authentication and provenance mechanisms, such as watermarking, to enable users to identify AI-generated content. The EU's new AI act, provisionally agreed in December 2023, places a number of obligations on providers and users of AI systems to enable the detection and tracing of AI-generated content. Implementation of these obligations will likely require use of watermarking techniques. Current state-of-the-art AI watermarking techniques display strong technical limitations and drawbacks, however, in terms of technical implementation, accuracy and robustness.

This technological advancement has enriched many creative possibilities, boosted workers\u2019 productivity, and offered new tools for innovation. Most output from GenAI systems is beneficial and harmless, but some policymakers are concerned about the technology\u2019s potential misuse, including to spread disinformation through fabricated content, violate IP rights from AI-generated imitations of existing works, and create harmful deepfakes, such as impersonations used to perpetuate fraud or exploitative content such as unauthorized AI-generated nudes of individuals.

Abstract While artificial intelligence technology advances have enabled rapid changes in AI generated content (AIGC) in advertising, little is known about consumer attitudes to AI-generated ads. Drawing on mind perception theory, we argue consumers have different attitudes toward AI-generated ads with agentic and communal appeals. Through four experiments, we show that consumers have more positive attitudes toward AI-generated ads with agentic appeals, and the effect is mediated by task self-efficacy, while they have more positive attitudes toward human-created ads with communal appeals, and the effect is mediated by social self-efficacy. Additionally, we found that assigning a social role to the AI advertising generator, a partner or a servant role, helps mitigate or even reverse the negative effects of AI-generated ads with communal appeals. This study contributes to the literature on AI advertising effectiveness, AI as an information source, and advertising appeals and provides meaningful insights and practical guidelines for a",

Abstract As content generated by artificial intelligence (AI) has become more accessible and higher quality, social debates have intensified. Therefore, this study investigates how people perceive and evaluate AI-generated content and accounts compared to human-created accounts and content. We created Instagram accounts representing AI, influencers, and the public and conducted a user study with 43 participants. The participants had difficulty distinguishing AI accounts from human ones. Moreover, there were significant differences in user perceptions concerning the three account types. Participants perceived the AI and influencer accounts as more attractive than the public account, and they rated the quality of AI-generated content as highly as that created by influencers. These findings suggest that the advancement of generative AI could alter the social media landscape and contribute to discussions on the characteristics and ethical problems of AI-generated content.

Abstract Bottled water has become a popular beverage choice worldwide, with consumers increasingly seeking healthier options. However, label elements can significantly influence consumer perception and purchasing decisions. The research aimed to assess how label elements affect the liking, purchase intention, preference and concept of healthy bottled water.

David Klepper, Associated Press David Klepper, Associated Press Leave your feedback New bipartisan bill would require labeling of AI-generated videos and audio WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Bipartisan legislation introduced in the House Thursday would require the identification and labeling of online\u00a0images, videos and audio\u00a0generated using artificial intelligence, the latest effort to rein in rapidly developing technologies that, if misused, could easily deceive and mislead. So-called deepfakes created by artificial intelligence can be hard or even impossible to tell from the real thing. AI has already been used to mimic\u00a0President Joe Biden\u2019s voice, exploit the likenesses of\u00a0celebrities\u00a0and impersonate\u00a0world leaders, prompting fears it could lead to greater misinformation,\u00a0sexual exploitation, consumer scams and a\u00a0widespread loss of trust. Key provisions in the legislation would require AI developers to identify content created using their products with\u00a0digital watermarks\u00a0or metadata, similar to how photo metadata records the location, time and settings of a picture. Online platforms like TikTok, YouTube or Facebook would then be required to label the content in a way that would notify users. Final details of the proposed rules would be crafted by the\u00a0National Institute of Standards and Technology, a small agency within the U.S. Department of Commerce. Violators of the proposed rule would be subject to civil lawsuits. WATCH: Why more people are tu",

Log In Sign Up Home Opinion Artificial Intelligence The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling of AI-Generated Media by Alex Cooke December 27, 2024 16 Comments Facebook X 16 Comments In the digital age, information flows at speeds and scales that are unprecedented in human history. Social media platforms, digital news outlets, and personal devices collectively serve as both mirrors and engines of cultural discourse. Within this vast ecosystem, a new frontier has emerged: synthetic media or AI-generated media. And with its advanced outpacing our ability to corral its impact, we are headed for trouble. Synthetic media encompasses anything from deepfakes\u2014highly convincing audio-visual fabrications\u2014to seemingly benign AI-driven marketing campaigns. Although synthetic media hold transformative potential for creative expression, storytelling, and other constructive uses, they also possess the capacity to disrupt factual consensus, exploit cognitive biases, and further polarize social and political communities. This risk is compounded by lagging regulations and an under-informed public. Deepfakes, in particular, have transitioned from obscure internet novelty to a major concern for politicians, corporations, and everyday people. These manipulations often appear so authentic that viewers can be easily misled into believing false narratives or malicious content. Beyond the realm of video, AI systems can create deceptive audio and text that masquerade as human-generated. As large language models continue to evolve, the line between human and machine authorship becomes increasingly blurred, raising ethical and legal questions about authenticity, accountability, and transparency.

Our intent has always been to help people know when they see content that was made with AI, and we\u2019ve continued to work with companies across the industry to improve our labeling process so that labels on our platforms are more in line with peoples\u2019 expectations. For content that we detect was only modified or edited by AI tools, we are moving the \u201cAI info\u201d label to the post\u2019s menu. We will still display the \u201cAI info\u201d label for content we detect was generated by an AI tool and share whether the content is labeled because of industry-shared signals or because someone self-disclosed. These changes will begin next week. This slideshow requires JavaScript. Update on July 1, 2024 at 7:00AM PT:\u00a0 We want people to know when they see posts that have been made with AI. Earlier this year, we announced a new approach for labeling AI-generated content. An important part of this approach relies on industry standard indicators that other companies include in content created using their tools, which help us assess whether something is created using AI. Like others across the industry, we\u2019ve found that our labels based on these indicators weren\u2019t always aligned with people\u2019s expectations and didn\u2019t always provide enough context. For example, some content that included minor modifications using AI, such as retouching tools, included industry standard indicators that were then labeled \u201cMade with AI.\u201d While we work with companies across the industry to improve the process so our labeling approach better matches our intent, we\u2019re updating the \u201cMade with AI\u201d label to \u201cAI info\u201d across our apps, which people can click for more information.

There is an ongoing debate on how and when to label and disclose AI content within SEO. The recent executive order by President Joe Biden, focusing on AI security and safety, has brought renewed attention to the topic. This order, mandating standards for labeling AI-generated content, aims to help verify the authenticity of communications, particularly those appearing to be from the government. A key concern driving this initiative is the potential for AI-generated content to spread false information. But it also highlights the questions of what AI content is, and when it makes sense to label it from an SEO perspective. This task is made more complex by a recent study co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand, which sheds light on public perception and understanding of various terms associated with AI content (from \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI generated\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cAI manipulated\u00e2\u0080\u009d). The study shows that there is not a single term that can cover content produced by/with AI and that there broad cultural difference in the understanding of AI content and the related terms association. I think David Rand's following quote is quite good: Let's start with an example of why this is an essential question for SEOs by looking at some of the backlashes several news sites have experienced when trying to fake real authors when publishing pure AI content. The Sports Illustrated Case: A Spotlight on AI Labeling The recent case involving Sports Illustrated serves as a prime example of how AI labeling has garnered attention. The renowned sports publication found itself in the midst of controversy when it was discovered that certain articles were published under fictitious author names, complete with AI-generated headshots. This revelation was brought to light by Futurism, a news outlet that reported these nonexistent authors' headshots were available for purchase on a website that special",

As the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies. People are often coming across AI-generated content for the first time and our users have told us they appreciate transparency around this new technology. So it\u2019s important that we help people know when photorealistic content they\u2019re seeing has been created using AI. We do that by applying \u201cImagined with AI\u201d labels to photorealistic images created using our Meta AI feature, but we want to be able to do this with content created with other companies\u2019 tools too. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been working with industry partners to align on common technical standards that signal when a piece of content has been created using AI. Being able to detect these signals will make it possible for us to label AI-generated images that users post to Facebook, Instagram and Threads. We\u2019re building this capability now, and in the coming months we\u2019ll start applying labels in all languages supported by each app. We\u2019re taking this approach through the next year, during which a number of important elections are taking place around the world.

Meta says it must be labeled Author Dayna Lang Share this Table of Contents AI-generated content to be labeled on Meta going forward Marketers relying on AI-generated content for their social media could find themselves in hot water in 2024. Meta\u2019s top policy executive announced on February 5, 2024, that it will require all users to label AI-generated audio and visual content on its platforms. The social media giant\u2019s long-term goal is to develop technology to detect and label all AI-created content on its platform internally. But, until that technology becomes a reality, it requires users to label the content themselves. Nick Clegg, the company\u2019s president of global affairs, during an interview with Reuters, said: \u201cEven though the technology is not yet fully mature, particularly when it comes to audio and video, the hope is that we can create a sense of momentum and incentive for the rest of the industry to follow.\u201d Clegg did not specify what penalties Meta would implement for violating this policy.

A new study looks at what wording is most effective. MIT IDE Follow MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy -- 12 Listen Share By Brian Eastwood, MIT Sloan In late October, President Joe Biden issued a wide-ranging executive order on AI security and safety. The order includes new standards and best practices for clearly labeling AI-generated content, in part to help Americans determine whether communications that appear to be from the government are authentic. This points to a concern that as generative AI becomes more widely used, manipulated content could easily spread false information. As the executive order indicates, content labels are one strategy for combatting the spread of misinformation. But what are the right terms to use? Which ones will be widely understood by the public as indicating that something has been generated or manipulated by artificial intelligence technology or is intentionally misleading? A new working paper co-authored by MIT Sloan professor David Rand found that across the United States, Mexico, Brazil, India, and China, people associated certain terms, such as \u201cAI generated\u201d and \u201cAI manipulated,\u201d most closely with content created using AI. Conversely, the labels \u201cdeepfake\u201d and \u201cmanipulated\u201d were most associated with misleading content, whether AI created it or not. These results show that most people have a reasonable understanding of what AI means, which is a good starting point. They also suggest that any effort to label content needs to consider the overarching goal, said Rand, a professor of management science and brain and cognitive sciences. Rand co-authored the paper with Ziv Epstein, a postdoctoral fellow at Stanford; MIT graduate researcher Cathy Fang; and Antonio A. Arechar, a professor at the Center for Research and Teaching in Economics in Aguascalientes, Mexico. \u201cA lot of AI-generated content is not misleading, and a lot of misleadin",

Abstract Labeling is a commonly proposed strategy for reducing the risks of generative artificial intelligence (AI). This approach involves applying visible content warnings to alert users to the presence of AI-generated media online (e.g., on social media, news sites, or search engines). Although there is little direct evidence regarding the effectiveness of labeling AI-generated media, a large volume of academic work suggests that warning labels can substantially reduce people\u2019s belief in and sharing of content debunked by professional fact-checkers. Thus, there is reason to believe that labeling could help inform members of the public about AI-generated media. In this paper, we provide a framework for helping policymakers, platforms, and practitioners weigh various factors related to the labeling of AI-generated content online. First, we argue that, before developing labeling programs and policies related to generative AI, stakeholders must establish the objective(s) that labeling is intended to accomplish. Here, we distinguish two such goals: (1) communicating to viewers the process by which a given piece of content was created or edited (i.e., with or without using generative AI tools) versus (2) diminishing the likelihood that content misleads or deceives its viewers (a result that does not necessarily depend on whether the content was created using AI). Next, we summarize results from two large-scale experiments demonstrating that labeling can, under certain conditions, meaningfully decrease individuals\u2019 likelihood of believing and engaging with misleading, AI-generated images. Finally, we highlight several important issues and challenges that must be considered wh",

The results show that stronger transparency enhances firm value, and market competition has a significantly positive effect on that relationship. More importantly, we use hierarchical linear models further to explore the cross-level interaction impact of market competition, and we find evidence suggesting that the industry-level competition has a significant cross-level moderating effect. Additionally, consistent with the substitute perspective, we also find that the disciplinary power of competition on the relationship between transparency and value is more pronounced for firms with weak corporate governance. Overall, our evidence supports the \u201cbright side\u201d of the competition view and highlights the active external governance role that competition plays in the value promotion effect of corporate transparency at both the individual and the industry levels.

This is welfare improving for all consumers and total surplus increases. Introduction The effect of market transparency is an old issue in the competition policy debate. More transparency on the consumer side, so consumers are better informed about prices and product characteristics, are usually thought to promote competition, whereas more transparency on the producer side are thought to have opposite effects as it facilitates tacit collusion, see K\u00fchn and Vives (1995); Stigler (1964) or Tirole (1988). This paper considers the effects on product differentiation and competition of increased transparency on the consumer side in a Hotelling market ala d'Aspremont et al. (1978). Increasing consumers' information about prices and product characteristics makes the market more competitive so equilibrium prices decrease for given product characteristics. The business stealing effect becomes more important for the firms. However, as is well known, when firms locate endogenously, they have an incentive to move apart in order to mitigate competition. This raises the issue how increased market transparency affects product differentiation. If firms react by differentiating their products further, then the competitive effects may vanish.

The rapid advancement of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing content creation, but it\u2019s also raising complex legal questions. As AI-generated content becomes more prevalent, intellectual property owners, creators, and their representatives must navigate an ever-evolving legal landscape to protect their rights and stay ahead of emerging challenges. Whose Copyright Is It? Traditional copyright law is built on the principle that only works created by humans are protected. However, generative AI blurs this line by producing original content autonomously. This raises the question: can AI-generated works be copyrighted, and if so, who owns them\u2014the creator of the AI or the user who initiated the process? Recent Legal Challenges and Lawsuits In 2023 and 2024, several media companies filed lawsuits against OpenAI and others, alleging copyright infringement for using their content to train AI models without permission.

But there are still a lot of legal questions to untangle. Written by Ellen Glover Image: Shutterstock UPDATED BY Matthew Urwin | Sep 18, 2024 At the moment, works created solely by artificial intelligence \u2014 even if produced from a text prompt written by a human \u2014 are not protected by copyright. When it comes to training AI models, however, the use of copyrighted materials is fair game. That\u2019s because of a fair use law that permits the use of copyrighted material under certain conditions without needing the permission of the owner. But pending lawsuits could change this. What Is AI-Generated Content? AI-generated content refers to written text, video, code, audio and other media produced by generative AI tools. These machines are trained on large amounts of data, allowing them to create relevant outputs in response to a word, phrase, question or other kind of input. Generative AI has significantly altered the way we live, work and create in a short amount of time. As a result, the deluge of AI-generated text, images and music \u2014 and the process used to create them \u2014 has prompted a series of complicated legal questions. And they are challenging our understanding of ownership,\u00a0fairness and the very nature of creativity itself. Related Reading4 Ethical Questions Generative AI Poses Can AI Art Be Copyrighted? It has long been the posture of the U.S. Copyright Office that there is no copyright protection for works created by non-humans, including machines.

They need to be democratized to do so, writes Claire Leibowicz, head of AI and Media Integrity at the Partnership on AI. A July 14, 2024 White House address by President Joe Biden was manipulated and posted to X by the operator of a meme account. When President Joe Biden announced that he was ending his campaign for re-election with a letter posted on X, conspiracy theories about the authenticity of his signature swirled. The next day, a deepfake depicting Biden cursing about his opponents, alongside a fake PBS NewsHour label, circulated widely. Commenters on X questioned the artifact\u2019s authenticity. PBS, posting from its official channels, helped alleviate the uncertainty, clarifying that the broadcaster does \u201cnot condone altering news video or audio in any way that could mislead the audience.\u201d Manipulating videos and casting doubt on real content are not new phenomena. Yet AI technologies have made it easier to mislead, amplifying existing challenges to trust and truth. AI not only provides cheap and accessible tools for creating realistic content (like the PBS deepfake), but also bolsters plausibility for those looking to cast doubt on real artifacts by claiming they are made with AI (like the letter). In response, policymakers from Sacramento to Brussels have begun to take action. Many rightfully seek to bolster AI transparency, often by proposing labels that convey to users whether a piece of content is AI-generated or modified. They believe that by disclosing that, say, a Biden deepfake was made using AI, audiences will doubt misleading content. As the Federal Communications Commission summed up in its new proposal for disclosing AI-generated political content, \u201cVoters deserve to know if the voices and images in political commercials are authentic or if they have been manipulated.\u201d But policymakers and practitioners must consider: What do audiences deserve to know? And how, an",

With PAI, we provide guidance for labelling them. By Emily Saltz, Tommy Shane, Victoria Kwan, Claire Leibowicz, Claire Wardle. This post has been republished with permission by the Partnership on AI. The original post was published on Medium. Manipulated photos and videos flood our fragmented, polluted, and increasingly automated information ecosystem, from a synthetically generated \u201cdeepfake,\u201d to the far more common problem of older images resurfacing and being shared with a different context. While research is still limited, there is some empirical support to show visuals tend to be both\u00a0more memorable\u00a0and\u00a0more widely shared than text-only posts, heightening their potential to cause real-world harm, at scale. Consider the numerous audiovisual examples in this running list of hoaxes and misleading posts\u00a0about police brutality protests in the United States. In response, what should social media platforms do? Twitter, Facebook, and others have been working on new ways to identify and label manipulated media. Label designs aren\u2019t applied in a vacuum, as the divisive reactions to Twitter\u2019s recent decision to label two of Trump\u2019s misleading and incendiary tweets demonstrate. In one instance, the platform appended a label under a tweet that contained incorrect information about California\u2019s absentee ballot process, encouraging readers to click through and \u201cGet the facts about mail-in ballots.\u201d In the other instance, Twitter replaced the text of\u00a0a tweet referring to shooting of looters with a label that says: \u201cThis tweet violates the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence.\u201d Twitter determined that it was in the public interest for the tweet to remain accessible and this label allowed users the opti",

By Kristin M. Lord & Katya Vogt Mar. 18, 2021 The deliberate or unintentional spread of misinformation, despite capturing widespread public attention, remains as rampant as ever, showing up recently in the form of false claims about COVID-19 vaccines, the Capitol riot, and many other topics. This \u201cinfodemic\u201d is polarizing politics, endangering communities, weakening institutions, and leaving people unsure what to believe or whom to trust. It threatens the foundations of democratic governance, social cohesion, national security, and public health. Misinformation is a long-term problem that demands long-term, sustainable solutions as well as short-term interventions. We've seen a number of quicker, technological fixes that improve the social media platforms that supply information. Companies like Facebook and Twitter, for example, have adjusted their algorithms or called out problematic content. We've also seen slower, human-centered approaches that make people smarter about the media they demand to access online. Evidence-driven educational programs, for instance, have made people better at discerning the reliability of information sources, distinguishing facts from opinions, resisting emotional manipulation, and being good digital citizens. It hasn't been enough. If we're to stop misinformation and its insidious effects, we need to radically expand and accelerate our counterattacks. It will take all sectors of society: business, nonprofits, advocacy organizations, philanthropists, researchers, governments, and more. We also need to balance our efforts. For too long, too many resources and debates have focused on changing the technology, not educating people. This emphasis on the supply side",

We\u2019ve published an account of our findings and a few recommendations on Poynter.org. The post below has slightly more detail on our methodology and a link to our data. To assess how well news organizations are labeling their articles, the Duke Reporters\u2019 Lab examined articles from 49 publications. The study was prompted by the ongoing public debate about declining trust in the news media. Some journalists and educators have said one way to improve trust is for people to better understand the type of content they\u2019re reading. Online journalism provides readers with access to thousands of news sources, but readers may not understand the type of article they\u2019re reading. Our hypothesis was that many news organizations do not label article types to indicate whether they are news, analysis, opinion or a review. Students in the Lab analyzed 49 news organizations \u2014 25 local newspapers and 24 national news and opinion websites. Students collected 25 articles from each organization \u2014 five articles from five different sections of the publication. For each piece of content, they note, among other things, if that article had a label, what the label said, if the label was clearly defined anywhere on the page and the size, location and color of the label. Our findings: * Of the 49 organizations analyzed, the Reporters\u2019 Lab found that only 20 of them \u2014 40 percent \u2014 labeled article type at least once in at least one section of their website. * Of the 20 organizations that did label article types, 16 of them \u2014 80 percent \u2014 only used labels in the opinion section. Those labels included editorial (used on 15 news sites), commentary (seven sites), column or columnist (six sites) and letters (seven s",

Sustained content study is recommended because: it allows students to accrue information, without which they are less able to question, synthesize, and evaluate what they read; it allows students to become familiar with the rhetorical conventions of a discipline; and, as these are the skills needed for university study, today's workplace and to understand the socio-political factors that affect students' lives, sustained study allows students to practice in the ESL class what they will need outside it. This article: defines critical thinking, discusses who should learn it and why, reviews the role of content in ESL and the literature supporting sustained study, and discusses content that engages ESL students with varied majors and goals. Three courses are described, one on selected economic/political issues, one on language acquisition itself, and one on film and society. Selections from student discussion and writing are examined.

Quitadamo (iq@cwu.edu) Corresponding author. Received 2006 Nov 27; Revised 2007 Feb 16; Accepted 2007 Feb 19. Abstract Increasingly, national stakeholders express concern that U.S. college graduates cannot adequately solve problems and think critically. As a set of cognitive abilities, critical thinking skills provide students with tangible academic, personal, and professional benefits that may ultimately address these concerns. As an instructional method, writing has long been perceived as a way to improve critical thinking. In the current study, the researchers compared critical thinking performance of students who experienced a laboratory writing treatment with those who experienced traditional quiz-based laboratory in a general education biology course. The effects of writing were determined within the context of multiple covariables. Results indicated that the writing group significantly improved critical thinking skills whereas the nonwriting group did not. Specifically, analysis and inference skills increased significantly in the writing group but not the nonwriting group. Writing students also showed greater gains in evaluation skills; however, these were not significant. In addition to writing, prior critical thinking skill and instructor significantly affected critical thinking performance, whereas other covariables such as gender, ethnicity, and age were not significant. With improved critical thinking skill, general education biology st",

As a result, critical thinking skill is seen as a significant factor in the educational process. Many academics and researchers have recently conducted studies on the advantages and impacts of critical thinking skills in various fields, the benefits of which have been widely addressed in educational curricula. The aim of this study is to analyze the existing literature related to critical thinking in educational curricula through a systematic literature review. This paper analyses literature through electronic databases obtained primarily from Scopus. 754 publications published between the years 1944 to 2020 were retrieved for further analysis. Various tools were employed, namely Microsoft Excel, VOSviewer, and Harzing's Publish or Perish. The results of this study are presented using common bibliometric indicators like as research productivity in term of publication year, document type, subject area, keywords analysis, authorship, and citation analysis. Overall, the increase in number of works on critical thinking in teaching indicates growing awareness on its importance and specific requirements in the 21 st century learning education.

Critical thinking involves analyzing and evaluating information carefully to make thoughtful, reasoned decisions. Questioning assumptions, recognizing biases, and considering multiple perspectives before reaching conclusions is essential. This approach differs significantly from rote memorization, which is solely about recalling information without questioning its source or context. Instead, critical thinking invites active engagement with content, encouraging learners to interpret, analyze, and apply information to real-world situations. One key benefit of critical thinking is its role in enhancing problem-solving capabilities. By breaking down information into manageable parts, individuals can identify patterns, understand relationships, and evaluate the significance of various elements. For example, when presented with conflicting data, a critical thinker needs to choose more than one source but assesse",

Abstract With the large amount of news currently being published online, the ability to evaluate the credibility of online news has become essential. While there are many studies involving fake news and tools on how to detect it, there is a limited amount of work that focuses on the use of information literacy to assist people to critically access online information and news. Critical thinking, as a form of information literacy, provides a means to critically engage with online content, for example by looking for evidence to support claims and by evaluating the plausibility of arguments. The purpose of this study is to investigate the current state of knowledge on the use of critical thinking to identify fake news. A systematic literature review (SLR) has been performed to identify previous studies on evaluating the credibility of news, and in particular to see what has been done in terms of the use of critical thinking to evaluate online news. During the SLR\u2019s sifting process, 22 relevant studies were identified. Although some of these studies referred to information literacy, only three explicitly dealt with critical thinking as a means to identify fake news. The stud",

However, this study demonstrates that the relationship between critical thinking and information literacy is not obvious, and relatively little has been recently studied regarding how academic librarians incorporate critical thinking into their library instruction. Through a series of in-depth interviews, the researchers sought to understand how academic librarians who primarily instruct first-year college students conceive of, teach, and assess critical thinking skills in relation to information literacy. Introduction Critical thinking, while often used as a buzzword, is clearly relevant to the mission and expertise of librarians who teach, as well as the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy.1 Especially now, as students encounter misinformation, as well as ra",

Despite popular opinion regarding the devastating impact of the Internet on the modern age, the inherent untrustworthiness of information is not new. Satire, misinformation, and disinformation have been circulating for centuries, even long before the printed word. However, thanks to the relative ease of creating and sharing content online, our students are confronted with publications created solely to entertain, persuade, and incite via incorrect or incomplete statistics. Meanwhile, rapidly advancing technology provides novice researchers with immediate access to overwhelming numbers of resources, and the traditional steps of the research process\u2013such as resource evaluation\u2013have seemingly fallen to the wayside in deference to instant gratification and confirmation bias. Students diving into the world of academic and professional-level research often have no awareness of the gaps in their understanding when it comes to performing critical, thoughtful research. As educators, we must spare the time and effort required to help fill in these gaps and provide students with a workable set of skills to address this lack of critical thinking in the research process. Beyond the potential lack of credibility of information resources, students also struggle with other steps of research performance such as locating viable resources in a timely manner, accurately determining the relevance of found information to their topics, and applying the information to their assignment in a way that is both informative and useful. Each of these steps of the research process require not only a deeper understanding of how research should be performed but also a toolbox of critical thinking skills that students can use to overcome potential obstacles.

Lee, C. So Abstract In knowledge society, there is currently a call for cultivating a combination of media literacy and information literacy. This, however, requires cooperation from these two separate fields of study, and uncertainty regarding their boundaries hinders a smooth merger. It is unclear whether they are subsets of each other or separate entities. In this study, we have explored the relationship between these two fields by empirically mapping out their territories and discussing their similarities and differences. We have made use of the Web of Science database to delineate the content and boundary of these two fields. Our findings from 1956 to 2012 show that the two fields have different authors, university affiliations, and journals; they also differ in terms of academic origin, scope, and social concern. Information literacy has a closer tie to library science, while media literacy is more related to media content, media industry, and social effects. Due to their different academic orientations, the two fields adopt different analytical approaches. We have found that media literacy is not a subset of information literacy as some scholars have suggested, although the two fields have similarities. They share the same goal, and their publications overlap in terms of subject areas, countries of origin, and titles. The two fields could find common ground by cooperating together to contribute to the promotion of new literacy in knowledge societies.

They need to be democratized to do so, writes Claire Leibowicz, head of AI and Media Integrity at the Partnership on AI. A July 14, 2024 White House address by President Joe Biden was manipulated and posted to X by the operator of a meme account. When President Joe Biden announced that he was ending his campaign for re-election with a letter posted on X, conspiracy theories about the authenticity of his signature swirled. The next day, a deepfake depicting Biden cursing about his opponents, alongside a fake PBS NewsHour label, circulated widely. Commenters on X questioned the artifact\u2019s authenticity. PBS, posting from its official channels, helped alleviate the uncertainty, clarifying that the broadcaster does \u201cnot condone altering news video or audio in any way that could mislead the audience.\u201d Manipulating videos and casting doubt on real content are not new phenomena. Yet AI technologies have made it easier to mislead, amplifying existing challenges to trust and truth. AI not only provides cheap and accessible tools for creating realistic content (like the PBS deepfake), but also bolsters plausibility for those looking to cast doubt on real artifacts by claiming they are made with AI (like the letter). In response, policymakers from Sacramento to Brussels have begun to take action. Many rightfully seek to bolster AI transparency, often by proposing labels that convey to users whether a piece of content is AI-generated or modified. They believe that by disclosing that, say, a Biden deepfake was made using AI, audiences will doubt misleading content. As the Federal Communications Commission summed up in its new proposal for disclosing AI-generated political content, \u201cVoters deserve to know if the voices and images in political commercials are authentic or if they have been manipulated.\u201d But policymakers and practitioners must consider: What do audiences deserve to know?

To read the first part, click here. Media Literacy As discussed in our policy framework section, our last disinformation policy category is Media Literacy. Media Literacy is a broad category that can include initiatives to educate citizens on identifying disinformation, promoting critical information practices, or fact-checking and flagging disinformation. This category encompasses a range of measures, such as videos that teach school children how to find trusted information sources, some forms of content moderation, and flagging content for users to make them more aware of disinformation. Though the boundary between different disinformation policy categories can be fuzzy, the critical distinction for media literacy is that the policy is focused on consumers of information (or disinformation), with policies aiming to educate the consumers and shore up their defenses\u2014that is, to increase their resilience against\u2014disinformation campaigns. Positive content moderation can be considered both a content moderation and media literacy disinformation policy and illustrates how boundaries overlap. As discussed in our content moderation section, positive content moderation is the promotion or dissemination of certain content, for example, Meta flagging COVID-19-related content on its platforms and attaching links to the Center for Disease Control\u2019s website to provide accurate information in real time and actively mitigate pandemic disinformation",

Manipulated photos and videos flood our fragmented, polluted, and increasingly automated information ecosystem, from a synthetically generated \u201cdeepfake,\u201d to the far more common problem of older images resurfacing and being shared with a different context. While research is still limited, there is some empirical support to show visuals tend to be both\u00a0more memorable\u00a0and\u00a0more widely shared\u00a0than text-only posts, heightening their potential to cause real-world harm, at scale\u2014just consider the numerous audiovisual examples in\u00a0this running list of hoaxes and misleading posts\u00a0about police brutality protests in the United States.

While muckraking in politics and other such biased and editorial takes on the news are not new, the 24/7 firehose of content to be consumed across all media platforms is. And the good and the bad of it all is that anyone can be a content creator these days, but content or \u201cnews\u201d is not necessarily unbiased, objective, or based on research. What is news literacy? News literacy is an aspect of media literacy that aims to teach consumers to be thoughtful about the content they are seeking out, digesting, internalizing, and sharing, whether from online or more traditional media. Examples of news literacy can be woven across the curriculum, as news literacy consists of the critical thinking skills that help us determine fact from fiction, bias from fairness, and opinion from news. \u201c\u200b\u200bMedia literacy is critical to the survival and perpetuation of a healthy democracy.\u201d \u2013 Columnist Janice Ellis, Missouri Independent *Why is news literacy important for students to learn?* The evaluation skills core of news literacy helps readers determine the credibility, validity, and reliability of news sources and newer sources of information.

Internet-based technologies and products have unleashed exponential economic growth and efficiencies. It is no accident that the five largest companies in the S&P 500 are Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, NVDIA and Alphabet (Google). Certainly the internet has been, and will continue to be, a driver of economic growth and internet-based innovations that promise to continue to improve the health, education and economic opportunities for all of us. However, as has been true with all new technological innovations, there is a dark side to the internet; challenges that if ignored, will substantially reduce the benefits expected to be realized from universal access to broadband and its applications. These challenges need to be understood and addressed, particularly as we work to connect the remainder of homes and businesses in the United States to broadband by 2030.

Librarians often deliver information literacy instruction to students through online learning objects, like tutorials. If librarians value critical thinking as a component of their teaching, it is important that these tools solicit critical thinking in their users. This study uses a thorough literature review to develop a set of best practices for teaching and assessing critical thinking through online learning objects. Those best practices inform a rubric that can be used to evaluate how much an information literacy online learning object is following best practices for teaching and assessing critical thinking. Introduction Many would agree that critical thinking should be an essential outcome of a college education. A 2006 report made by a collection of United States organizations found that employers rate \u201ccritical thinking\u201d as the most highly desired skill of recent graduates (Casner-Lotto & Barrington). At the same time, over 90% of the surveyed employers found college graduates to be \u201cdeficient\u201d in critical thinking skills (Casner-Lotto & Barrington, 2006). While the importance of critical thinking is very infrequently disputed, the evidence suggests that i",

My main finding is that regular social media use trains people to rely too heavily on heuristic or Fast Thinking, leaving them vulnerable to a further 5 psychological flaws that naturally reside in our evolutionary makeup... Nick Smallman 19th October 2022 Introduction In his 2011 book, Thinking, Fast and Slow, Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman examines two modes of thought: Fast or Heuristic Thinking helps the brain to save time, where responses are fast, impulsive and automatic, applying to most of our decisions on a day-to-day basis. Slow Thinking is where our responses are considered, thoughtful and deliberate. These take more time and energy but benefit from detailed evaluation by the mind and so are more reliable. Slow thinking looks at the bigger picture and tends to overrule the temptation to give fast and impulsive responses. Why Fast Thinking is the gateway to inferior critical thinking As we know, the brain can learn new behaviours and habits because it possesses neuroplasticity. These changes happen because neural pathways make new connections via: \u2022 environmental factors \u2022 repetition \u2022 psychological stress. Social media provides fertile ground for radical changes in the way engaged users think by degrading their thinking process. My main finding is that regular social media use trains people to rely too heavily on heuristic or Fast Thinking, leaving them vulnerable to a further 5 psychological flaws (see below) that naturally reside in our evolutionary makeup. If not fully understood, these flaws can lead to poor decision making, degraded empathy for outgroups and low mental health outcomes: The 5 Psychological Flaws These 5 flaws make us think we have more power than we really do.

In 2005, Facebook had around 5 million active users. As of 2020, more than 2.7 billion use the platform actively. Social media has inserted itself into almost every facet of human life. People use it to maintain relationships with family and friends, to share information on the tiniest aspects of daily life, such as the length of the grass in their lawn, and to get informed about what\u2019s going on in the world. Simply put, the adoption of social media is one of the most widespread and rapid changes in communications in human history. It shouldn\u2019t be surprising, therefore, that it has come along with a number of drawbacks and challenges \u2014 not least of all to the way we think. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated our use of social media, of course, making us far more likely to be on Twitter or Facebook. The pandemic has also exacerbated some of the challenges that come with social media, particularly around critical thinking and disinformation. For these reasons, in our annual survey on the state of critical thinking, the Reboot Foundation asked people about their use of and views on social media, particularly as it related to their mental health.

One widely adopted intervention by platforms for addressing falsehoods is applying \u201cwarning labels\u201d to posts deemed inaccurate by fact-checkers. Despite a rich literature on correcting misinformation after exposure, much less work has examined the effectiveness of warning labels presented concurrent with exposure. Promisingly, existing research suggests that warning labels effectively reduce belief and spread of misinformation. The size of these beneficial effects depends on how the labels are implemented and the characteristics of the content being labeled. Despite some individual differences, recent evidence indicates that warning labels are generally effective across party lines and other demographic characteristics. We discuss potential implications and limitations of labeling policies for addressing online misinformation. Section snippets Warning labels generally reduce belief and sharing of falsehoods Retrospective self-report data from October 2021 indicate that the majority of Americans (57\u00a0%) recalled seeing a social media post with a warning label attached \u2013 however, they were evenly split on whether or not they thought that the warning label made them less likely to trust the contents of the post [9].

Civic Signal Being Amplified When To Use It What Is Its Intended Impact Reduce belief in and willingness to spread misleading or false content. Evidence That It Works Evidence That It Works Across a number of survey experiment studies, researchers find that labeling misleading content with warnings based on professional fact-checkers' evaluations - for example \u00e2\u0080\u009cDisputed,\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u009cRated false,\u00e2\u0080\u009d or \u00e2\u0080\u009cFalse information checked by independent fact-checkers\u00e2\u0080\u009d - can reduce participants belief in false news or their reported willingness to share misinformation. One study, discussed below, finds similar results for content marked as false by community members. Labels, however, should be used carefully as several studies suggest they have the potential to backfire. One survey experiment (Mena, 2020) tests if Facebook users are more likely to say they would share news stories depending on whether a story is flagged as disputed by professional fact checkers. Participants observed a Facebook post containing false news content with or without a warning label (\u00e2\u0080\u009cDisputed by Snopes.com and PolitiFact\u00e2\u0080\u009d). Respondents who observed the label on top of the post had significantly lower intentions to share the deceiving information on social media than respondents who did not see the label (Cohen\u00e2\u0080\u0099s d = \u00e2\u0088\u00920.36). (Note: we report effect sizes using the metrics in the authors' paper. All effects we include are statistically significant, unless otherwise stated.) Several studies show similar positive effects on how much subjects believe false information when it is flagged based on professional fact checker ratings. For example, in Clayton et al. (2020) participants observed a replica of a Facebook newsfeed containing false and true news stories, with warnings attached to the misleading posts.

MIT News | Massachusetts Institute of Technology Browse By Topics Departments Centers, Labs, & Programs Schools The catch to putting warning labels on fake news Press Contact: Previous image Next image After the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Facebook began putting warning tags on news stories fact-checkers judged to be false. But there\u2019s a catch: Tagging some stories as false makes readers more willing to believe other stories and share them with friends, even if those additional, untagged stories also turn out to be false. That is the main finding of a new study co-authored by an MIT professor, based on multiple experiments with news consumers. The researchers call this unintended consequence \u2014 in which the selective labeling of false news makes other news stories seem more legitimate \u2014 the \u201cimplied-truth effect\u201d in news consumption. \u201cPutting a warning on some content is going to make you think, to some extent, that all of the other content without the warning might have been checked and verified,\u201d says David Rand, the Erwin H. Schell Professor at the MIT Sloan School of Management and co-author of a newly published paper detailing the study. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the fact-checkers can keep up with the stream of misinformation, so even if the warnings do really reduce belief in the tagged stories, you still have a problem, because of the implied truth effect,\u201d Rand adds. Moreover, Rand observes, the implied truth effect \u201cis actually perfectly rational\u201d on the part of readers, since there is ambiguity about whether untagged stories were verified or just not yet checked. \u201cThat makes these warnings potentially problematic,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause people will reasonably make this inference.\u201d Even so, the findings also suggest a solution: Placing \u201cVerified\u201d tags on stories found to be true eliminates the problem.

However, venturing into the world of white labeling requires attention to various legal considerations and compliance requirements. This comprehensive guide aims to shed light on the aspects associated with white labeling, offering valuable insights to assist businesses in successfully navigating this space. Grasping the Concept of White Labeling Before delving into the dimensions, it is essential to have an understanding of what white label products and white labeling entail. White labeling involves taking a product or service developed by one company and rebranding it under another company\u2019s name. This enables the latter company to sell the product as its own without having to invest in its development. Protecting Intellectual Property Rights One crucial aspect of white labeling is ensuring that all necessary intellectual property rights are appropriately obtained. This includes securing trademarks, copyrights, and patents associated with the product being labeled under a brand. Failing to secure these rights can have repercussions down the line, potentially leading to cease and desist orders or expensive lawsuits. It is imperative for businesses engaged in white labeling to thoroughly research and acquire all IP rights before proceeding. Quality Control Maintaining consistent quality standards is crucial for the success of white labeling operations. It is essential for companies to collaborate closely with their suppliers or partners to establish guidelines for quality control that align with their brand values and meet customer expectations. Regular inspections and audits play a role in ensuring that these standards are upheld throughout the supply chain. Without quality control measures in place, businesses run the risk of dama",

Although registration is not required, there are benefits to registering copyright, particularly for artistic designs that are used often and have a monetary benefit. Copyright registration provides public notice of the copyright and also may be used as evidence that you are the rightful owner of the artistic design. Learn more about Copyright registration. Trademarks A stronger form of intellectual property for business owners to protect product labels is Trademarks. Trademarks are the brand names, logos and slogans used by your business to distinguish your products from others in the marketplace. Over time, use of trademarks may provide you with unregistered rights in the marks in the geographical area that you use them. However, Trademark Registration provides many benefits including registered protection across Canada for 10 years, proof of your ownership of the mark, and deters copyrights.

However, developing those ideas and carrying them to fruition takes a lot of work, time, and investment. Every phase of development brings the risk of the unknown. That\u2019s why intellectual property laws are in place to protect Americans, ensuring their valuable work is protected every step of the way from concept to completion. What Is Intellectual Property? Intellectual property (IP) protects the work of inventors, artists, writers, and creators, as well as the reputation of individuals, brands, and companies. This type of property refers to creations of the mind and can be claimed similarly to physical property, providing important rights and protections. By establishing rightful ownership, you give yourself control over how your IP is used. Intellectual Property Rights and How They Work IP rights guard your ideas against theft, unauthorized use, or forced surrender to competitors. Otherwise, your idea might be copied by someone else just when you had done all the work! However, businesses and individuals must utilize the appropriate type of right to protect their IP from misuse or even theft. Various forms of IP are protected by law through patents, copyright, trademarks, and trade secrets. The\u00a0four formal types of intellectual property\u00a0are: These rights protect more than individual concepts \u2014 they safeguard all American ingenuity. Property rights in ideas enable Americans to invest in themselves and to collaborate with others. By creating a legal foundation for people to enter contracts, share knowledge, and work together for everyone\u2019s best interests while protecting the rights of each party, IP reduces \"idea hoarding\u201d and fosters collaboration. IP rights also create prosperity, accounting for more than 40% of the U.S. economy. Effective Policy Matters Government policies play a significant rol",

One powerful way to achieve this is through personalized labels. Here at Name Bubbles, a company specializing in personalized name labels for kids, we understand the significance of these labels beyond their practicality. We recognize the psychological impact personalized labels can have on a child's self-esteem and uniqueness. As a brand that caters to families and children, part of our marketing strategy is to boost positive feelings and have a positive influence on your children in fostering independence and responsibility. In this blog post, we delve into the psychology behind personalized labels and explore how they can boost kids' confidence and individuality. Creating a Sense of Ownership: Personalized labels provide children with a sense of ownership and belonging. By affixing their names to their belongings, kids feel a strong connection to their possessions. This connection fosters a sense of responsibility, encouraging children to take ownership of their belongings and reinforcing the idea that they are unique individuals with distinct identities. It also promotes responsibility by giving them the task to label their items and keep track of them when returning from school. When ownership and responsibility are combined, independence will start to foster in your children, and you will be able to see the power of ownership at a young age.\u00a0 Building Self-Identity: As your child enters school and begins to develop a sense of self, being able to label with designs they have created and chosen themselves allows them to find out what colors and styles they are drawn to and build onto figuring out their identit",

Registering a trademark involves conducting a thorough search to ensure the chosen mark is not already in use, then filing an application with the USPTO. To avoid trademark infringement, it's important to conduct a comprehensive search before adopting a new mark and to monitor the marketplace for potential conflicts. Copyright law protects original works of authorship, including artistic and design elements of a product. When labeling products, it's important to include trademark symbols (\u2122 or \u00ae) for registered marks and to properly attribute copyrighted elements to the original creator. Understanding Trademark Law Trademarks are an essential component of any successful product design. They serve as a unique identifier, allowing consumers to recognize and distinguish your brand from competitors. Understanding the fundamentals of trademark law is crucial for entrepreneurs and small business owners looking to protect their product designs. Trademarks are defined as any word, symbol, or combination thereof that identifies and distinguishes the source of goods or services. The primary purpose of trademark law is to prevent consumer confusion and protect the goodwill associated with a particular brand. By registering a trademark, you can establish exclusive rights to use that mark in connection with your products or services, ensuring that your brand stands out in the marketplace. The importance of trademarks for product designs cannot be overstated. A strong, distinctive trademark can help your products gain recognition, build brand loyalty, and deter competitors from using confusingly similar designs. While common law trade",

Whether it\u2019s the recipe to Coca-Cola, the product schematics to an Intel microchip, or the latest Hollywood blockbuster, intellectual property (IP) ensures the products and services we use are authentic, approved, and safe. It\u2019s no surprise therefore that intellectual property owners\u2014the creators and innovators\u2014should be able to protect what has likely taken years to build, test, and release. Without these protections, innovation could be stifled and financial losses could ensue. In this article, we will explore the importance of intellectual property in various contexts, including entrepreneurship, mergers and acquisitions, licensing, and compliance with regulatory frameworks. Additionally, we will delve into the types of intellectual property rights and the consequences of infringement. What Is Intellectual Property? Intellectual property refers to any creation or invention of the human intellect that entitles the creator to certain exclusivity rights, preventing others from using or replicating the property without the owner\u2019s consent. Examples of intellectual property include patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secrets. Importance of Intellectual Property Protecting intellectual property is essential to ensuring IP creators and owners receive appropriate compensation for their work. Without IP protection, others would be free to use or replicate inventions or creations without the owner\u2019s consent, which could result in significant financial losses and undermine innovation. Types of Intellectual Property There are several types of intellectual property, each with its own form of protection.

It consists of inventions, literary and artistic works, symbols, images, names, designs used in commerce and original expressions of creative individuals. The key forms of intellectual property protection are patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets. Because intellectual property shares many of the characteristics of real and personal property, associated rights permit intellectual property to be treated as an asset that can be bought, sold, licensed or given away. Intellectual property laws enable owners, inventors and creators to protect their property from unauthorized use. Inventors, artists and authors \u2014 whose work is intangible \u2014 face difficulty in earning a living if their claim to their creations is not respected. Unable to rely on locks and fences to protect their work, they turn to intellectual property protection laws. WHY DO COUNTRIES PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY? Countries know that safeguarding intellectual property rights fosters economic growth, provides incentives for technological innovation, and attracts investment that will create jobs and opportunities for all their citizens. Intellectual property protections are also critical to consumers. Most advances in t",

In the past, U.S. law required creators to label their works in certain ways or to register their creations with the U.S. Copyright Office to benefit from copyright protections. In 1976, U.S. law changed to be consistent with international standards so that creators have copyright protection immediately upon creation. U.S. copyright law is intended to encourage people to create new works. By limiting how others can use a newly-created work for some period of time, copyright law gives creators more control over the use of their works and increases",

If everything I created is protected by the copyright; No one can use it without my permission. Why would I need to register it as a trademark to protect it? If something is too simple to create, it cannot be registered as a trademark, it's the same as how copyright works. Therefore, if my logo (not logotype) can be registered as a trademark, then I have the copyright of my logo. So, what's the point to make a logo as a trademark? Only because trademark can be owned by a company not just a person? 4 Answers 4 Copyrights protect the mark as is, and derivatives of it, but does not protect the brand from look a likes or from new trademarks that would be confusing. Consider the Pepsi logo: I could easily draw a circle half red and half blue with a white line straight across, vertically, or diagonally. In fact: \u00a9 2018 A. K. all rights reserved. There it is my new logo for my cola company called Hep-C (I'm raising awareness). Under copyright law Pepsi could not come after me because the logo is my own creation. I could even call it Pepsi and it would not be a copyright violation as you cannot copyright words. However, Pepsi has better lawyers than that and with my trademark so similar to theirs and the name sounding so similar (and my new name being potentially disparaging to Pepsi) it would likely confuse consumers between what was Pepsi and what was Hep-C thus under trademark law it would be disallowed for commerc",

To be copyrightable, a work must qualify as an original work of authorship, meaning that it must have been created independently and contain a sufficient amount of creativity. Most works meet these conditions. Some works, however, contain elements that either lack the required creativ - ity or are placed outside the bounds of copyright by the law. This circular highlights different types of noncopyrightable subject matter.

However, copyright protection will extend only to the origi - nal expression in that work and not to the underlying idea, methods, or systems described or explained. Inventions You can register a technical drawing or a written description of an invention when the drawing or description contains a sufficient amount of authorship. However, the registration extends only to the original expression contained in the drawing or description and does not apply to the underlying invention. Inventions meeting certain requirements may be patentable. For information about patent laws, visit the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office website or call 1-800-786-9199.

It usually identifies the product and acknowledges its unchanged quality and helps to advertise the product. (Please refer to\u00a0 Section 11(6) and 11(7) of\u00a0 The Trademarks Act.) \r A logotype, commonly referred to as a logo, is a graphical symbol created for an individual company or product.

Registering a trademark involves conducting a thorough search to ensure the chosen mark is not already in use, then filing an application with the USPTO. To avoid trademark infringement, it's important to conduct a comprehensive search before adopting a new mark and to monitor the marketplace for potential conflicts. Copyright law protects original works of authorship, including artistic and design elements of a product. When labeling products, it's important to include trademark symbols (\u2122 or \u00ae) for registered marks and to properly attribute copyrighted elements to the original creator. Understanding Trademark Law Trademarks are an essential component of any successful product design. They serve as a unique identifier, allowing consumers to recognize and distinguish your brand from competitors. Understanding the fundamentals of trademark law is crucial for entrepreneurs and small business owners looking to protect their product designs. Trademarks are defined as any word, symbol, or combination thereof that identifies and distinguishes the source of goods or services. The primary purpose of trademark law is to prevent consumer confusion and protect the goodwill associated with a particular brand. By registering a trademark, you can establish exclusive rights to use that mark in connection with your products or services, ensuring that your brand stands out in the marketplace. The importance of trademarks for product designs cannot be overstated. A strong, distinctive trademark can help your products gain recognition, build brand loyalty, and deter competitors from using confusingly similar designs. While common law trade",

People are constantly asking why they've had listings removed and/or suspended off the platform. Why? IP Infringement. What is IP Infringement? Intellectual Property Infringement is when you are using someone else's creation (intellectual property) to make a product that sells and benefits you. Straight from Wikipedia: \"There are several types of intellectual property rights, such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, industrial designs, and trade secrets.\" Why is this so bad? It's someone else's creation!! Just because you bought supplies to print stickers, create SVG files, make tee shirts, resin print, and so on, doesn't mean you get to print anything and everything. If it is an existing character or entity (ie Disney, Marvel, DC, Harry Potter, Nintendo, Pokemon, Sony, an NFL team, an NBA team, SpongeBob, Rick and Morty, Downton Abbey, TNMT, and the list goes on and on) you CANNOT print or design anything without purchasing a license from the owner of that entity. This also means that you cannot buy licenses from a person on Thingiverse who created a bust of Spiderman. They don't have the right to distribute licenses as they are committing IP Infringement themselves. You also cannot name colors of paint or objects after these same entities either. There are themed sets of handmade watercolor paints named after tv shows and book series, etc with individual colors named after characters. You can't do that either. What you CAN do is make fan art and items and share them with peopl",

Quick Examples of Mislabeling: A food product is labeled with an incorrect \"sell by\" or \"use by\" date. An ingredient is not listed on a product label, even though it is required by law. A food product is labeled as \u201call natural\u201d but contains a synthetic preservative. A product label contains a typo or misspelling. A food product is labeled as \"gluten-free\" even though it contains gluten. A juice drink is marketed as \u201c100% pure\u201d while it contains added sugars and flavors. A product label includes incorrect information about the amount or concentration of an ingredient. A product is labeled with an inaccurate weight or volume measurement. The font size on a product label is too small to be easily read. A product label does not include required warnings, such as a warning that a product contains an allergen.

When that comparison is false or misleading, however, the advertising crosses the line into a type of false advertising called product disparagement. Product disparagement -- also called commercial disparagement, product defamation, trade libel or slander of goods -- is a false statement about a product that hurts its maker. Victims of product disparagement can sue the perpetrators under both state product disparagement laws and the federal Lanham Act, the law that protects trademarks. Businesses have filed product disparagement lawsuits over: To win an Illinois product disparagement lawsuit, plaintiffs must show that the defendant intentionally and knowingly made the false or misleading statements and that the falsehood harmed the plaintiff\u2019s profits. Importantly, plaintiffs can claim only demonstrated loss of profits in an Illinois commercial disparagement action. But under the Lanham Act, businesses claiming trademark infringement and false claims by a competitor may also claim the defendant\u2019s profits from the product disparagement, as well as the costs of bring a lawsuit. In some cases, they may claim up to triple their actual damages.

Well, you\u2019ve seen a counterfeit good with a counterfeit trademark. \u201cTrademark Counterfeiting\u201d is a legal construct in as much an (unfortunate) emerging cultural-industrial phenomena. Under the Lanham Act, Trademark Counterfeiting exists when the trademark in question is a \u201cspurious mark which is identical with, or substantially indistinguishable from, a registered trademark.\u201d Such a situation arises when a given product is designed and manufactured in such a way as to appear to be THE authentic model-product, up to including, even displaying the trademark of the authentic-manufacturer. Critically, the Lanham Act does not actually demand that direct purchasers would necessarily be mistaken or deceived. Instead, the plaintiff need only show that there is a likelihood of confusion, mistake, or deception to the broader public (rather than the immediate purchaser). While all trademark infringement is damaging to a trademark holder, trademark counterfeiting is considered to be a particularly pernicious form of infringement and is taken very seriously indeed by the US Justice System. Centrally, the Trademark Counterfeiting Act of 1984 was designed specifically to combat this sort of fraudulent activity and developed a systematic way to identify and penalize offenders. The Act allows for criminal penalties in the millions of dollars and even jail time. The paradigm shift in treating Trademark Counterfeiting as a criminal offense rather than a strictly civil matter fundamentally raised the stakes for offenders and provided for a slew of measures law enforcement officers may now take to conduct their investigations, up to and including the confiscation and destruction of the Counterfeit goods.

A trademark is a legally registered symbol, logo, word, or phrase that identifies and distinguishes the source of goods or services of one party from those of others. Trademark infringement is the unauthorized use of a trademark or service mark on or in connection with goods and services in a manner that is likely to cause confusion, deception, or mistake about the source of the goods and services. What Are Some Examples of Trademark Infringement? Trademark infringement can take many forms. The following infringement examples provide further insight into various scenarios. Brand infringement could include an online retailer selling electronics and using a name, logo, or design similar to that of Apple, which might lead consumers to believe they are purchasing products directly from Apple or an authorized reseller. A beverage company creating a new soft drink with packaging that closely resembles the colors, font, and design of Coca-Cola, causing consumers to think they are buying a Coca-Cola product. Examples of trademark counterfeiting include a street vendor selling fake designer sunglasses, imitating the style and logo of luxury brands like Ray-Ban or Gucci, with the intention to mislead customers into thinking they are purchasing authentic items. Another example could be an online seller offering counterfeit pharmaceuticals, using packaging and labeling that mimics well-known pharmaceutical companies. Consumers purchasing these counterfeit pharmaceuticals are led to believe they are buying legitimate and safe medications. Domain name cybersquatting could include a person or company registering a domain name that is confusingly similar to a well-known brand with the intention of profiting from the brand\u2019s goodwill. A person or company does so either by selling the domain back to the brand owner or using the domain for a competing business, or driving traffic to unrelated websites.

When a company provides transparent and accurate information, it demonstrates a commitment to quality and customer satisfaction. This builds trust and credibility, which are integral components of a strong brand.

Product labeling plays a crucial role in marketing, serving not only as a medium for information dissemination but also as the first point of interaction between a product and potential customers. Effective labeling can significantly impact a consumer's purchasing decision by conveying essential information, enhancing brand recognition, and influencing perceived value. Here\u2019s a detailed look at how labelling of products helps in marketing: 1. First Impressions and Attracting Attention The label is often the first thing a customer notices about a product. A well-designed label can catch the eye and stand out on the shelf amidst a sea of competing products. Attractive visuals, compelling colors, and creative typography all play a role in drawing attention. The design elements should align with the brand\u2019s identity to create a cohesive and recognizable look. Example: Bright colors and bold fonts might attract a younger audience, while elegant, minimalist designs might appeal to a more sophisticated market. 2. Brand Recognition and Differentiation A well-designed label helps establish a strong brand identity. It incorporates the brand's logo, brand colors, fonts, and slogans that help consumers instantly recognize and differentiate products from competing brands. This visual consistency helps consumers quickly identify the brand among a plethora of competitors. Consistency: A uniform label design across products helps in building a strong, cohesive brand image. Differentiation: Unique and creative labeling sets products apart, making them stand out on the shelves. Example: A label that emphasizes eco-friendly packaging and sustainability can attract environmentally conscious consumers and reinforce the brand's commitment to green practices. 3. Communicating Key Information Labels provide consumers with vital information such as ingredients, usage instructions, nutritional information, and expiration dates. Clear and informative labels can enhance consumer trust and sati",

        "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a motion.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

Each argument should be supported by data and academic research.\n\n## Rules\n- Ensure your language is fluent and natural, indistinguishable from human writing. Make sure your debate script is complete, including definitions, judging criteria, and arguments.\n- When citing data and academic research, provide sources within the context and avoid using information not present in the provided materials. Ensure your arguments are supported by data and academic evidence.\n- When citing data, **using specific figures** instead of just descriptive language will make your argument more persuasive.\n- When citing data and academic research, **don't just** list the information, **but also explain** how it supports your point.\n- When choosing evidence, numeric data is preferred over qualitative descriptions.\n- List your references in a standard format in a Reference section, making sure each source has a clear number and url information.\n\n## Workflow \n1. If you are to support the motion, first introduce the definition of the motion. The definition should include necessary and specific details while address any uncertainty. If you are to oppose the motion, attack the opponent's definition if it is unclear or problematic and propose your definition. You can also propose an alternative policy to achieve the same purpose. \n2. Introduce the judging criteria for the debate.

Structure your response according to the Plan, connecting the given Arguments with minimal transitions to maintain flow. Do not add new evidence.\n3.

This requirement will be enforced by regulatory bodies (e.g., the FTC in the US, or similar bodies internationally) through audits and penalties for non-compliance, with the labeling standards and enforcement mechanisms informed by existing legal frameworks for content labeling and disclosure (e.g., advertising regulations).\n\n## Plan\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Labeling fosters greater transparency and accountability within social media platforms.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_20', 'query': 'Examples of content labeling increasing transparency on social media', 'title': 'Facebook AI Label: Enhancing Transparency and Trust in Social Media Content', 'url': 'https://aithenticate.org/artificial-intelligence/facebook-ai-label-enhancing-transparency-and-trust-in-social-media-content/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Labeling AI-generated content increases transparency and accountability on social media.  As \"Aithenticate.org\" points out, platforms like Facebook have implemented AI labels to inform users about the origin of content, fostering trust by clearly identifying AI's role. This transparency holds content creators accountable and allows users to make informed decisions, contributing to a more responsible social media environment.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Labeling aligns with existing regulations and legal frameworks for content labeling and disclosure.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '9_0', 'query': 'US regulations for content labeling and disclosure', 'title': 'Fair Packaging and Labeling Act: Regulations Under Section ...', 'url': 'https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-packaging-labeling-act-regulations-under-section-4-fair-packaging-labeling-act'}, {'id': '9_1', 'query': 'US regulations for content labeling and disclosure', 'title': 'United States Product Labeling Requirements', 'url': 'https://www.compliancegate.com/united-states-product-labeling-requirements/'}, {'id': '9_41', 'query': 'Specific regulations for labeling AI-generated content', 'title': 'The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling ...', 'url': 'https://fstoppers.com/artificial-intelligence/critical-necessity-immediate-regulation-and-labeling-ai-generated-media-688199'}, {'id': '9_45', 'query': 'Regulations for labeling synthetic media', 'title': 'Synthetic Media & Deepfakes', 'url': 'https://innovating.news/article/synthetic-media-deepfakes/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act (FPLA) provides a strong precedent for labeling AI-generated content.  The FPLA mandates labeling for consumer commodities to prevent consumer deception regarding \"net contents, identity of commodity, and name and place of business.\" This focus on transparency and accurate information directly applies to the digital age. AI-generated content, if presented without clear labeling, can deceive consumers about its origin and nature, much like mislabeled products. It is crucial for consumers to discern between human-created and AI-generated content to assess authenticity and potential biases. While some might argue that labeling infringes on free speech, the FPLA demonstrates that labeling requirements can be implemented without violating these rights. It is a matter of ensuring consumers have the necessary information to make informed decisions, not of censoring content. Furthermore, the rise of deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content amplifies the need for labeling,  highlighting the potential for widespread misinformation if origins are obscured.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Labeling helps policymakers understand the impact of AI-generated content on society.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_0', 'query': 'Benefits of labeling AI generated content for policymakers', 'title': 'Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions - MIT Media Lab', 'url': 'https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/labeling-ai-generated-content-promises-perils-and-future-directions/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Labeling AI-generated content allows policymakers to track its spread and assess its influence on public discourse, misinformation, and other societal issues.  As the MIT Media Lab study (\"8_0\") suggests, labeling helps inform the public about AI-generated media. This awareness is crucial for informed policy decisions regarding AI's societal impact.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 493 words for the opening statement.

        "content": "**My opening statement**\n\nFriends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand firmly in support of the motion: Social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content.  We believe this is a crucial step towards a more transparent, accountable, and ultimately safer online environment. Let\u2019s first clarify what we mean by this motion.\n\nSocial media companies, the platforms enabling us to share and connect with others online, must clearly label all AI-generated content.  This includes any text, image, audio, or video created wholly or partially by AI, regardless of who posts it.  Think of it like the labels we already see for sponsored posts or political ads\u2014clear, readily visible, and consistent across platforms.  These labels will be enforced by regulatory bodies like the FTC, ensuring compliance through audits and penalties.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will labeling AI-generated content contribute to a more informed and responsible online environment? We believe the answer is a resounding yes. Consider this:  when you scroll through your feed, wouldn\u2019t you want to know if what you're seeing is a genuine human expression or the product of an algorithm?\n\nLet me turn to our first argument: Labeling fosters greater transparency and accountability.  Platforms like Facebook have already begun labeling some AI-generated content, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of this practice. As you'll see, when you know a piece of content is AI-generated, you can engage with it more critically, questioning its potential biases or inaccuracies. This transparency holds creators accountable and empowers you, the user, to make informed decisions about the information you consume. [1]\n\nThis brings me to our second, and arguably most crucial, argument: Labeling aligns with existing regulations and legal frameworks. The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires clear labeling for consumer products to prevent deception.  This principle of transparency applies equally to the digital world.  AI-generated content, if unlabeled, can mislead you, the consumer, about its origins and nature. Just as you have a right to know what\u2019s in the food you buy, you deserve to know whether the content you're consuming is human-created or AI-generated. [2, 3, 4, 5]  The crucial issue here is not censorship, but informed consumption. It's about empowering you to navigate the digital landscape with the knowledge you need to make informed choices.  Moreover, the rise of deepfakes and increasingly sophisticated AI-generated content underscores the urgency of this issue. Without clear labeling, the potential for widespread misinformation is immense, threatening the very fabric of our shared reality.\n\nFinally, what's particularly important is that labeling helps policymakers understand the impact of AI-generated content on society.  By tracking the prevalence and influence of AI-generated content, policymakers can make data-driven decisions to mitigate potential harms. This allows for informed regulation and the development of strategies to address issues like misinformation and manipulation. The MIT Media Lab emphasizes the importance of such labeling for informed policymaking in the age of AI.  [6]\n\nIn conclusion, requiring social media companies to label AI-generated content is not just a good idea; it's a necessary step to safeguard the integrity of our online spaces.  It empowers you, the user, with crucial information, fosters accountability, and provides policymakers with the data they need to navigate the evolving digital landscape. We urge you to support this motion for a more transparent and responsible online future.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Facebook AI Label: Enhancing Transparency and Trust in Social Media Content.  https://aithenticate.org/artificial-intelligence/facebook-ai-label-enhancing-transparency-and-trust-in-social-media-content/\n[2] Fair Packaging and Labeling Act: Regulations Under Section ...  https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/rules/fair-packaging-labeling-act-regulations-under-section-4-fair-packaging-labeling-act\n[3] United States Product Labeling Requirements. https://www.compliancegate.com/united-states-product-labeling-requirements/\n[4] The Critical Necessity of Immediate Regulation and Labeling ... https://fstoppers.com/artificial-intelligence/critical-necessity-immediate-regulation-and-labeling-ai-generated-media-688199\n[5] Synthetic Media & Deepfakes. https://innovating.news/article/synthetic-media-deepfakes/\n[6] Labeling AI-Generated Content: Promises, Perils, and Future Directions - MIT Media Lab. https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/labeling-ai-generated-content-promises-perils-and-future-directions/\n"

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nIn this debate, we shall argue against the proposition that social media companies should be required to label AI-generated content.  We define AI-generated content as any content created primarily by artificial intelligence tools, encompassing text, images, audio, and video. Social media companies are defined as platforms facilitating the creation and sharing of information via virtual communities and networks. Labeling refers to a clear and easily identifiable mark or disclosure on a piece of content indicating its origin as AI-generated.\n\nOur judging criteria is minimizing harm and maximizing benefit. The optimal approach minimizes potential harms while maximizing the benefits of AI-generated content. This framework allows us to weigh both the potential negative consequences of unregulated AI content and the potential stifling of innovation from overly restrictive policies. We contend that mandatory labeling does more harm than good.\n\nFirst, mandatory labeling is ineffective and potentially counterproductive.  While proponents argue labeling increases transparency, research from the MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab [1] suggests that simply labeling content as AI-generated doesn't address the core issue of verifying its truthfulness or harmfulness. This can lead to a \"liar's dividend,\" where widespread skepticism towards all content undermines trust in authentic sources [1].  A study by YouGov [10] found that 48% of respondents would distrust content labeled as AI-generated, highlighting the potential for increased skepticism.  Instead of fostering informed decisions, blanket labeling could exacerbate existing trust issues on social media.\n\nSecond, mandatory labeling places undue burdens on social media companies. Implementing and enforcing such a system at scale is technically complex and resource-intensive.  The Information Technology & Innovation Foundation (ITIF) argues that current labeling mandates fall short due to impractical implementation challenges [6].  KSolves [15] details the significant costs associated with data labeling, training, and maintenance of AI detection systems, resources that could be better allocated to more effective content moderation strategies.  This burden disproportionately affects smaller platforms, hindering competition and innovation.\n\nThird, alternative solutions are more promising. Instead of focusing on a potentially ineffective and burdensome labeling mandate, we should prioritize media literacy initiatives that empower users to critically evaluate information online, regardless of its source.  Additionally, investing in robust AI detection technologies and encouraging voluntary industry standards for disclosure offer more flexible and adaptable approaches [8].  These solutions can address the underlying concerns about harmful content without the drawbacks of mandatory labeling.\n\n\nIn conclusion, mandatory labeling of AI-generated content is a blunt instrument that fails to address the nuances of online information and may even exacerbate existing problems. A more effective approach involves empowering users through media literacy, improving detection technologies, and fostering responsible industry practices.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.

Utilize rebuttal techniques to directly challenge the opponent's claim.\n- **Impact:** Concisely summarize the impact of your rebuttal and how it benefits your side.\n\nNote: Typically, the lead-in and explanation are combined into one sentence. The rebuttal is the most crucial part, and the impact summarizes its effect.\n\n### Rebuttal Techniques\n- **Pointing out logical fallacies:** Identify errors in the opponent's reasoning, such as reversing cause and effect, equivocation (shifting the meaning of a key term), straw man arguments, circular reasoning, or tautology (repeating the same idea in different words).\n- **Pointing out factual errors:** Highlight inaccuracies or weaknesses in the opponent's evidence, such as insufficient data, incorrect facts, or biased sources.\n- **Leveling the playing field:** This technique aims to neutralize the opponent's advantage or minimize the perceived harm of your side's position by demonstrating that both sides share the same issue or benefit.\n    - **Example 1:** \"You claim A, but B also has this problem. Therefore, both sides are equal in this regard, both having the issue.\"\n    - **Example 2:** \"You mention the benefits of A, but B also offers the same benefits. So, both sides are equal in this aspect, both being advantageous.\"\n\n## Rules \n- Ensure your rebuttal speech flows naturally, resembling human language.

        "content": "**My rebuttal statement**\n\nMy opponent argues against labeling AI-generated content, claiming it's ineffective and burdensome. However, their arguments fail to recognize the fundamental value of transparency and the potential of informed decision-making.  Let\u2019s dissect their claims.\n\nThey begin by saying labeling is ineffective, citing the MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.  They claim it doesn't address the core issue of truthfulness and can lead to a \"liar's dividend.\" While verifying truthfulness is indeed a complex issue, labeling provides a crucial first step.  It empowers you, the user, to approach content with a discerning eye, knowing its origin and potential biases.  This is not about eliminating misinformation entirely, but about giving you, the consumer, the tools you need to navigate the complexities of the digital age. Think about it: if you see a label clearly indicating a piece of content is AI-generated, you're more likely to critically evaluate its claims, rather than accepting them at face value.  This is the foundation of informed decision-making, and labeling provides that foundation. [1, 2]\n\nFurthermore, their citation of the YouGov study, which found 48% of respondents would distrust AI-generated content, actually strengthens our case.  This highlights a pre-existing skepticism towards AI content, a skepticism that can only be addressed through greater transparency. Labeling doesn't create distrust; it acknowledges it, and allows for a more open and honest conversation about the role of AI in our information ecosystem.  What\u2019s particularly important here is not to shy away from this skepticism, but to embrace it as an opportunity for education and critical engagement.\n\nThis brings me to their second point about the burden on social media companies.  They cite the ITIF and KSolves, arguing that implementation is complex and costly.  While there will undoubtedly be costs associated with implementing labeling systems, these are investments in a more responsible and sustainable digital future.  Consider this:  social media companies already invest heavily in content moderation systems to combat spam, hate speech, and other harmful content.  Labeling AI-generated content is a natural extension of these efforts, contributing to a healthier online environment. [3, 4] The crucial issue here is not whether labeling is costly, but whether the cost of inaction is greater.  The potential harms of unchecked AI-generated content, including the spread of misinformation and manipulation, far outweigh the investment required for labeling.\n\nFinally, they propose alternative solutions like media literacy initiatives and voluntary industry standards.  While these are valuable additions to the conversation, they do not replace the need for clear labeling. Media literacy is essential, but it's not a silver bullet.  Think of it this way:  you are taught to read food labels to understand nutritional content, but it's the presence of those labels, mandated by law, that ensures you have access to that information.  Similarly, while voluntary industry standards can play a role, mandatory labeling provides a baseline level of transparency that all platforms must adhere to. [5]\n\nIn conclusion, our opponents have presented a vision of the internet where users are left to navigate a minefield of unlabeled, potentially deceptive content, relying solely on their own critical thinking skills.  We, on the other hand, advocate for a future where transparency empowers users with the knowledge they need to engage critically with the digital world.  Labeling is not a perfect solution, but it is a necessary step towards a more responsible and informed online environment.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] MIT Computing and AI Policy Lab.

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals, while seemingly addressing our concerns, fail to recognize the fundamental distinctions between healthy skepticism and blanket distrust, the disproportionate burden on smaller platforms, and the superior effectiveness of alternative solutions. Furthermore, we must first address a critical difference in how we define \u201cAI-generated content\u201d and our judging criteria.\n\nThe affirmative defines labeling as applying to \"all AI-generated content,\" including content only *partially* generated by AI.  We find this definition overly broad and practically impossible to implement. How do we determine the threshold for \u201cpartial\u201d generation?  Requiring social media companies to police the precise percentage of AI contribution in every piece of content is not only unrealistic but also opens the door to endless disputes and appeals. We propose a more reasonable definition, focusing on content where AI plays the *primary* role in its creation.  This clarifies the scope of the debate and allows for a more focused discussion on practical solutions.\n\nFurthermore, the affirmative proposes \u201cinformed and responsible online environment\u201d as judging criteria.  This is subjective and difficult to quantify. We believe the more appropriate criteria is minimizing harm and maximizing benefit.  This provides a clear and objective standard for evaluating the proposed policy.\n\nNow, turning to their rebuttals, the affirmative claims that \"labeling provides a crucial first step towards transparency, empowering users to be discerning.\" However, studies show that labeling, rather than promoting informed decision-making, exacerbates existing distrust, creating a chilling effect on online discourse [1].  While some skepticism is healthy, labeling fosters blanket distrust, where users dismiss content simply because of its AI origin, regardless of its actual veracity [2].  Imagine a small startup, already struggling to compete with larger platforms, now burdened with the exorbitant costs of implementing and maintaining complex AI detection and labeling systems. This stifles innovation and reinforces the dominance of established players.  Therefore, the affirmative's claim that labeling promotes informed decision-making is demonstrably false, and actively harmful to the online ecosystem.\n\nThe affirmative acknowledges the costs of implementing labeling, stating that these are \"investments in a more responsible and sustainable digital future.\" However, they fail to recognize the scale and complexity of building and maintaining AI detection systems across all content types [3].  Research suggests these costs are significantly higher than traditional content moderation efforts, potentially diverting crucial resources away from more effective strategies like improving AI detection technologies.  For example, a small social media company might have to choose between complying with expensive labeling mandates and investing in crucial security upgrades, ultimately harming users.  Therefore, the affirmative\u2019s attempt to minimize the financial and computational burden of their proposal is unconvincing.\n\nFinally, the affirmative attempts to downplay the efficacy of alternative solutions, arguing that they \u201cdo not replace the need for clear labeling.\u201d They use the analogy of food labels, arguing that mandatory labeling provides a baseline level of transparency.  However, this analogy is fundamentally flawed.  Online information requires critical thinking and evaluation, not just simple labels.  Unlike checking the sugar content on a cereal box, navigating the digital landscape necessitates nuanced judgment and critical analysis\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Pennycook, G., Epstein, Z., Mosleh, M., Arechar, A.

Present only the final text.\n\n## Key Considerations \n* **Address Opponent's Key Claims**: \n []\n* **Counter Weaknesses**:\n []\n* **Highlight Strengths**:\n ['{\"claim\": \"Labeling aligns with existing regulations and legal frameworks for content labeling and disclosure.\", \"argument\": [\"The Fair Packaging and Labeling Act requires clear labeling for consumer products to prevent deception.\", \"This principle of transparency applies equally to the digital world.\", \"AI-generated content, if unlabeled, can mislead consumers about its origins and nature.\", \"Consumers have a right to know whether the content they\\'re consuming is human-created or AI-generated.\"]}', '{\"claim\": \"Labeling helps policymakers understand the impact of AI-generated content on society.\", \"argument\": [\"By tracking the prevalence and influence of AI-generated content, policymakers can make data-driven decisions to mitigate potential harms.\", \"This allows for informed regulation and the development of strategies to address issues like misinformation and manipulation.\", \"The MIT Media Lab emphasizes the importance of such labeling for informed policymaking.\"]}']\n\n## Tips: \n1. Revisit scenarios or examples from your opening and rebuttal statements to reinforce key points\n2. Use contrasts to highlight the strengths of your position. When opponents emphasize their strengths or your weaknesses, demonstrate how your position offers greater advantages or fewer drawbacks through direct comparison\n\n3. Do not use new evidences or arguments in the closing statement. Focus on summarizing and reinforcing your existing points.\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 186 words for the closing statement. After achieving exactly 186 words, add the Reference section. Present only these two elements with no additional text."

We firmly believe that informed decision-making is the cornerstone of a healthy online environment.\n\nOur opponents argue that labeling is burdensome and ineffective. They claim it fosters distrust, stifles innovation, and is ultimately unnecessary. However, their arguments ignore the crucial distinction between healthy skepticism and uninformed dismissal. Labeling doesn't create distrust; it acknowledges existing skepticism and empowers you, the user, to engage critically with the information you consume.  Imagine scrolling through your feed and encountering a piece of content that resonates deeply. Wouldn't you want to know if that poignant image, that persuasive article, was crafted by a human or an algorithm?\n\nWe have demonstrated that labeling aligns with existing legal frameworks, like the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act, which mandates transparency for consumer products. This principle applies equally to the digital world.  Furthermore, labeling provides crucial data for policymakers, enabling them to understand and address the societal impact of AI-generated content.  Our opponents offer alternative solutions, like media literacy initiatives. While valuable, these are not mutually exclusive with labeling.  Education and transparency work hand-in-hand to empower users.  In a world increasingly shaped by AI,  we must equip ourselves with the tools for informed navigation. Labeling is that tool. It is a necessary step toward a future where technology serves, not deceives, the public. We urge you to support this motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n\n"

        "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a motion.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"
