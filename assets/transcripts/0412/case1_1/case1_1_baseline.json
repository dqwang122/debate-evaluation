      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the debt ceiling, defined as the total amount of money the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations , should be abolished.\n\nOur judging criteria is economic stability and predictability. We believe policies that minimize economic disruptions and promote consistent government operations are superior. Abolishing the debt ceiling directly promotes this standard by eliminating the recurring threat of default and the associated economic uncertainty that harms businesses and consumers .\n\nFirst, abolishing the debt ceiling prevents manufactured economic crises. The debt ceiling is not a tool for fiscal discipline but a mechanism for political brinkmanship. It creates artificial economic crises by threatening default on existing obligations. As the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget notes, brinkmanship around the debt ceiling raises borrowing costs and threatens economic stability . Failing to increase the debt limit would have catastrophic economic consequences, causing the government to default on its legal obligations, precipitating another financial crisis and threatening the jobs and savings of everyday Americans . Removing this self-inflicted wound on the economy promotes stability and predictability.\n\nSecond, abolishing the debt ceiling streamlines fiscal responsibility. The debt ceiling is a redundant mechanism . Congress already approves spending and taxation policies. The debt ceiling merely dictates whether the government can pay for the spending it has already authorized. The Government Accountability Office  recommends that Congress consider immediately replacing it with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions at the time they are made . Abolishing it streamlines fiscal responsibility by aligning spending decisions with the means to finance them, promoting a more transparent and efficient fiscal process.\n\nThird, abolishing the debt ceiling enhances U.S. credibility in the global economy. The debt ceiling debates erode international confidence in the U.S. economy and its ability to meet its obligations . Eliminating the debt ceiling would send a message of stability and fiscal responsibility to global markets, strengthening the dollar and attracting foreign investment. As noted by multiple sources, the debt ceiling causes economic uncertainty and potentially raises interest rates . By removing this uncertainty, the U.S. signals its commitment to honoring its financial commitments.\n\nIn conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling is essential for preventing manufactured economic crises, streamlining fiscal responsibility, and enhancing U.S. credibility. For these reasons, we strongly advocate for the abolition of the debt ceiling to foster economic stability and predictability.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amadeo, K. (2023, January 19).

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue against the abolition of the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is defined as the total amount of money that the United States government is allowed to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and other payments . It is crucial to understand the debt ceiling as a limit on borrowing to fulfill *existing* obligations.\n\nOur judging criteria is **fiscal prudence**. The optimal policy regarding the debt ceiling is the one that best ensures long-term fiscal prudence and economic stability for the United States. We define fiscal prudence as responsible management of government finances, characterized by sustainable debt levels, controlled spending, and avoidance of actions that could lead to economic crises. This is the most appropriate standard because it directly addresses the core concern surrounding the debt ceiling: the nation's financial health and stability.\n\nFirst, abolishing the debt ceiling removes a critical mechanism for fiscal oversight and accountability. The debt ceiling, though often a point of political contention, forces Congress to periodically review and authorize government borrowing. This process provides a crucial opportunity for debate and scrutiny of government spending. Removing this mechanism eliminates a layer of oversight, potentially leading to unchecked spending and increased national debt. For example, in 1995, Republican members of Congress used the threat of refusing to allow an increase in the debt ceiling to negotiate increased government spending cuts . This demonstrates the debt ceiling's potential to curb excessive spending. Some analysts argue that by requiring legislative consent, the debt limit affords Congress some oversight authority and engenders fiscal accountability . The debt ceiling can therefore be a useful tool to remind everyone of the burden of debt to the economy .\n\nSecond, abolishing the debt ceiling creates the risk of unlimited government borrowing, leading to economic instability. Without a limit on borrowing, the government could potentially accumulate unsustainable levels of debt, leading to higher interest rates, inflation, and a potential economic crisis. Unlimited borrowing can also crowd out private investment and undermine long-term economic growth. As *The Economist* notes, the US federal government has spent $2 trillion, or 7.2% of GDP, more than it has raised in taxes recently, despite a strong economy . This level of borrowing, even with the debt ceiling in place, raises concerns about fiscal responsibility. Removing the debt ceiling could exacerbate this trend, potentially leading to higher interest rates and reduced government services .\n\nThird, alternatives to abolishing the debt ceiling offer more effective and less risky approaches to fiscal management. Instead of completely removing the debt ceiling, there are alternative mechanisms that can improve fiscal responsibility, such as linking debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions or capping the debt-to-GDP ratio. These alternatives maintain a degree of fiscal control without the drastic risks associated with abolishing the debt ceiling entirely. The Government Accountability Office  has recommended that Congress consider replacing the current debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions at the time they are made . This approach could provide a more comprehensive and responsible framework for managing the national debt.\n\nIn conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal prudence and economic stability. It removes a vital mechanism for oversight, invites unlimited borrowing, and neglects more effective alternative solutions. We, therefore, stand firmly against the abolition of the debt ceiling.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) NPR. 2023. An economist\u2019s case for abolishing the debt ceiling.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments contain three key flaws, relating to judging criteria, fiscal oversight, and the risk of unlimited borrowing.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues for \"fiscal prudence\" as the primary judging criterion. However, we contend that this misses the forest for the trees. Economic stability and social welfare are *preconditions* for fiscal prudence. How can any nation be fiscally responsible amidst economic chaos or widespread social distress? Focusing solely on managing resources, as the opposition suggests, neglects the crucial outcomes of stability and well-being. Numerous economists, such as those at the Brookings Institute , emphasize that economic stability is vital for long-term fiscal health. We maintain our stance that the optimal policy promotes greater economic stability and social welfare, as these are the foundations upon which fiscal prudence can be built.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the debt ceiling is a critical mechanism for fiscal oversight, forcing Congress to review government spending. This argument ignores the fundamental reality that Congress *already* approves all spending through the budget process . The debt ceiling, therefore, is nothing more than a redundant second review of the same expenditures. It\u2019s akin to approving a purchase and then refusing to pay the bill. This duplication not only wastes time and resources but also creates opportunities for political brinkmanship, as evidenced by the 2011 debt ceiling crisis that led to a credit downgrade of U.S. debt . Instead of ensuring fiscal responsibility, the debt ceiling has become a political tool that threatens economic stability. Many developed nations, like Canada and Australia, manage their finances effectively without a debt ceiling , demonstrating that budget process is the proper mechanism for fiscal oversight.\n\nThird, the opposition warns that abolishing the debt ceiling creates the risk of unlimited government borrowing. This claim rests on the unsupported assumption that abolishing the debt ceiling *automatically* leads to fiscal irresponsibility. However, as Treasury.gov indicates, other effective mechanisms exist to prevent unlimited borrowing, including budget resolutions, congressional oversight, and public pressure . The debt ceiling itself has often *exacerbated* fiscal mismanagement by creating artificial deadlines and political brinkmanship , not the other way around. Furthermore, the opposition fails to acknowledge that several countries, such as New Zealand and Sweden, have successfully managed government borrowing without a debt ceiling . The issue at hand is not the *existence* of a debt ceiling, but the potential for it to trigger artificial crises and undermine economic stability.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Brookings Institute.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition\u2019s rebuttals contain several flaws, specifically in their understanding of fiscal responsibility and the role of the debt ceiling. We will address their points concerning the \"check engine\" light analogy, the creation of artificial crises, the harm to vulnerable populations, the comparison to Canada and Australia, the continuous increase in national debt, and the 2011 downgrade.\n\nFirst, they use the analogy of a \"check engine\" light to dismiss the debt ceiling, but this is a false analogy. The \"check engine\" light indicates an existing problem, while the debt ceiling *prevents* a future problem \u2013 unchecked government spending. Both sides acknowledge potential \"market jitters,\" but we argue that these are a necessary and acceptable consequence of maintaining fiscal responsibility to ensure financial stability in the long term .\n\nSecond, the opposition claims the debt ceiling manufactures crises, but the potential for a crisis is a *feature*, not a bug. It forces Congress to confront the issue of spending and borrowing. They focus on short-term \"market jitters\" while ignoring the long-term consequences of unchecked debt. The debt ceiling provides a credible commitment to limit spending, preventing economic disaster .\n\nThird, while we acknowledge the potential harm to vulnerable populations, we argue that long-term fiscal irresponsibility resulting from abolishing the debt ceiling would ultimately harm these populations *even more*. The debt ceiling is a mechanism to protect the long-term financial health of the country, which is essential for maintaining social safety nets .\n\nFourth, the opposition points to Canada and Australia as examples of sound fiscal management without a debt ceiling, but their economic and political situations are different from the U.S. Their fiscal management systems may not be directly applicable here, and we must consider the unique challenges facing the U.S. economy .\n\nFifth, the continuous increase in national debt *despite* the debt ceiling is a reason to maintain it, not abolish it. Eliminating the debt ceiling would remove the last remaining constraint on government spending. Unlimited borrowing can lead to higher interest rates, inflation, and economic instability, harming future generations .\n\nSixth, regarding the 2011 downgrade, while we acknowledge it, it was a *one-time* event triggered by a specific political situation of failing to pass the debt ceiling. This actually *proves* that the debt ceiling is a mechanism to drive fiscal decisions, ensuring that the government addresses its spending habits .\n\nIn conclusion, we maintain that abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal prudence and economic stability. It removes a vital mechanism for oversight, invites unlimited borrowing, and neglects more effective alternative solutions. For these reasons, we stand firmly against the abolition of the debt ceiling.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) NPR. 2023. An economist\u2019s case for abolishing the debt ceiling.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the efficacy of the debt ceiling as a tool for fiscal oversight and its impact on economic stability and social welfare.\n\nFirst, on the issue of fiscal oversight, we\u2019ve decisively won this battleground. The negative clings to the idea that the debt ceiling is a crucial check on spending. But we've proven it's a *redundant* mechanism. Congress *already* controls spending through the budget process . The debt ceiling is like approving a purchase and then refusing to pay the bill \u2013 absurd and economically damaging.\n\nThey claim the *potential* for a crisis is a *feature*. We say that's like arguing a car crash is a good thing because it forces you to check your insurance! The 2011 downgrade, triggered by debt ceiling brinkmanship, wasn't just a \"one-time event.\" It was a stark warning of the real-world consequences of playing political games with our nation's creditworthiness . And let's not forget credit warnings from Fitch Ratings echoing the same concerns . The debt ceiling doesn't *prevent* economic disaster, it *invites* it! Studies show that the debt continues to rise *despite* the debt ceiling, proving its ineffectiveness .\n\nSecond, we must consider the devastating impact on vulnerable populations. The negative argues long-term fiscal irresponsibility would hurt these populations even more. But we've shown the debt ceiling causes *immediate and direct* harm. Research indicates that the recent debt ceiling deal could strip almost 750,000 adults of their SNAP benefits . This isn't hypothetical. It's happening *now*, because of the debt ceiling.\n\nFinally, the negative dismisses the examples of Canada and Australia. They claim their situations are \"different.\" But the underlying principle remains the same: a debt ceiling is not *necessary* for sound fiscal management.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Debt Ceiling Explainer | House Budget Committee Democrats.
