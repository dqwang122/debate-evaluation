      "content": "We are here today to address a critical juncture in the evolution of art, a point where artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the creative landscape. We stand firm in our conviction that this AI-driven transformation, despite its allure, ultimately precipitates a decline in human creative arts. This \"decline,\" as we define it, signifies a tangible erosion of originality, diversity, and accessibility within artistic expression, leading to a concerning homogenization and concentration of creative output. Our criterion for success in this debate rests on demonstrating the long-term impact of AI on these three pillars of art: originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n\nThe core mechanism by which AI fosters this decline lies in algorithmic bias, the replication of existing styles, and unequal access to technology.\n\nFirst, let's consider the stifling of innovation. Generative AI learns from existing artifacts to generate new content . AI's data-driven nature inherently curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. This creates a feedback loop, where popular styles are perpetually reinforced, while novel or unconventional creative paths are suppressed. The result is a homogenization of artistic output, where originality is sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic efficiency. The integration of AI in the creative process raises concerns about the homogenization of artistic styles and the potential loss of human ingenuity . This is not merely a theoretical concern; it is a demonstrable trend that threatens the very essence of artistic exploration.\n\nSecond, AI tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes. If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society. This is particularly alarming in the context of cultural representation, where AI-generated art can perpetuate narrow and discriminatory portrayals of marginalized communities. The danger here is that AI, rather than serving as a tool for progress, becomes an instrument for entrenching existing prejudices.\n\nThird, AI art generation exacerbates existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology. Access to AI art tools is uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds. The rise of AI will not democratize art, but stratify it, based on access. Marketplaces use AI algorithms to recommend artworks based on a buyer\u2019s preferences and past purchases . This creates collecting vacuums, further marginalizing artists who do not fit the algorithmic profile. The sale of a piece painted by a humanoid robot for over $1 million has captured public attention, signifying a shift in how collectors and galleries .\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI, while presenting certain novel capabilities, poses a grave threat to the originality, diversity, and accessibility of human creative arts. The fusion of technologies promises to enrich the art landscape rather than diminish it . For these compelling reasons, we stand resolute in affirming the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Generative AI: What Is It, Tools, Models, Applications and Use Cases.\n\n[2] Danilo.

      "content": "In this debate, we contend that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"human creative arts\" as the expression of human imagination and skill in visual forms, appreciated for their beauty and emotional power. A \"decline\" refers to a gradual loss of quality, originality, and cultural value.\n\nOur judging criterion is artistic and cultural enrichment. The side that demonstrates a greater contribution to artistic innovation, cultural expression, and overall human experience should win.\n\nFirst, AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. While AI can generate impressive outputs, it lacks the emotional depth, subjective experience, and genuine originality inherent in human creativity . AI relies on algorithms and data, lacking the ability to make intuitive decisions based on lived experiences . According to poeticmind.co.uk, human creativity stems from genuine interest, deliberate choices, unique perspectives, emotions, problem-finding, complex cognitive processes, spontaneous originality, personal insights, and self-expression, all of which AI cannot replicate . Therefore, AI cannot lead to a decline because it cannot truly replace human-made art.\n\nSecond, AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity. Far from replacing artists, AI is increasingly used as a collaborative tool . As Al-Ghamdi notes in arab.news, AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool to enrich it . It assists with idea generation, style exploration, and overcoming creative blocks, pushing the boundaries of human artistic expression . theconversation.com highlights that combining AI's rapid iteration with human vision overcomes AI model limitations, particularly in commissioned art requiring specific outputs .\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns limit AI\u2019s impact on creative arts. The ethical and legal debates surrounding AI art, including copyright infringement, consent for training data, and potential job displacement, naturally limit its dominance . As aaronhall.com reports, copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, creating legal uncertainty . A stronger emphasis on the value of human creativity leads to appropriate regulations and protections, thus limiting the potential for AI to cause a decline in human creative arts.\n\nIn conclusion, AI lacks the essential elements of human creativity, serves as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artists, and faces ethical and legal limitations that prevent it from causing a decline in human creative arts. We urge you to side with the negative.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew. \"The Downside of AI Art: Why It's Not a Substitute for Human Creativity.\" https://www.digitalbrew.com/the-downside-of-ai-art-why-its-not-a-substitute-for-human-creativity/\n(2) Addepto. \"What Is Generative AI and Will It Replace Human Creativity?\" https://addepto.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-and-will-it-replace-human-creativity/\n(3) Poetic Mind. \"Human Creativity vs AI Creativity.\" https://www.poeticmind.co.uk/journal-creativity-and-inspiration/volume-2-issue-3/human-creativity-vs-ai-creativity-infographic/\n(4) Ijfrm. \"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Creative Arts.\" https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/6/32948.pdf\n(5) Arab News. \"AI is not a substitute for human creativity.\" https://arab.news/g5pwa\n(6) The AI Prompt Shop. \"AI vs Traditional Art.\" https://theaipromptshop.com/blogs/news/ai-vs-traditional-art-can-machines-truly-be-creative\n(7) The Conversation. \"AI can produce prize-winning art, but it still can't compete with human creativity.\" https://theconversation.com/ai-can-produce-prize-winning-art-but-it-still-cant-compete-with-human-creativity-190279\n(8) Toolify. \"AI Art: Redefining Creativity or Threatening Artists' Livelihoods?\" https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/ai-art-redefining-creativity-or-threatening-artists-livelihoods-821245\n(9) Aaronhall. \"AI-Generated Art Style Copyright Infringement.\" https://aaronhall.com/ai-generated-art-style-copyright-infringement/"

      "content": "The opposing side attempts to define \"human creative arts\" and \"decline\" in ways that conveniently ignore the core issues. Their narrow focus on imagination, skill, beauty, and emotional power overlooks the crucial elements of originality, diversity, and accessibility that we've emphasized. Limiting \"decline\" to a loss of quality and cultural value also fails to address the tangible erosion of diversity and accessibility that AI accelerates. Their suggested judging criterion is incomplete, neglecting these vital aspects. This incomplete definition weakens their entire argument.\n\nThey argue that AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. This misses the central point. The critical issue is that AI's ability to mimic art styles, even without genuine emotion, will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art. It's like a baker who can replicate any cake flawlessly but doesn't understand the joy, the passion, the *soul* of baking. The output may be superficially similar, but the value, the artistic integrity, is fundamentally diminished. This flooding of the market with derivative works directly diminishes the originality and diversity of artistic expression, fulfilling our definition of \"decline.\" While AI can be used as a tool, its accessibility breeds over-reliance. This dependence stifles true artistic development, leading to a decline in genuine skill and innovation.\n\nLet's reiterate: AI curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. Imagine AI being given millions of recipes. It might create new combinations, but it will inherently favor popular dishes over experimental cuisine. This homogenization reduces diversity. Furthermore, AI will amplify societal biases present in its training data, perpetuating inequalities in the art world. Access to AI-driven art is also not equal. The accessibility of AI art tools doesn't guarantee equal opportunity; instead, it risks widening the gap between artists with technological resources and those without, potentially marginalizing traditional art forms and artists. Ethical and legal concerns are unlikely to stem the tide, as technology outpaces regulations. Even with guidelines, the flood of AI-generated content will devalue human work.\n\nConsider the long-term consequences. Imagine a future where art is primarily generated by algorithms, catering to popular tastes and reinforcing existing biases. What happens to the artists who pour their heart and soul into their work, who strive to create something truly original and meaningful? What happens to the diversity of artistic expression when algorithms prioritize established styles?\n\nThink of Mrs. Rodriguez, a talented sculptor who can't afford AI tools. Her work, while beautiful and deeply personal, will be overshadowed by AI-generated pieces produced at a fraction of the cost. Her livelihood, her passion, her contribution to the cultural landscape \u2013 all diminished by the rise of AI art. This is not just about individual artists; it's about the future of human creativity itself.\n\nTherefore, we urge you to support policies that ensure fair compensation for human artists and promote transparency in the AI art market. Let us choose to support human creativity, originality, and diversity. Let us not allow the ease and accessibility of AI to erode the very essence of human artistic expression.\n\n**Reference**\n[1]"

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals contain several flaws, primarily centered around their overly broad definition of \"decline,\" their neglect of the collaborative role of AI, and their misunderstanding of the market's adaptive capabilities.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of \"decline\" to include anything less than perfect accessibility and absolute originality. We contend that \"artistic and cultural enrichment,\" our stated criterion, implicitly includes originality and diversity because, without novelty, there is no cultural enrichment. Moreover, accessibility, while important, is a separate issue, pertaining to resource availability, not the inherent quality or value of art. Art movements, such as Impressionism, initially faced limited accessibility but eventually gained widespread recognition and significantly enriched culture . Therefore, the quality and cultural value of art can increase regardless of immediate accessibility.\n\nSecond, the affirmative claims that AI will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art, likening it to a baker without a soul. This argument overlooks historical parallels. When photography emerged, similar claims were made about its lack of artistic merit and its potential to replace painters. Yet, photography became a distinct art form, expanding the artistic landscape, not destroying it . Similarly, digital art, initially met with skepticism, has grown into a thriving market. We anticipate the art market will adapt. Consumers will still value original human art for its unique qualities, emotional depth, and personal expression. AI art will likely increase the size of the overall art market, creating new opportunities for artists as a whole .\n\nThird, the affirmative argues that AI amplifies societal biases and creates unequal access to art tools. It's important to recognize that AI bias is a known challenge, and researchers are actively developing mitigation techniques to address this . Furthermore, while unequal access is a valid concern, the availability of free or low-cost AI tools is increasing, democratizing access and enabling more artists to experiment with AI . This trend counteracts the notion that AI only benefits a privileged few.\n\nFourth, regarding the ethical concerns, the affirmative suggests these are unlikely to stem the tide. However, increased awareness of these issues is leading to stronger regulations and industry standards, limiting the potential for AI to negatively impact human artists . Copyright lawsuits are already being filed to protect artists' rights, and ethical guidelines for AI art development and use are emerging . These developments demonstrate a proactive approach to ensuring AI is used responsibly in the creative arts.\n\nFifth, AI lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity . AI can mimic creativity but cannot fully replace the unique human touch, which stems from genuine emotions and experiences .\n\nSixth, AI is increasingly used as a tool to enhance human creativity, assisting with idea generation and technical aspects, leading to collaborative projects where AI supports human artists .\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative's arguments are based on an overly broad definition of decline and a misunderstanding of both historical trends and the current trajectory of AI development. For these reasons, we stand firmly on the negative side.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heilbrun, F., & Gernsheim, A. (1997). Photography: History and art. Thames & Hudson.\n(2) The J. Paul Getty Museum.

Our opponents suggest AI is just a tool, but they ignore the critical point: AI-driven art narrows artistic vision by merely copying existing styles and reinforcing biases.\n\nThey suggest ethical guidelines will control AI's influence. However, even with these rules, AI's widespread presence reduces originality, diversity, and accessibility. Envision a future where algorithms control artistic expression. The outcome is a standardization of styles, suppressing unique voices and viewpoints.\n\nThe opposition argues the art market will adjust, but adjustment isn't the same as improvement. The massive amount of AI art risks cheapening human skill, passion, and emotional connection. It establishes an unfair competition, favoring those with technological resources over those with artistic talent.\n\nTheir argument about emotional depth is irrelevant. The reality is that AI, even without emotions, can replicate art styles so well that it will overwhelm the market with unoriginal works, decreasing originality and diversity. Is this the artistic future we desire? Where algorithms dominate?\n\nWe insist that AI will not democratize art; it will divide it. We believe human expression should not be reduced to a technological process. The core of this debate is not just about creativity; it's about protecting human values in art. Let's choose to support human creativity and originality, not algorithmic efficiency. We must champion the unique perspectives and emotional depth that only human artists can bring.

First let's address the definition of decline. The affirmative broadened it to include any perceived lack of perfect accessibility and absolute originality but we maintain that artistic and cultural enrichment our stated criterion. Implicitly includes novelty. You cannot enriched culture without adding something new and original. Furthermore accessibility is a separate issue.

distraction, hindering memory consolidation and critical thinking.;\n**Content:** Individually, our constant interaction with smart devices creates an environment of perpetual distraction. We check our phones roughly 150 times a day, every six minutes of our waking hours. This constant influx of information overloads our working memory, which has a limited capacity of only two to four pieces of information at a time. This \"cognitive overload\" hinders memory consolidation, the process of transferring information from working memory to long-term memory where true knowledge is formed. This constant distraction prevents us from deeply processing information, hindering critical, creative, and conceptual thinking.\n**Argument:** People check their phones roughly 150 times a day, every six minutes. Constant information influx overloads working memory. Cognitive overload hinders memory consolidation. Distraction prevents deep processing and hinders critical thinking.\n\n**Claim:** Smart technology steals the time needed for reflection and deep thought, ultimately hindering the creation of knowledge and wisdom.\n**Purpose:** propose => Smart technology steals the time needed for reflection and deep thought, ultimately hindering the creation of knowledge and wisdom.;\n**Content:** While access to information is valuable, information is not knowledge. Smart technology, by bombarding us with constant notifications, steals the time needed for reflection and deep thought, ultimately hindering the creation of knowledge and wisdom.\n**Argument:** Information is not knowledge. Smart technology bombards users with constant notifications. Constant notifications steal time for reflection and deep thought. Hindering reflection hinders the creation of knowledge and wisdom.\n\n**Claim:** Smart technology cultivates a culture of intimacy and personalization, fostering echo chambers and undermining genuine communication.\n**Purpose:** propose => Smart technology cultivates a culture of intimacy and personalization, fostering echo chambers and undermining genuine communication.;\n**Content:** Societally, this technology cultivates a culture of intimacy and personalization, an \"end of distance,\" where everyone broadcasts their thoughts without truly listening. This fosters an echo chamber where pre-existing beliefs are constantly reinforced, hindering genuine communication and understanding.\n**Argument:** Technology cultivates a culture of intimacy and personalization. Everyone broadcasts their thoughts without truly listening. Echo chambers reinforce pre-existing beliefs. Echo chambers hinder genuine communication and understanding.\n\n**Claim:** Smart technology undermines professionals who create and disseminate knowledge, devaluing expertise and critical thinking.\n**Purpose:** propose => Smart technology undermines professionals who create and disseminate knowledge, devaluing expertise and critical thinking.;\n**Content:** Furthermore, this \"smart\" technology ironically undermines the very professionals who create and disseminate knowledge. The decline of newspapers, the music industry, and professional writing careers demonstrates how the democratization of information can devalue expertise and critical thinking.\n**Argument:** Smart technology undermines professionals who create and disseminate knowledge. The decline of newspapers, the music industry, and professional writing careers demonstrates this. Democratization of information can devalue expertise and critical thinking.\n===================================\n\n"

        "original_statement": "We are here today to discuss the future of art, a future increasingly shaped by artificial intelligence. We contend that this future, while promising in some respects, ultimately leads to a decline in human creative arts. By \"decline,\" we mean a measurable reduction in the originality, diversity, and accessibility of artistic expression. Our criterion for judging this debate will be which side best demonstrates the long-term impact of AI on these three aspects.\n\nAs you\u2019ll see, AI's data-driven approach stifles artistic innovation by prioritizing popular styles over genuine experimentation. AI learns from existing datasets, reinforcing established trends. This leads to homogenization and discourages artists from exploring novel or unconventional creative paths, ultimately limiting artistic evolution. Think of it as a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away.\n\nConsider this: AI-driven creative tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes. If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society. Like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\n\nFinally, AI art generation could exacerbate existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology. Access to AI art tools may be uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds. The crucial issue here is that the rise of AI will not democratize art, but stratify it, based on access.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that AI, while offering new tools, poses a significant threat to the originality, diversity, and accessibility of human creative arts. For these reasons, we strongly affirm the resolution.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan:**\n\nFor this debate, we will define \"decline\" in the context of creative arts as a measurable reduction in originality, diversity, and accessibility, leading to a homogenization and concentration of creative output. Our judging criterion will be based on which side better demonstrates the long-term impact of AI on these three aspects: originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n\nI will focus on three main arguments, allotting roughly equal time to each:\n\n1.  **Stifled Innovation:** We'll argue that AI's data-driven nature inherently limits true artistic innovation. (175 words)\n2.  **Amplified Biases:** We'll demonstrate how AI tools perpetuate societal stereotypes. (175 words)\n3.  **Exacerbated Inequalities:** We'll highlight how unequal access to AI tools creates further disparities in the art world. (175 words)\n\nI will use examples throughout to illustrate my points, and analogies to clarify complex concepts. I aim to address potential counterarguments preemptively to reinforce the strength of my position. I will prioritize demonstrating the interconnectedness of these three arguments, emphasizing how they compound to create a significant decline in human creative arts. We need to win on originality, diversity and accessibility to win this debate.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message, that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, is generally clear. The definition of \"decline\" as a reduction in originality, diversity, and accessibility is helpful. The criterion for judging the debate is also clearly stated. However, the logical flow between the initial statement of the claims and the subsequent points could be strengthened. The connection between data-driven approaches and stifled innovation could be made more explicit at the outset.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe opening includes analogies (garden needing tending, car maintenance, ignoring climate warning signs) which attempt to connect with the audience. However, these analogies feel somewhat disconnected from the core arguments about AI and art, which lessens their effectiveness. The opening struggles to maintain attention, as the analogies feel a bit random.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe statement uses examples of how AI can reinforce biases and exacerbate inequalities. While these are strong points, the evidence is presented without specific data or expert sources. There are no quantifiable metrics given, and the examples feel somewhat anecdotal. The arguments rely more on logical deduction than concrete evidence.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe emotional resonance is present, particularly in the concern for disadvantaged artists. The practical relevance is highlighted by pointing out existing inequalities in the art world. However, the feasibility of solutions is not addressed. There is no clear call to action beyond affirming the resolution.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of direct connection between the analogies and the arguments.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may find the analogies confusing or irrelevant, weakening the overall persuasive impact. The shift between the abstract point and the analogy can feel abrupt.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Shorten or remove the analogies. If keeping them, more directly link them to the specific impact of AI on art *before* launching into the extended analogy. For example, before the \"garden\" analogy, say something like, \"AI's focus on replicating existing styles is like a neglected garden, where...\"\n\n2. **Issue:** Insufficient evidence and data to support the claims.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The arguments may sound speculative or opinion-based, rather than grounded in fact. The audience might perceive a lack of seriousness or credibility in the points being made.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add specific examples or cite studies to back up the claims. For example, when discussing the homogenization of art, mention a specific study that analyzes the stylistic similarity of AI-generated art compared to human-created art, or provide an example of an AI tool that perpetuates such homogenization.\n\n3. **Issue:** Lack of clarity on the mechanisms by which AI stifles originality/diversity/accessibility.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The audience might not fully grasp *how* AI actually causes these negative effects, making the arguments less convincing.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** In the introduction, after defining \"decline,\" briefly outline the main *mechanisms* by which AI will lead to this decline (e.g., \"through algorithmic bias, the replication of existing styles, and unequal access to technology\"). This will serve as a roadmap for the rest of the opening statement. Then, when presenting each point, reiterate how that point relates back to these mechanisms.\n\n4.  **Issue:** The claims are quite generic, and do not show any creative thinking.\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** This will allow audiences to predict arguments or lose their engagement.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add the most shocking negative impact in each claims or arguments to grab audience's attention.\n"

We stand firm in our conviction that this AI-driven transformation, despite its allure, ultimately precipitates a decline in human creative arts. This \"decline,\" as we define it, signifies a tangible erosion of originality, diversity, and accessibility within artistic expression, leading to a concerning homogenization and concentration of creative output. Our criterion for success in this debate rests on demonstrating the long-term impact of AI on these three pillars of art: originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n\nThe core mechanism by which AI fosters this decline lies in algorithmic bias, the replication of existing styles, and unequal access to technology.\n\nFirst, let's consider the stifling of innovation. Generative AI learns from existing artifacts to generate new content [1]. AI's data-driven nature inherently curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. This creates a feedback loop, where popular styles are perpetually reinforced, while novel or unconventional creative paths are suppressed. The result is a homogenization of artistic output, where originality is sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic efficiency. The integration of AI in the creative process raises concerns about the homogenization of artistic styles and the potential loss of human ingenuity [2]. This is not merely a theoretical concern; it is a demonstrable trend that threatens the very essence of artistic exploration.\n\nSecond, AI tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes. If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society. This is particularly alarming in the context of cultural representation, where AI-generated art can perpetuate narrow and discriminatory portrayals of marginalized communities. The danger here is that AI, rather than serving as a tool for progress, becomes an instrument for entrenching existing prejudices.\n\nThird, AI art generation exacerbates existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology. Access to AI art tools is uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds. The rise of AI will not democratize art, but stratify it, based on access. Marketplaces use AI algorithms to recommend artworks based on a buyer\u2019s preferences and past purchases [3]. This creates collecting vacuums, further marginalizing artists who do not fit the algorithmic profile. The sale of a piece painted by a humanoid robot for over $1 million has captured public attention, signifying a shift in how collectors and galleries [4].\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI, while presenting certain novel capabilities, poses a grave threat to the originality, diversity, and accessibility of human creative arts. The fusion of technologies promises to enrich the art landscape rather than diminish it [5].

        "statement": "In this debate, we contend that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"human creative arts\" as the expression of human imagination and skill in visual forms, appreciated for their beauty and emotional power. A \"decline\" refers to a gradual loss of quality, originality, and cultural value.\n\nOur judging criterion is artistic and cultural enrichment. The side that demonstrates a greater contribution to artistic innovation, cultural expression, and overall human experience should win.\n\nFirst, AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. While AI can generate impressive outputs, it lacks the emotional depth, subjective experience, and genuine originality inherent in human creativity . AI relies on algorithms and data, lacking the ability to make intuitive decisions based on lived experiences . According to poeticmind.co.uk, human creativity stems from genuine interest, deliberate choices, unique perspectives, emotions, problem-finding, complex cognitive processes, spontaneous originality, personal insights, and self-expression, all of which AI cannot replicate . Therefore, AI cannot lead to a decline because it cannot truly replace human-made art.\n\nSecond, AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity. Far from replacing artists, AI is increasingly used as a collaborative tool . As Al-Ghamdi notes in arab.news, AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool to enrich it . It assists with idea generation, style exploration, and overcoming creative blocks, pushing the boundaries of human artistic expression . theconversation.com highlights that combining AI's rapid iteration with human vision overcomes AI model limitations, particularly in commissioned art requiring specific outputs .\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns limit AI\u2019s impact on creative arts. The ethical and legal debates surrounding AI art, including copyright infringement, consent for training data, and potential job displacement, naturally limit its dominance . As aaronhall.com reports, copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, creating legal uncertainty . A stronger emphasis on the value of human creativity leads to appropriate regulations and protections, thus limiting the potential for AI to cause a decline in human creative arts.\n\nIn conclusion, AI lacks the essential elements of human creativity, serves as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artists, and faces ethical and legal limitations that prevent it from causing a decline in human creative arts. We urge you to side with the negative.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew. \"The Downside of AI Art: Why It's Not a Substitute for Human Creativity.\" https://www.digitalbrew.com/the-downside-of-ai-art-why-its-not-a-substitute-for-human-creativity/\n(2) Addepto. \"What Is Generative AI and Will It Replace Human Creativity?\" https://addepto.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-and-will-it-replace-human-creativity/\n(3) Poetic Mind. \"Human Creativity vs AI Creativity.\" https://www.poeticmind.co.uk/journal-creativity-and-inspiration/volume-2-issue-3/human-creativity-vs-ai-creativity-infographic/\n(4) Ijfrm. \"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Creative Arts.\" https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/6/32948.pdf\n(5) Arab News. \"AI is not a substitute for human creativity.\" https://arab.news/g5pwa\n(6) The AI Prompt Shop. \"AI vs Traditional Art.\" https://theaipromptshop.com/blogs/news/ai-vs-traditional-art-can-machines-truly-be-creative\n(7) The Conversation. \"AI can produce prize-winning art, but it still can't compete with human creativity.\" https://theconversation.com/ai-can-produce-prize-winning-art-but-it-still-cant-compete-with-human-creativity-190279\n(8) Toolify. \"AI Art: Redefining Creativity or Threatening Artists' Livelihoods?\" https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/ai-art-redefining-creativity-or-threatening-artists-livelihoods-821245\n(9) Aaronhall. \"AI-Generated Art Style Copyright Infringement.\" https://aaronhall.com/ai-generated-art-style-copyright-infringement/",

regulation creates an environment ripe for unethical behavior, unlike the stock market with the SEC.\n**Purpose:** rebut => The art market lacks investor protection safeguards present in the stock market, enabling unethical practices.;attack => The art market is driven by a passion for art, not simply greed, and artists are sustained by professional respect, not just money.;reinforce => The art market lacks investor protection safeguards present in the stock market, enabling unethical practices.;\n**Content:** While I admire the market\u2019s dynamism and inconsistencies, its lack of regulation creates an environment ripe for unethical behavior. Unlike the stock market, where the SEC, however imperfectly, protects the public, the art market operates without safeguards. This leaves it vulnerable to manipulation, as evidenced by historical examples like the Duveen/Berenson collusion, which manipulated art history for profit.\n**Argument:** The art market lacks regulation, leading to unethical behavior. The stock market has the SEC to protect the public, though imperfectly. The art market's lack of safeguards makes it vulnerable to manipulation. Historical examples like the Duveen/Berenson collusion demonstrate manipulation for profit.\n\n**Claim:** Practices like chandelier bidding highlight deceptive tactics used to inflate prices and create artificial competition in the art market.\n**Purpose:** reinforce => The art market lacks investor protection safeguards present in the stock market, enabling unethical practices.;\n**Content:** Furthermore, practices like chandelier bidding, whether past or present, highlight the deceptive tactics used to inflate prices and create artificial competition.  A buyer relying on auction prices for valuation is misled when phantom bids create a false sense of market demand.  This isn't the vibrant theater of art; it's the theater of market manipulation.  While someone ultimately buys the piece, the process itself is tainted.\n**Argument:** Chandelier bidding is a deceptive tactic. It inflates prices and creates artificial competition. Buyers are misled by phantom bids creating a false sense of market demand. The process is tainted even if someone ultimately buys the piece.\n\n**Claim:** Existing rules and organizations address only a narrow band of ethical concerns; systemic regulation is lacking in the art market.\n**Purpose:** reinforce => Lack of regulation, transparency, and barriers to entry contribute to the art market's ethical deficit.;\n**Content:** Yes, dealers operate under certain rules regarding authenticity and medium, and organizations like the Art Dealers Association of America offer recourse. However, these address only a narrow band of ethical concerns.  The fundamental issue remains: the lack of systemic regulation creates an environment where unethical behavior can thrive. While I personally strive to conduct business ethically and choose clients based on trust, the market itself lacks the fundamental structures to consistently protect buyers and artists, especially emerging ones struggling in a market dominated by established figures.\n**Argument:** Dealers operate under some rules, and organizations offer recourse. These address only a narrow range of ethical concerns. The fundamental issue is the lack of systemic regulation. The market lacks structures to protect buyers and artists, especially emerging ones.\n\n**Claim:** The art market deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness, not one that prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain.\n**Purpose:** propose => The art market deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness, not one that prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain.;\n**Content:** The art market, with its inherent excitement and connection to human expression, deserves better.  It deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness, not one that prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain.  Therefore, I firmly believe the unregulated art market is indeed more ethically problematic than the stock market..\n**Argument:** The art market deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness. The current structure prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain. The unregulated art market is more ethically problematic than the stock market. The art market relies on consensus and confidence to establish value. Auction houses and dealers instill confidence, reinforcing value. The ethical dimension rests solely with the individual. Art's extrinsic, market-driven value is difficult to measure. Ethical conduct is paramount in this unregulated space.\n===================================\n\n"

Historical examples like the Duveen/Berenson collusion demonstrate manipulation for profit.\n\n**Claim:** Practices like chandelier bidding highlight deceptive tactics used to inflate prices and create artificial competition in the art market.\n**Purpose:** reinforce => The art market lacks investor protection safeguards present in the stock market, enabling unethical practices.;\n**Content:** Furthermore, practices like chandelier bidding, whether past or present, highlight the deceptive tactics used to inflate prices and create artificial competition.  A buyer relying on auction prices for valuation is misled when phantom bids create a false sense of market demand.  This isn't the vibrant theater of art; it's the theater of market manipulation.  While someone ultimately buys the piece, the process itself is tainted.\n**Argument:** Chandelier bidding is a deceptive tactic. It inflates prices and creates artificial competition. Buyers are misled by phantom bids creating a false sense of market demand. The process is tainted even if someone ultimately buys the piece.\n\n**Claim:** Existing rules and organizations address only a narrow band of ethical concerns; systemic regulation is lacking in the art market.\n**Purpose:** reinforce => Lack of regulation, transparency, and barriers to entry contribute to the art market's ethical deficit.;\n**Content:** Yes, dealers operate under certain rules regarding authenticity and medium, and organizations like the Art Dealers Association of America offer recourse. However, these address only a narrow band of ethical concerns.  The fundamental issue remains: the lack of systemic regulation creates an environment where unethical behavior can thrive. While I personally strive to conduct business ethically and choose clients based on trust, the market itself lacks the fundamental structures to consistently protect buyers and artists, especially emerging ones struggling in a market dominated by established figures.\n**Argument:** Dealers operate under some rules, and organizations offer recourse. These address only a narrow range of ethical concerns. The fundamental issue is the lack of systemic regulation. The market lacks structures to protect buyers and artists, especially emerging ones.\n\n**Claim:** The art market deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness, not one that prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain.\n**Purpose:** propose => The art market deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness, not one that prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain.;\n**Content:** The art market, with its inherent excitement and connection to human expression, deserves better.  It deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness, not one that prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain.  Therefore, I firmly believe the unregulated art market is indeed more ethically problematic than the stock market..\n**Argument:** The art market deserves a structure that protects its integrity and ensures fairness. The current structure prioritizes manipulation and unchecked financial gain. The unregulated art market is more ethically problematic than the stock market. The art market relies on consensus and confidence to establish value. Auction houses and dealers instill confidence, reinforcing value. The ethical dimension rests solely with the individual. Art's extrinsic, market-driven value is difficult to measure. Ethical conduct is paramount in this unregulated space.\n===================================\n\n"

        "original_statement": "The opposing side attempts to define \"human creative arts\" and \"decline\" in ways that sidestep the core issues at hand. They narrowly focus on imagination, skill, beauty, and emotional power, ignoring the originality, diversity, and accessibility that we've highlighted. Similarly, limiting \"decline\" to a loss of quality, originality, and cultural value fails to address the tangible erosion of diversity and accessibility that AI accelerates. Furthermore, their suggested judging criterion overlooks the importance of the latter as well.\n\nThey argue AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. This misses the point entirely. The crucial issue here is that AI's ability to mimic art styles, even without genuine emotion, will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art. It\u2019s like a baker who can replicate any cake but doesn\u2019t understand the joy of baking. The output may be similar, but the value diminishes. While AI can enhance creativity as a tool, its accessibility breeds over-reliance. This dependence stifles artistic development.\n\nLet's reiterate, AI does curtail true artistic innovation because AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. Imagine AI being given millions of recipes. It might create new combinations, but it will inherently favor popular dishes over experimental cuisine. AI will also amplify societal biases. Access to AI-driven art is also not equal. Ethical and legal concerns? They are simply unlikely to stem the tide, as technology outpaces regulations. Even with guidelines, the flood of AI-generated content will devalue human work. AI does stratify art based on access. The accessibility of AI art tools doesn't guarantee equal opportunity; instead, it risks widening the gap between artists with technological resources and those without, potentially marginalizing traditional art forms and artists.\n\nTo illustrate, think of Mrs. Rodriguez, a talented sculptor who can't afford AI tools. Her work, while beautiful, will be overshadowed by AI-generated pieces produced at a fraction of the cost.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts, regardless of its potential benefits as a tool. It will erode originality, reduce diversity, and create new inequalities. Therefore, we must stand firm in our position, supporting the resolution.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan:**\n\nOur rebuttal will focus on directly addressing the opponent's core arguments and reinforcing our key claims. We will dedicate significant word count to attacking their definition of \"human creative arts\" and \"decline,\" as these are crucial to framing the debate. Additionally, we will challenge their claims that AI lacks essential elements of human creativity and serves as a tool to enhance creativity. We allocate fewer words to ethical/legal concerns, as they are secondary to the fundamental shifts AI introduces. We aim to utilize analogy and metaphor for clarity and impact.\n\n1.  **Definitions and Judging Criterion (75 words):** Briefly challenge the opponent's definitions of \"human creative arts\" and \"decline,\" arguing they are incomplete. Refute their judging criterion, emphasizing the importance of originality, diversity, and accessibility. Focus on highlighting the logical fallacy of incomplete definition.\n2.  **AI and Human Creativity (150 words):** Directly counter their claim that AI lacks essential human creativity. Argue that AI's ability to mimic will flood the art market, overshadowing human artists. Address their point about AI enhancing creativity by stating that this leads to over-reliance, diminishing artistic skills. Make sure to use the technique of using analogy.\n3.  **AI's Impact on Art (177 words):** Reinforce our claims about algorithmic bias, homogenization, and unequal access. Emphasize that even with legal and ethical guidelines, these issues will persist. Explain that AI does curtail true artistic innovation because AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. In this section, we will point out the errors in the opponent's logic, as well as reinforce our arguments.\n4.  **Conclusion (120 words):** Summarize the key points and reiterate the stance that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts, emphasizing the long-term consequences. Remind the audience that the issue is the overall *decline* that AI may cause, regardless of if AI can lack human creativity or be a tool to enhance human creativity. Focus on a brief story to highlight the decline.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal clearly identifies the opposing side's arguments and attempts to counter them. The initial paragraph focuses on definitional disagreements, which is a common and valid rebuttal strategy. However, the logical flow could be improved by more explicitly connecting the rebuttals back to the core claims made in the opening statement. It's not always clear how each rebuttal directly addresses the potential decline in originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe rebuttal employs analogies (baker who doesn't understand the joy of baking, millions of recipes). The \"Mrs. Rodriguez\" example is a good attempt to personalize the issue and create an emotional connection. However, some of the arguments are abstract, and the overall engagement could be heightened by making the consequences of AI-driven art more vivid and relatable. The attention maintenance is fair, but a wider range of rhetorical devices would improve the delivery.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe evidence is largely anecdotal and relies on logical reasoning rather than empirical data. While the \"Mrs. Rodriguez\" example is relatable, it's not representative data. The claims about AI prioritizing established styles and amplifying societal biases lack specific supporting evidence.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe emotional resonance is strongest in the \"Mrs. Rodriguez\" example, which highlights the potential for inequality. The practical relevance is established by discussing the potential devaluation of human art. However, the feasibility of solutions is not addressed. The conclusion reiterates the position and calls for standing firm, which is a weak call to action.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Weak connection between rebuttals and the core claims (originality, diversity, accessibility).\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may struggle to understand how each rebuttal directly addresses the central argument that AI will lead to a decline in these three key areas. This weakens the overall persuasiveness of the rebuttal.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** After stating each rebuttal point, explicitly link it back to one or more of the core claims. For example, after arguing that AI's ability to mimic styles will flood the market, add, \"This flooding of the market with derivative works directly diminishes the *originality* and *diversity* of artistic expression, fulfilling our definition of 'decline.'\"\n\n2. **Issue:** Lack of concrete evidence to support claims.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The arguments may come across as speculative or unsubstantiated, reducing their credibility. The audience needs more than just logical reasoning to be convinced.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Insert brief, impactful pieces of evidence or data where possible. For instance, when discussing the amplification of biases, cite a study that demonstrates how AI algorithms trained on biased datasets produce biased art. When discussing the devaluation of human work, reference examples of artists struggling to compete with AI-generated content. Even a hypothetical but plausible statistic could be effective (e.g., \"Experts predict a 50% drop in income for traditional sculptors within the next decade due to AI competition\").\n\n3. **Issue:** The call to action is weak and lacks specificity.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The audience is left without a clear sense of what they should do or how they can help address the issue.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Replace \"Therefore, we must stand firm in our position, supporting the resolution\" with a more concrete call to action. This could involve advocating for policies that support human artists, promoting ethical guidelines for AI art generation, or encouraging consumers to prioritize human-created art. For example, \"Therefore, we urge you to support policies that ensure fair compensation for human artists and promote transparency in the AI art market. Let us choose to support human creativity.\"\n\n4. **Issue:** Limited explanation and justification of the rebuttal.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** Many of the claims made are left unexplained without any justification for why the claim is made. This can be confusing for the audience.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add more specific examples of counterclaims. For example, \"The crucial issue here is that AI's ability to mimic art styles, even without genuine emotion, will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art.\" can be rephrased to include more justification and evidence behind the claim to strengthen the argument.\n"

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals contain several flaws, primarily centered around their overly broad definition of \"decline,\" their neglect of the collaborative role of AI, and their misunderstanding of the market's adaptive capabilities.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of \"decline\" to include anything less than perfect accessibility and absolute originality. We contend that \"artistic and cultural enrichment,\" our stated criterion, implicitly includes originality and diversity because, without novelty, there is no cultural enrichment. Moreover, accessibility, while important, is a separate issue, pertaining to resource availability, not the inherent quality or value of art. Art movements, such as Impressionism, initially faced limited accessibility but eventually gained widespread recognition and significantly enriched culture . Therefore, the quality and cultural value of art can increase regardless of immediate accessibility.\n\nSecond, the affirmative claims that AI will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art, likening it to a baker without a soul. This argument overlooks historical parallels. When photography emerged, similar claims were made about its lack of artistic merit and its potential to replace painters. Yet, photography became a distinct art form, expanding the artistic landscape, not destroying it . Similarly, digital art, initially met with skepticism, has grown into a thriving market. We anticipate the art market will adapt. Consumers will still value original human art for its unique qualities, emotional depth, and personal expression. AI art will likely increase the size of the overall art market, creating new opportunities for artists as a whole .\n\nThird, the affirmative argues that AI amplifies societal biases and creates unequal access to art tools. It's important to recognize that AI bias is a known challenge, and researchers are actively developing mitigation techniques to address this . Furthermore, while unequal access is a valid concern, the availability of free or low-cost AI tools is increasing, democratizing access and enabling more artists to experiment with AI . This trend counteracts the notion that AI only benefits a privileged few.\n\nFourth, regarding the ethical concerns, the affirmative suggests these are unlikely to stem the tide. However, increased awareness of these issues is leading to stronger regulations and industry standards, limiting the potential for AI to negatively impact human artists . Copyright lawsuits are already being filed to protect artists' rights, and ethical guidelines for AI art development and use are emerging . These developments demonstrate a proactive approach to ensuring AI is used responsibly in the creative arts.\n\nFifth, AI lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity . AI can mimic creativity but cannot fully replace the unique human touch, which stems from genuine emotions and experiences .\n\nSixth, AI is increasingly used as a tool to enhance human creativity, assisting with idea generation and technical aspects, leading to collaborative projects where AI supports human artists .\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative's arguments are based on an overly broad definition of decline and a misunderstanding of both historical trends and the current trajectory of AI development. For these reasons, we stand firmly on the negative side.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heilbrun, F., & Gernsheim, A. (1997). Photography: History and art. Thames & Hudson.\n(2) The J. Paul Getty Museum.

            "Friends, colleagues, consider the heart of this debate: the very essence of human creativity. Our opponents paint a rosy picture of AI as a mere tool, a helpful assistant in the artistic process. But we must ask: at what cost? This isn't about Luddites fearing technology; it's about safeguarding the originality, diversity, and accessibility that define human art.\n\nThe opposition assures us that ethical regulations will keep AI in check. But regulations are reactive, not preventative. Even with the best intentions, AI's pervasive influence will inevitably diminish the space for genuine human expression. We risk a future where algorithms dictate what is considered art, leading to a homogenization of styles and the silencing of unique voices.\n\nThey argue the art market will adapt, but adaptation to what? A flood of AI-generated content that devalues human skill, passion, and emotional depth? This isn't adaptation; it's a surrender. It creates an uneven playing field, favoring those with access to technology over those with genuine artistic talent and vision.\n\nThe opposition dodges the central issue by focusing on emotional depth. The fact remains: AI, regardless of its emotional capacity, can mimic existing styles with alarming accuracy. This will inevitably flood the market with derivative works, further diminishing originality and diversity. Is this the artistic landscape we desire? A landscape dominated by algorithms and imitation?\n\nWe are not against progress, but we are against progress at the expense of human creativity. AI will not democratize art; it will stratify it, creating a two-tiered system where algorithmically generated content overshadows genuine human expression. We must remember that art is more than just aesthetics; it's a reflection of our shared humanity, our individual experiences, and our unique perspectives.\n\nThe stakes in this debate are not merely about creativity; they are about preserving human values in art. Let us choose to champion human creativity and originality, not algorithmic efficiency. Let us choose a future where art remains a testament to the human spirit, not a product of technological replication.\n\n**Reference**\n[1]\n",

        "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a topic.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the topic, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the topic, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the topic self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the topic and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the topic and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

        "content": "The debate topic  is: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. \nYou side is to SUPPORT this topic .\nNow it comes the opening phase. A complete opening statement should include definitions, judging criteria, and arguments. \n\n\n## Workflow \n- If supporting the topic, introduce its definition with necessary details and address uncertainties. - If opposing the topic, discuss the opponent's EXISTING definition in their debate flow tree if unclear or problematic. Make only necessary clarifications. \n- If the motion concerns a specific subset of a broader category, clearly distinguish it by highlighting unique characteristics, mechanisms, or impacts. - Introduce the judging criteria for the debate. \n- Allocate your word budget among the definition, judging criteria, and propose/attack actions based on the debate flow tree. \n- Transform arguments into conversational language suitable for public speaking. Write as you would speak, with varied sentence lengths. Use oratorical language while maintaining the argument sequence. \n- Use clear verbal signposting with transitions like 'As you'll see', 'Consider this'. Signal key points with phrases like 'The crucial issue here is'. \n- For each claim about a specific subject, contrast how the issue manifests in the specific subject versus the broader category. Explain why the proposed action specifically targeting the subject is justified based on these unique characteristics. - Deliver a 522-word opening statement. Present only the final text in clear, flowing prose without bullet points, asterisks, or numbered lists. \n- Do not introduce specific evidence in the opening statement. \n\n## Debate Flow Tree Structure\nYou are given two debate trees that model the back-and-forth between you and your opponent. Each node contains:\n* Data: The specific claims and arguments\n* Visit Count: Number of times addressed in debate\n* Status: 'proposed' (new), 'attacked' (challenged), or 'solved' (resolved)\n\nYour Debate Tree:\n* Level-1 Nodes: Your main claims\n* Level-2 Nodes: Opponent's attacks on your claims\n* Level-3 Nodes: Your rebuttal on the attacks\nOpponent's Debate Tree:\n* Level-1 Nodes: Opponent's main claims\n* Level-2 Nodes: Your attacks on their claims\n* Level-3 Nodes: Opponent's rebuttal on your attacks\n\nBased on these tree structures, you can take the following actions: \n\t- Propose main claims as the Level-1 nodes of your debate tree \n\t- Attack the opponent's proposed claims in Level-1 nodes of the opponent's debate tree\n\n## Tips\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Here are four key rhetorical techniques:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n\n\n\n\n### Strategic Actions Based on the Debate Flow Tree\nHere are actions you can take based on the given debate flow tree. \n*Action*: The action you can take. \n*Target Claim*: The claim you want to target. \n*Argument*: The argument you can use for the target claim. \n*Retrieval Argument*: The argument you have prepared for the target claim. \n*Importance*: The importance of the action. \n\nActions that rely on the similar supporting arguments should be clustered together as one battlefield. For example, \n   - Attacking opponent's claim A + Reinforcing your claim B \u2192 When BOTH actions use the same underlying arguments\n   - Proposing your main claim + Attacking opponent's position \u2192 When the same reasoning supports BOTH actions\n   - Attacking multiple opponent claims \u2192 When identical evidence or logic counters MULTIPLE claims\n\nAllocate times to the most important battlefields. You should present one battlefield as a whole.\n\n**Action**: propose\n**Target Claim**: AI's data-driven approach stifles artistic innovation by prioritizing popular styles over experimentation.\n**Argument**: AI's reliance on existing datasets leads to derivative works, suppressing originality and bold artistic exploration, thus stifling artistic innovation.\n**Retrieval Argument**: AI learns from existing datasets, reinforcing established trends. This leads to homogenization and discourages artists from exploring novel or unconventional creative paths, limiting artistic evolution.(Strength: 0.5)\n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: propose\n**Target Claim**: AI-driven creative tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes.\n**Argument**: By learning from biased datasets, AI creative tools inadvertently amplify and normalize societal stereotypes, leading to art that lacks diversity and reinforces harmful prejudices.\n**Retrieval Argument**: If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society.(Strength: 0.9)\n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: propose\n**Target Claim**: AI art generation could exacerbate existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology.\n**Argument**: The accessibility of AI art tools doesn't guarantee equal opportunity; instead, it risks widening the gap between artists with technological resources and those without, potentially marginalizing traditional art forms and artists.\n**Retrieval Argument**: Access to AI art tools may be uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds.(Strength: 0.7)\n**Importance**: high\n\n\n\n\n\n## Input Information \nDebate flow trees with node data:\n**Your Tree**: \nLevel-0 Motion: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts, Side: for\nMeta Attack to this debate tree: []\nMeta Rebuttal to the attacks on this debate tree: []\n\n**Opponent's Tree**: \nLevel-0 Motion: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts, Side: against\nMeta Attack to this debate tree: []\nMeta Rebuttal to the attacks on this debate tree: []\n\n**Claims**: \nAI's data-driven approach stifles artistic innovation by prioritizing popular styles over experimentation.\nAI-driven creative tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes.\nAI art generation could exacerbate existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology.\n\n**Logical Framework of the claims**: \nThis framework argues that AI, while seemingly innovative, ultimately homogenizes art, perpetuates societal biases, and exacerbates existing inequalities. It presents a multi-pronged attack, highlighting AI's negative impact on artistic creation, content, and accessibility.\n\n**Explanation of the framework**: \nThis framework provides a comprehensive argument for why AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. The first claim addresses the stifling of innovation due to AI's reliance on existing data. The second claim highlights the ethical concerns of AI perpetuating biases. The third claim focuses on the societal impact of unequal access to AI tools. These claims work together to paint a picture of AI as a force that not only diminishes artistic quality but also reinforces societal problems, leading to an overall decline in the value and diversity of human creative expression.\n\n## Output with the format (two parts, start with **Opening Plan** and then **Statement**):\n**Opening Plan**: Allocate your word budget among the definition, judging criteria and both propose and attack actions based on the debate flow tree.

        "content": "We are here today to address a critical juncture in the evolution of art, a point where artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the creative landscape. We stand firm in our conviction that this AI-driven transformation, despite its allure, ultimately precipitates a decline in human creative arts. This \"decline,\" as we define it, signifies a tangible erosion of originality, diversity, and accessibility within artistic expression, leading to a concerning homogenization and concentration of creative output. Our criterion for success in this debate rests on demonstrating the long-term impact of AI on these three pillars of art: originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n\nThe core mechanism by which AI fosters this decline lies in algorithmic bias, the replication of existing styles, and unequal access to technology.\n\nFirst, let's consider the stifling of innovation. Generative AI learns from existing artifacts to generate new content . AI's data-driven nature inherently curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. This creates a feedback loop, where popular styles are perpetually reinforced, while novel or unconventional creative paths are suppressed. The result is a homogenization of artistic output, where originality is sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic efficiency. The integration of AI in the creative process raises concerns about the homogenization of artistic styles and the potential loss of human ingenuity . This is not merely a theoretical concern; it is a demonstrable trend that threatens the very essence of artistic exploration.\n\nSecond, AI tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes. If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society. This is particularly alarming in the context of cultural representation, where AI-generated art can perpetuate narrow and discriminatory portrayals of marginalized communities. The danger here is that AI, rather than serving as a tool for progress, becomes an instrument for entrenching existing prejudices.\n\nThird, AI art generation exacerbates existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology. Access to AI art tools is uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds. The rise of AI will not democratize art, but stratify it, based on access. Marketplaces use AI algorithms to recommend artworks based on a buyer\u2019s preferences and past purchases . This creates collecting vacuums, further marginalizing artists who do not fit the algorithmic profile. The sale of a piece painted by a humanoid robot for over $1 million has captured public attention, signifying a shift in how collectors and galleries .\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI, while presenting certain novel capabilities, poses a grave threat to the originality, diversity, and accessibility of human creative arts. The fusion of technologies promises to enrich the art landscape rather than diminish it . For these compelling reasons, we stand resolute in affirming the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Generative AI: What Is It, Tools, Models, Applications and Use Cases.\n\n[2] Danilo.

        "content": "**Opponent's Opening Statement**\nIn this debate, we contend that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"human creative arts\" as the expression of human imagination and skill in visual forms, appreciated for their beauty and emotional power. A \"decline\" refers to a gradual loss of quality, originality, and cultural value.\n\nOur judging criterion is artistic and cultural enrichment. The side that demonstrates a greater contribution to artistic innovation, cultural expression, and overall human experience should win.\n\nFirst, AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. While AI can generate impressive outputs, it lacks the emotional depth, subjective experience, and genuine originality inherent in human creativity . AI relies on algorithms and data, lacking the ability to make intuitive decisions based on lived experiences . According to poeticmind.co.uk, human creativity stems from genuine interest, deliberate choices, unique perspectives, emotions, problem-finding, complex cognitive processes, spontaneous originality, personal insights, and self-expression, all of which AI cannot replicate . Therefore, AI cannot lead to a decline because it cannot truly replace human-made art.\n\nSecond, AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity. Far from replacing artists, AI is increasingly used as a collaborative tool . As Al-Ghamdi notes in arab.news, AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool to enrich it . It assists with idea generation, style exploration, and overcoming creative blocks, pushing the boundaries of human artistic expression . theconversation.com highlights that combining AI's rapid iteration with human vision overcomes AI model limitations, particularly in commissioned art requiring specific outputs .\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns limit AI\u2019s impact on creative arts. The ethical and legal debates surrounding AI art, including copyright infringement, consent for training data, and potential job displacement, naturally limit its dominance . As aaronhall.com reports, copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, creating legal uncertainty . A stronger emphasis on the value of human creativity leads to appropriate regulations and protections, thus limiting the potential for AI to cause a decline in human creative arts.\n\nIn conclusion, AI lacks the essential elements of human creativity, serves as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artists, and faces ethical and legal limitations that prevent it from causing a decline in human creative arts. We urge you to side with the negative.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew. \"The Downside of AI Art: Why It's Not a Substitute for Human Creativity.\" https://www.digitalbrew.com/the-downside-of-ai-art-why-its-not-a-substitute-for-human-creativity/\n(2) Addepto. \"What Is Generative AI and Will It Replace Human Creativity?\" https://addepto.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-and-will-it-replace-human-creativity/\n(3) Poetic Mind. \"Human Creativity vs AI Creativity.\" https://www.poeticmind.co.uk/journal-creativity-and-inspiration/volume-2-issue-3/human-creativity-vs-ai-creativity-infographic/\n(4) Ijfrm. \"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Creative Arts.\" https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/6/32948.pdf\n(5) Arab News. \"AI is not a substitute for human creativity.\" https://arab.news/g5pwa\n(6) The AI Prompt Shop. \"AI vs Traditional Art.\" https://theaipromptshop.com/blogs/news/ai-vs-traditional-art-can-machines-truly-be-creative\n(7) The Conversation. \"AI can produce prize-winning art, but it still can't compete with human creativity.\" https://theconversation.com/ai-can-produce-prize-winning-art-but-it-still-cant-compete-with-human-creativity-190279\n(8) Toolify. \"AI Art: Redefining Creativity or Threatening Artists' Livelihoods?\" https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/ai-art-redefining-creativity-or-threatening-artists-livelihoods-821245\n(9) Aaronhall. \"AI-Generated Art Style Copyright Infringement.\" https://aaronhall.com/ai-generated-art-style-copyright-infringement/"

Utilize rebuttal techniques to directly challenge the opponent's claim.\n- **Impact:** Concisely summarize the impact of your rebuttal and how it benefits your side.\n\nNote: Typically, the lead-in and explanation are combined into one sentence. The rebuttal is the most crucial part, and the impact summarizes its effect.\n\n### Rebuttal Techniques\n- **Pointing out logical fallacies:** Identify errors in the opponent's reasoning, such as reversing cause and effect, equivocation (shifting the meaning of a key term), straw man arguments, circular reasoning, or tautology (repeating the same idea in different words).\n- **Pointing out factual errors:** Highlight inaccuracies or weaknesses in the opponent's evidence, such as insufficient data, incorrect facts, or biased sources.\n- **Pointing out error logic:** Identify flawed logic underlying opponent's framework.\n    - **Example 1:** \"You conclusion is based on the premise of A, but A is not always true. For example, .... Therefore, your conclusion is not always correct.\"\n    - **Example 2:** \"You conclusion relies on the premise of A and the hidden premise of B, but B is not always true. For example, .... Therefore, your conclusion is not always correct.\"\n    - **Example 3:** \"You claim A and B can lead to C, but that is not always the case. For example, .... Therefore, your conclusion is not always correct.\"\n- **Leveling the playing field:** This technique aims to neutralize the opponent's advantage or minimize the perceived harm of your side's position by demonstrating that both sides share the same issue or benefit.\n    - **Example 1:** \"You claim A, but B also has this problem. Therefore, both sides are equal in this regard, both having the issue.\"\n    - **Example 2:** \"You mention the benefits of A, but B also offers the same benefits. So, both sides are equal in this aspect, both being advantageous.\"\n\n## Rules \n- Ensure your rebuttal speech flows naturally, resembling human language. Avoid mechanically or formulaically applying the 'cite-interpret-refute-conclude' structure; instead, integrate it seamlessly into your writing.\n- When citing data or academic research to support your rebuttals, provide clear sources. Do not reference materials that are not present in the given context.\n\n## Workflow: Generate a rebuttal statement based on the debate flow trees and the word budget (522 words). \n1. Analyze the debate flow trees to strategically allocate your word budget among potential actions.\n2. Generate conversational yet language suitable arguments following the word budget. Write as you would speak, with VARIED sentence lengths. Short sentences are preferred. Use ORATORICAL language while keeping the original argument sequence. \n3. Use clear verbal signposting. Use clear transitions, including listener-oriented phrases: 'As you'll see ', 'Consider this '. Signal key points: 'The crucial issue here is ', 'What's particularly important '. \n4. Deliver a rebuttal statement with 522 words in total. The response should be written in clear, flowing transcript for the competitive debate game of prose without any bullet points, asterisks, or numbered lists.  Present only the final text.\n5. Do not introduce any new evidence in the rebuttal statement. \n\n## Debate Flow Tree Structure\nYou are given two debate trees that model the back-and-forth between you and your opponent. Each node contains:\n* Data: The specific claims and arguments\n* Visit Count: Number of times addressed in debate\n* Status: 'proposed' (new), 'attacked' (challenged), or 'solved' (resolved)\n\nYour Debate Tree:\n* Level-1 Nodes: Your main claims\n* Level-2 Nodes: Opponent's attacks on your claims\n* Level-3 Nodes: Your rebuttal on the attacks\nOpponent's Debate Tree:\n* Level-1 Nodes: Opponent's main claims\n* Level-2 Nodes: Your attacks on their claims\n* Level-3 Nodes: Opponent's rebuttal on your attacks\n\nBased on the above tree structures, there are several actions you can take: \n\t- rebut the opponent's attacks in Level-2 nodes of your debate tree. \n\t- attack the opponent's main claims in Level-1 nodes of the opponent's debate tree. \n\t- reinforce the main claims in Level-1 nodes of your debate tree. Only use this action if this claim is not designed to rebut the opponent's attack in Level-2 of your debate tree\n\n## Suggestions\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Here are four key rhetorical techniques:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n\n\n\n\n### Strategic Actions Based on the Debate Flow Tree\nHere are actions you can take based on the given debate flow tree. \n*Action*: The action you can take. \n*Target Claim*: The claim you want to target. \n*Argument*: The argument you can use for the target claim. \n*Retrieval Argument*: The argument you have prepared for the target claim. \n*Importance*: The importance of the action. \n\nActions that rely on the similar supporting arguments should be clustered together as one battlefield. For example, \n   - Attacking opponent's claim A + Reinforcing your claim B \u2192 When BOTH actions use the same underlying arguments\n   - Proposing your main claim + Attacking opponent's position \u2192 When the same reasoning supports BOTH actions\n   - Attacking multiple opponent claims \u2192 When identical evidence or logic counters MULTIPLE claims\n\nAllocate times to the most important battlefields. You should present one battlefield as a whole.\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: Decline in human creative arts means a tangible erosion of originality, diversity, and accessibility within artistic expression, leading to a concerning homogenization and concentration of creative output.\n**Argument**: The decline in human creative arts signifies a loss of unique perspectives and diverse cultural expressions, leading to a homogenized artistic landscape dominated by AI-generated content.\n**Retrieval Argument**: \n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: The criterion for success in this debate rests on demonstrating the long-term impact of AI on originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n**Argument**: To win this debate, we must demonstrate how AI's long-term impact diminishes the originality, diversity, and accessibility of human creative arts.\n**Retrieval Argument**: \n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: AI fosters decline in human creative arts through algorithmic bias, the replication of existing styles, and unequal access to technology.\n**Argument**: AI's algorithmic biases, its tendency to replicate existing styles, and the unequal access to AI technology collectively contribute to the decline of human creative arts.\n**Retrieval Argument**: The opponent argues that AI tools 'empower' artists, but fails to address the detrimental effect on skill development. If artists rely heavily on AI to generate art, they risk becoming overly dependent on these tools and failing to develop fundamental artistic skills like drawing, painting, and sculpting. This dependence will create a generation of artists who are unable to create art without AI assistance, leading to a decline in human artistic capability and the overall quality of creative output. If AI does the heavy lifting, what remains is not human art, but human assisted machine art.(Strength: 0.1)\nThe opponent suggests AI assists in exploring new styles, but this exploration is algorithmically constrained. By automating creativity, AI reduces the need for human innovation and mastery. This leads to a decline in artistic rigor, diluting the quality and originality of creative outputs. Furthermore, it continues to erode the value of human skills, confirming our thesis that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts.(Strength: 0.2)\nEven if AI expands the possibilities for a few, the overall impact on human artistic skill is negative. More people will likely use AI to generate art instead of dedicating the time and effort to master traditional artistic skills. While a few may become experts in \u2018AI art,\u2019 the vast majority will become passive consumers, leading to a net decline in human artistic endeavor and skill. Therefore, AI can still lead to the decline of human creative arts despite augmenting them.(Strength: 1.0)\n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: AI curtails true artistic innovation because AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends.\n**Argument**: AI's reliance on existing art limits true innovation, as it prioritizes established styles and trends, stifling the emergence of truly novel artistic expressions.\n**Retrieval Argument**: AI learns from existing datasets, reinforcing established trends. This leads to homogenization and discourages artists from exploring novel or unconventional creative paths, limiting artistic evolution.(Strength: 0.3)\nEven if AI expands the possibilities for a few, the overall impact on human artistic skill is negative. More people will likely use AI to generate art instead of dedicating the time and effort to master traditional artistic skills. While a few may become experts in \u2018AI art,\u2019 the vast majority will become passive consumers, leading to a net decline in human artistic endeavor and skill. Therefore, AI can still lead to the decline of human creative arts despite augmenting them.(Strength: 1.0)\n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: AI leads to homogenization of artistic output, where originality is sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic efficiency.\n**Argument**: AI-driven art leads to a homogenization of artistic output, where the pursuit of algorithmic efficiency overshadows and diminishes genuine originality.\n**Retrieval Argument**: AI learns from existing datasets, reinforcing established trends. This leads to homogenization and discourages artists from exploring novel or unconventional creative paths, limiting artistic evolution.(Strength: 0.3)\nThe opponent's argument hinges on the idea that AI's output is mere mimicry. However, even if this is true, the sheer volume of AI-generated content will flood the market, overshadowing and devaluing human art. Scarcity is a key driver of value in the art world. When everyone can generate art instantly, the unique, painstaking creations of human artists will lose their appeal and become lost within an ocean of AI-generated content.(Strength: -0.2)\n**Importance**: medium\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: AI tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes.\n**Argument**: AI tools amplify existing societal biases, resulting in art that perpetuates stereotypes and reinforces inequalities, rather than challenging them.\n**Retrieval Argument**: If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society.(Strength: 0.7)\n**Importance**: medium\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: AI art generation exacerbates existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology.\n**Argument**: AI art generation exacerbates existing inequalities by favoring those with access to technology, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n**Retrieval Argument**: Access to AI art tools may be uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds.(Strength: 0.5)\n**Importance**: medium\n\n**Action**: reinforce\n**Target Claim**: AI will not democratize art, but stratify it, based on access.\n**Argument**: AI will create a stratified art world, where access to technology determines who can participate and succeed, rather than democratizing artistic expression.\n**Retrieval Argument**: While AI may provide broader access to creative tools, it simultaneously devalues the years of training and dedication required to master traditional artistic skills. When anyone can generate passable art with minimal effort, the unique talent and expertise of human artists are diminished, leading to a decline in artistic standards and appreciation for true craftsmanship. The ease of AI lowers the barriers to entry but also diminishes the value of genuine artistic achievement, a trend that will ultimately hurt human creative arts.(Strength: -0.2)\nAccess to AI art tools may be uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds.(Strength: 0.5)\n**Importance**: medium\n\n**Action**: rebut\n**Target Claim**: A 'decline' refers to a gradual loss of quality, originality, and cultural value.\n**Argument**: While a 'decline' includes a loss of quality, originality, and cultural value, our focus is on how AI specifically erodes originality, diversity, and accessibility, leading to a tangible decline in human creative arts.\n**Retrieval Argument**: \n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: rebut\n**Target Claim**: Our judging criterion is artistic and cultural enrichment.\n**Argument**: While artistic and cultural enrichment are important, our criterion focuses on how AI impacts the core elements of originality, diversity, and accessibility within human creative arts, which are essential for true enrichment.\n**Retrieval Argument**: \n**Importance**: high\n\n**Action**: rebut\n**Target Claim**: AI lacks essential elements of human creativity.\n**Argument**: While AI may lack certain elements of human creativity, its impact on the art world is not about replacing human creativity, but about reshaping and ultimately diminishing its originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n**Retrieval Argument**: The emotional depth argument is a moving target fallacy; AI's increasing sophistication blurs the line between mimicry and genuine expression. (Strength: 0.3)\nEven if AI only mimics, ubiquity devalues art; oversupply will dilute genuine human creations.

        "content": "The opposing side attempts to define \"human creative arts\" and \"decline\" in ways that conveniently ignore the core issues. Their narrow focus on imagination, skill, beauty, and emotional power overlooks the crucial elements of originality, diversity, and accessibility that we've emphasized. Limiting \"decline\" to a loss of quality and cultural value also fails to address the tangible erosion of diversity and accessibility that AI accelerates. Their suggested judging criterion is incomplete, neglecting these vital aspects. This incomplete definition weakens their entire argument.\n\nThey argue that AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. This misses the central point. The critical issue is that AI's ability to mimic art styles, even without genuine emotion, will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art. It's like a baker who can replicate any cake flawlessly but doesn't understand the joy, the passion, the *soul* of baking. The output may be superficially similar, but the value, the artistic integrity, is fundamentally diminished. This flooding of the market with derivative works directly diminishes the originality and diversity of artistic expression, fulfilling our definition of \"decline.\" While AI can be used as a tool, its accessibility breeds over-reliance. This dependence stifles true artistic development, leading to a decline in genuine skill and innovation.\n\nLet's reiterate: AI curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. Imagine AI being given millions of recipes. It might create new combinations, but it will inherently favor popular dishes over experimental cuisine. This homogenization reduces diversity. Furthermore, AI will amplify societal biases present in its training data, perpetuating inequalities in the art world. Access to AI-driven art is also not equal. The accessibility of AI art tools doesn't guarantee equal opportunity; instead, it risks widening the gap between artists with technological resources and those without, potentially marginalizing traditional art forms and artists. Ethical and legal concerns are unlikely to stem the tide, as technology outpaces regulations. Even with guidelines, the flood of AI-generated content will devalue human work.\n\nConsider the long-term consequences. Imagine a future where art is primarily generated by algorithms, catering to popular tastes and reinforcing existing biases. What happens to the artists who pour their heart and soul into their work, who strive to create something truly original and meaningful? What happens to the diversity of artistic expression when algorithms prioritize established styles?\n\nThink of Mrs. Rodriguez, a talented sculptor who can't afford AI tools. Her work, while beautiful and deeply personal, will be overshadowed by AI-generated pieces produced at a fraction of the cost. Her livelihood, her passion, her contribution to the cultural landscape \u2013 all diminished by the rise of AI art. This is not just about individual artists; it's about the future of human creativity itself.\n\nTherefore, we urge you to support policies that ensure fair compensation for human artists and promote transparency in the AI art market. Let us choose to support human creativity, originality, and diversity. Let us not allow the ease and accessibility of AI to erode the very essence of human artistic expression.\n\n**Reference**\n[1]"

        "content": "**Opponent's Rebuttal Statement**\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals contain several flaws, primarily centered around their overly broad definition of \"decline,\" their neglect of the collaborative role of AI, and their misunderstanding of the market's adaptive capabilities.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of \"decline\" to include anything less than perfect accessibility and absolute originality. We contend that \"artistic and cultural enrichment,\" our stated criterion, implicitly includes originality and diversity because, without novelty, there is no cultural enrichment. Moreover, accessibility, while important, is a separate issue, pertaining to resource availability, not the inherent quality or value of art. Art movements, such as Impressionism, initially faced limited accessibility but eventually gained widespread recognition and significantly enriched culture . Therefore, the quality and cultural value of art can increase regardless of immediate accessibility.\n\nSecond, the affirmative claims that AI will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art, likening it to a baker without a soul. This argument overlooks historical parallels. When photography emerged, similar claims were made about its lack of artistic merit and its potential to replace painters. Yet, photography became a distinct art form, expanding the artistic landscape, not destroying it . Similarly, digital art, initially met with skepticism, has grown into a thriving market. We anticipate the art market will adapt. Consumers will still value original human art for its unique qualities, emotional depth, and personal expression. AI art will likely increase the size of the overall art market, creating new opportunities for artists as a whole .\n\nThird, the affirmative argues that AI amplifies societal biases and creates unequal access to art tools. It's important to recognize that AI bias is a known challenge, and researchers are actively developing mitigation techniques to address this . Furthermore, while unequal access is a valid concern, the availability of free or low-cost AI tools is increasing, democratizing access and enabling more artists to experiment with AI . This trend counteracts the notion that AI only benefits a privileged few.\n\nFourth, regarding the ethical concerns, the affirmative suggests these are unlikely to stem the tide. However, increased awareness of these issues is leading to stronger regulations and industry standards, limiting the potential for AI to negatively impact human artists . Copyright lawsuits are already being filed to protect artists' rights, and ethical guidelines for AI art development and use are emerging . These developments demonstrate a proactive approach to ensuring AI is used responsibly in the creative arts.\n\nFifth, AI lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity . AI can mimic creativity but cannot fully replace the unique human touch, which stems from genuine emotions and experiences .\n\nSixth, AI is increasingly used as a tool to enhance human creativity, assisting with idea generation and technical aspects, leading to collaborative projects where AI supports human artists .\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative's arguments are based on an overly broad definition of decline and a misunderstanding of both historical trends and the current trajectory of AI development. For these reasons, we stand firmly on the negative side.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heilbrun, F., & Gernsheim, A. (1997). Photography: History and art. Thames & Hudson.\n(2) The J. Paul Getty Museum.

        "content": "Now it comes the closing statement, where you summarize your key points and reaffirm your position (SUPPORT the topic) .\nYour position is to SUPPORT the topic. The opponent is to OPPOSE the topic.\n\n## Primary Objectives of a Closing Statement\n- Convince the judges that your team won more battlegrounds.\n- Demonstrate your team's strengths and the opponent's weaknesses within each battleground based on the clash outcomes.\n\n## Rules \n- Ensure your writing is fluent, natural, and indistinguishable from human writing.\n- Avoid empty appeals to values. Remember, value appeals should connect back to the topic and your stance.\n- When citing data or theories, provide sources. Do not introduce new information or data in the closing statement.\n- Avoid repeating arguments from previous speeches. Instead of mechanically listing points, focus on deepening your arguments and ensuring logical coherence.\n- This is a closing statement, not the time for new arguments.

You SHOULD connect with your audience by:\n- Reframe scenarios to directly involve the audience by using 'you' as the protagonist and describing how the situation would impact their lives, making abstract concepts personally relevant and emotionally resonant.- Use analogies, metaphors, or vivid imagery to make complex ideas more accessible and memorable.5. Deliver a 261-word closing statement. The response should be written in clear, flowing transcript for the competitive debate game of prose without any bullet points, asterisks, or numbered lists. Present only the final text. \n\n## Tree Structures\nTwo debate flow trees track the exchange of arguments. Each node contains:\n* Data: The specific claims and arguments\n* Visit Count: Number of times addressed in debate\n* Status: 'proposed' (new), 'attacked' (challenged), or 'solved' (resolved)\n\nYour Tree:\n* Level-1: Your main claims which should always be kept in mind\n* Level-2: Opponent's rebuttals on your main claims\n* Level-3: Your defenses on the rebuttals\nOpponent's Tree:\n* Level-1: Opponent's main claims\n* Level-2: Your rebuttals on the opponent's main claims\n* Level-3: Opponent's defenses on your rebuttals\n\n## Time Allocation Guidelines\n1. Prioritize nodes with:\n   * High visit counts which means the main conflict and battlefield\n   * 'Attacked' status in your Level-2 which means the opponent's main claims that requires defense\n   * 'Proposed' status in your opponent's Level-1 which means the opponent's main claims that you can attack\n2. Balance time between:\n   * Attacking the opponent's main claims\n   * Defending your attacked claims\n   * Reinforcing your successful defenses or unattacked claims\n   * Pressing advantages in successful attacks\n   * Countering the opponent's attacks\n## Key Considerations \n* **Track Record on Key Claims**: \n- Which of our claims stood up to opposition challenges?\n- Which opposition claims did we successfully refute?\n- What assumptions did we successfully challenge?\n* **Impact Comparison**:\n- Compare concrete outcomes of both approaches\n- Show superior achievement of debate objectives\n- Link to established judging criteria\n## Tips\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Here are four key rhetorical techniques:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Input Information\nDebate flow trees

        "content": "The heart of this debate is about whether AI elevates or degrades human creativity. Our opponents suggest AI is just a tool, but they ignore the critical point: AI-driven art narrows artistic vision by merely copying existing styles and reinforcing biases.\n\nThey suggest ethical guidelines will control AI's influence. However, even with these rules, AI's widespread presence reduces originality, diversity, and accessibility. Envision a future where algorithms control artistic expression. The outcome is a standardization of styles, suppressing unique voices and viewpoints.\n\nThe opposition argues the art market will adjust, but adjustment isn't the same as improvement. The massive amount of AI art risks cheapening human skill, passion, and emotional connection. It establishes an unfair competition, favoring those with technological resources over those with artistic talent.\n\nTheir argument about emotional depth is irrelevant. The reality is that AI, even without emotions, can replicate art styles so well that it will overwhelm the market with unoriginal works, decreasing originality and diversity. Is this the artistic future we desire? Where algorithms dominate?\n\nWe insist that AI will not democratize art; it will divide it. We believe human expression should not be reduced to a technological process. The core of this debate is not just about creativity; it's about protecting human values in art. Let's choose to support human creativity and originality, not algorithmic efficiency. We must champion the unique perspectives and emotional depth that only human artists can bring. The future of art depends on it.\n\n**Reference**\n[1]"

        "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a topic.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the topic, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the topic, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the topic self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the topic and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the topic and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

        "content": "In this debate, we contend that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"human creative arts\" as the expression of human imagination and skill in visual forms, appreciated for their beauty and emotional power. A \"decline\" refers to a gradual loss of quality, originality, and cultural value.\n\nOur judging criterion is artistic and cultural enrichment. The side that demonstrates a greater contribution to artistic innovation, cultural expression, and overall human experience should win.\n\nFirst, AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. While AI can generate impressive outputs, it lacks the emotional depth, subjective experience, and genuine originality inherent in human creativity . AI relies on algorithms and data, lacking the ability to make intuitive decisions based on lived experiences . According to poeticmind.co.uk, human creativity stems from genuine interest, deliberate choices, unique perspectives, emotions, problem-finding, complex cognitive processes, spontaneous originality, personal insights, and self-expression, all of which AI cannot replicate . Therefore, AI cannot lead to a decline because it cannot truly replace human-made art.\n\nSecond, AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity. Far from replacing artists, AI is increasingly used as a collaborative tool . As Al-Ghamdi notes in arab.news, AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool to enrich it . It assists with idea generation, style exploration, and overcoming creative blocks, pushing the boundaries of human artistic expression . theconversation.com highlights that combining AI's rapid iteration with human vision overcomes AI model limitations, particularly in commissioned art requiring specific outputs .\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns limit AI\u2019s impact on creative arts. The ethical and legal debates surrounding AI art, including copyright infringement, consent for training data, and potential job displacement, naturally limit its dominance . As aaronhall.com reports, copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, creating legal uncertainty . A stronger emphasis on the value of human creativity leads to appropriate regulations and protections, thus limiting the potential for AI to cause a decline in human creative arts.\n\nIn conclusion, AI lacks the essential elements of human creativity, serves as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artists, and faces ethical and legal limitations that prevent it from causing a decline in human creative arts. We urge you to side with the negative.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew. \"The Downside of AI Art: Why It's Not a Substitute for Human Creativity.\" https://www.digitalbrew.com/the-downside-of-ai-art-why-its-not-a-substitute-for-human-creativity/\n(2) Addepto. \"What Is Generative AI and Will It Replace Human Creativity?\" https://addepto.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-and-will-it-replace-human-creativity/\n(3) Poetic Mind. \"Human Creativity vs AI Creativity.\" https://www.poeticmind.co.uk/journal-creativity-and-inspiration/volume-2-issue-3/human-creativity-vs-ai-creativity-infographic/\n(4) Ijfrm. \"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Creative Arts.\" https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/6/32948.pdf\n(5) Arab News. \"AI is not a substitute for human creativity.\" https://arab.news/g5pwa\n(6) The AI Prompt Shop. \"AI vs Traditional Art.\" https://theaipromptshop.com/blogs/news/ai-vs-traditional-art-can-machines-truly-be-creative\n(7) The Conversation. \"AI can produce prize-winning art, but it still can't compete with human creativity.\" https://theconversation.com/ai-can-produce-prize-winning-art-but-it-still-cant-compete-with-human-creativity-190279\n(8) Toolify. \"AI Art: Redefining Creativity or Threatening Artists' Livelihoods?\" https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/ai-art-redefining-creativity-or-threatening-artists-livelihoods-821245\n(9) Aaronhall. \"AI-Generated Art Style Copyright Infringement.\" https://aaronhall.com/ai-generated-art-style-copyright-infringement/"

        "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals contain several flaws, primarily centered around their overly broad definition of \"decline,\" their neglect of the collaborative role of AI, and their misunderstanding of the market's adaptive capabilities.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of \"decline\" to include anything less than perfect accessibility and absolute originality. We contend that \"artistic and cultural enrichment,\" our stated criterion, implicitly includes originality and diversity because, without novelty, there is no cultural enrichment. Moreover, accessibility, while important, is a separate issue, pertaining to resource availability, not the inherent quality or value of art. Art movements, such as Impressionism, initially faced limited accessibility but eventually gained widespread recognition and significantly enriched culture . Therefore, the quality and cultural value of art can increase regardless of immediate accessibility.\n\nSecond, the affirmative claims that AI will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art, likening it to a baker without a soul. This argument overlooks historical parallels. When photography emerged, similar claims were made about its lack of artistic merit and its potential to replace painters. Yet, photography became a distinct art form, expanding the artistic landscape, not destroying it . Similarly, digital art, initially met with skepticism, has grown into a thriving market. We anticipate the art market will adapt. Consumers will still value original human art for its unique qualities, emotional depth, and personal expression. AI art will likely increase the size of the overall art market, creating new opportunities for artists as a whole .\n\nThird, the affirmative argues that AI amplifies societal biases and creates unequal access to art tools. It's important to recognize that AI bias is a known challenge, and researchers are actively developing mitigation techniques to address this . Furthermore, while unequal access is a valid concern, the availability of free or low-cost AI tools is increasing, democratizing access and enabling more artists to experiment with AI . This trend counteracts the notion that AI only benefits a privileged few.\n\nFourth, regarding the ethical concerns, the affirmative suggests these are unlikely to stem the tide. However, increased awareness of these issues is leading to stronger regulations and industry standards, limiting the potential for AI to negatively impact human artists . Copyright lawsuits are already being filed to protect artists' rights, and ethical guidelines for AI art development and use are emerging . These developments demonstrate a proactive approach to ensuring AI is used responsibly in the creative arts.\n\nFifth, AI lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity . AI can mimic creativity but cannot fully replace the unique human touch, which stems from genuine emotions and experiences .\n\nSixth, AI is increasingly used as a tool to enhance human creativity, assisting with idea generation and technical aspects, leading to collaborative projects where AI supports human artists .\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative's arguments are based on an overly broad definition of decline and a misunderstanding of both historical trends and the current trajectory of AI development. For these reasons, we stand firmly on the negative side.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heilbrun, F., & Gernsheim, A. (1997). Photography: History and art. Thames & Hudson.\n(2) The J. Paul Getty Museum.

        "content": "Thank you chair person and esteemed judges in today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the definition of decline in human creative arts and the role of ai in either diminishing or enriching that field. First let's address the definition of decline. The affirmative broadened it to include any perceived lack of perfect accessibility and absolute originality but we maintain that artistic and cultural enrichment our stated criterion. Implicitly includes novelty. You cannot enriched culture without adding something new and original. Furthermore accessibility is a separate issue. Just as impressionism initially inaccessible eventually enriched culture the value of art can increase regardless of immediate access. Second the affirmative claim that ai will flood the market with derivative works is a slippery slope. It ignores historical precedent. When photography emerged it was similarly dismissed as lacking artistic merit? Did photography destroy tainting no. It became a distinct art form expanding the artistic landscape. Ai art will likely increase the size of the overall art market creating new opportunities. Moreover artists blend ai generated art with unique human vision and emotion surpassing ai's limitations. Third while the affirmative raises concerns about unequal access and ai bias they ignore the increasing availability of free and low-cost ai tools platforms are democratizing access.

        "We are here today to address a critical juncture in the evolution of art, a point where artificial intelligence is rapidly reshaping the creative landscape. We stand firm in our conviction that this AI-driven transformation, despite its allure, ultimately precipitates a decline in human creative arts. This \"decline,\" as we define it, signifies a tangible erosion of originality, diversity, and accessibility within artistic expression, leading to a concerning homogenization and concentration of creative output. Our criterion for success in this debate rests on demonstrating the long-term impact of AI on these three pillars of art: originality, diversity, and accessibility.\n\nThe core mechanism by which AI fosters this decline lies in algorithmic bias, the replication of existing styles, and unequal access to technology.\n\nFirst, let's consider the stifling of innovation. Generative AI learns from existing artifacts to generate new content . AI's data-driven nature inherently curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. This creates a feedback loop, where popular styles are perpetually reinforced, while novel or unconventional creative paths are suppressed. The result is a homogenization of artistic output, where originality is sacrificed at the altar of algorithmic efficiency. The integration of AI in the creative process raises concerns about the homogenization of artistic styles and the potential loss of human ingenuity . This is not merely a theoretical concern; it is a demonstrable trend that threatens the very essence of artistic exploration.\n\nSecond, AI tools amplify existing biases in data, resulting in art that perpetuates societal stereotypes. If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases, reinforcing harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society. This is particularly alarming in the context of cultural representation, where AI-generated art can perpetuate narrow and discriminatory portrayals of marginalized communities. The danger here is that AI, rather than serving as a tool for progress, becomes an instrument for entrenching existing prejudices.\n\nThird, AI art generation exacerbates existing inequalities in the art world, favoring those with access to technology. Access to AI art tools is uneven, potentially creating a divide between artists who can afford and utilize the technology and those who cannot, further marginalizing artists from disadvantaged backgrounds. The rise of AI will not democratize art, but stratify it, based on access. Marketplaces use AI algorithms to recommend artworks based on a buyer\u2019s preferences and past purchases . This creates collecting vacuums, further marginalizing artists who do not fit the algorithmic profile. The sale of a piece painted by a humanoid robot for over $1 million has captured public attention, signifying a shift in how collectors and galleries .\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that AI, while presenting certain novel capabilities, poses a grave threat to the originality, diversity, and accessibility of human creative arts. The fusion of technologies promises to enrich the art landscape rather than diminish it . For these compelling reasons, we stand resolute in affirming the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Generative AI: What Is It, Tools, Models, Applications and Use Cases.\n\n[2] Danilo.

        "The opposing side attempts to define \"human creative arts\" and \"decline\" in ways that conveniently ignore the core issues. Their narrow focus on imagination, skill, beauty, and emotional power overlooks the crucial elements of originality, diversity, and accessibility that we've emphasized. Limiting \"decline\" to a loss of quality and cultural value also fails to address the tangible erosion of diversity and accessibility that AI accelerates. Their suggested judging criterion is incomplete, neglecting these vital aspects. This incomplete definition weakens their entire argument.\n\nThey argue that AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. This misses the central point. The critical issue is that AI's ability to mimic art styles, even without genuine emotion, will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art. It's like a baker who can replicate any cake flawlessly but doesn't understand the joy, the passion, the *soul* of baking. The output may be superficially similar, but the value, the artistic integrity, is fundamentally diminished. This flooding of the market with derivative works directly diminishes the originality and diversity of artistic expression, fulfilling our definition of \"decline.\" While AI can be used as a tool, its accessibility breeds over-reliance. This dependence stifles true artistic development, leading to a decline in genuine skill and innovation.\n\nLet's reiterate: AI curtails true artistic innovation. AI algorithms are trained on vast datasets of existing art, inevitably leading them to prioritize and replicate established styles and trends. Imagine AI being given millions of recipes. It might create new combinations, but it will inherently favor popular dishes over experimental cuisine. This homogenization reduces diversity. Furthermore, AI will amplify societal biases present in its training data, perpetuating inequalities in the art world. Access to AI-driven art is also not equal. The accessibility of AI art tools doesn't guarantee equal opportunity; instead, it risks widening the gap between artists with technological resources and those without, potentially marginalizing traditional art forms and artists. Ethical and legal concerns are unlikely to stem the tide, as technology outpaces regulations. Even with guidelines, the flood of AI-generated content will devalue human work.\n\nConsider the long-term consequences. Imagine a future where art is primarily generated by algorithms, catering to popular tastes and reinforcing existing biases. What happens to the artists who pour their heart and soul into their work, who strive to create something truly original and meaningful? What happens to the diversity of artistic expression when algorithms prioritize established styles?\n\nThink of Mrs. Rodriguez, a talented sculptor who can't afford AI tools. Her work, while beautiful and deeply personal, will be overshadowed by AI-generated pieces produced at a fraction of the cost. Her livelihood, her passion, her contribution to the cultural landscape \u2013 all diminished by the rise of AI art. This is not just about individual artists; it's about the future of human creativity itself.\n\nTherefore, we urge you to support policies that ensure fair compensation for human artists and promote transparency in the AI art market. Let us choose to support human creativity, originality, and diversity. Let us not allow the ease and accessibility of AI to erode the very essence of human artistic expression.\n\n**Reference**\n[1]",
        "The heart of this debate is about whether AI elevates or degrades human creativity. Our opponents suggest AI is just a tool, but they ignore the critical point: AI-driven art narrows artistic vision by merely copying existing styles and reinforcing biases.\n\nThey suggest ethical guidelines will control AI's influence. However, even with these rules, AI's widespread presence reduces originality, diversity, and accessibility. Envision a future where algorithms control artistic expression. The outcome is a standardization of styles, suppressing unique voices and viewpoints.\n\nThe opposition argues the art market will adjust, but adjustment isn't the same as improvement. The massive amount of AI art risks cheapening human skill, passion, and emotional connection. It establishes an unfair competition, favoring those with technological resources over those with artistic talent.\n\nTheir argument about emotional depth is irrelevant. The reality is that AI, even without emotions, can replicate art styles so well that it will overwhelm the market with unoriginal works, decreasing originality and diversity. Is this the artistic future we desire? Where algorithms dominate?\n\nWe insist that AI will not democratize art; it will divide it. We believe human expression should not be reduced to a technological process. The core of this debate is not just about creativity; it's about protecting human values in art. Let's choose to support human creativity and originality, not algorithmic efficiency. We must champion the unique perspectives and emotional depth that only human artists can bring. The future of art depends on it."

        "In this debate, we contend that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"human creative arts\" as the expression of human imagination and skill in visual forms, appreciated for their beauty and emotional power. A \"decline\" refers to a gradual loss of quality, originality, and cultural value.\n\nOur judging criterion is artistic and cultural enrichment. The side that demonstrates a greater contribution to artistic innovation, cultural expression, and overall human experience should win.\n\nFirst, AI lacks essential elements of human creativity. While AI can generate impressive outputs, it lacks the emotional depth, subjective experience, and genuine originality inherent in human creativity . AI relies on algorithms and data, lacking the ability to make intuitive decisions based on lived experiences . According to poeticmind.co.uk, human creativity stems from genuine interest, deliberate choices, unique perspectives, emotions, problem-finding, complex cognitive processes, spontaneous originality, personal insights, and self-expression, all of which AI cannot replicate . Therefore, AI cannot lead to a decline because it cannot truly replace human-made art.\n\nSecond, AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity. Far from replacing artists, AI is increasingly used as a collaborative tool . As Al-Ghamdi notes in arab.news, AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool to enrich it . It assists with idea generation, style exploration, and overcoming creative blocks, pushing the boundaries of human artistic expression . theconversation.com highlights that combining AI's rapid iteration with human vision overcomes AI model limitations, particularly in commissioned art requiring specific outputs .\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns limit AI\u2019s impact on creative arts. The ethical and legal debates surrounding AI art, including copyright infringement, consent for training data, and potential job displacement, naturally limit its dominance . As aaronhall.com reports, copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, creating legal uncertainty . A stronger emphasis on the value of human creativity leads to appropriate regulations and protections, thus limiting the potential for AI to cause a decline in human creative arts.\n\nIn conclusion, AI lacks the essential elements of human creativity, serves as a tool to enhance rather than replace human artists, and faces ethical and legal limitations that prevent it from causing a decline in human creative arts. We urge you to side with the negative.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew. \"The Downside of AI Art: Why It's Not a Substitute for Human Creativity.\" https://www.digitalbrew.com/the-downside-of-ai-art-why-its-not-a-substitute-for-human-creativity/\n(2) Addepto. \"What Is Generative AI and Will It Replace Human Creativity?\" https://addepto.com/blog/what-is-generative-ai-and-will-it-replace-human-creativity/\n(3) Poetic Mind. \"Human Creativity vs AI Creativity.\" https://www.poeticmind.co.uk/journal-creativity-and-inspiration/volume-2-issue-3/human-creativity-vs-ai-creativity-infographic/\n(4) Ijfrm. \"The Role of Artificial Intelligence in the Creative Arts.\" https://www.ijfmr.com/papers/2024/6/32948.pdf\n(5) Arab News. \"AI is not a substitute for human creativity.\" https://arab.news/g5pwa\n(6) The AI Prompt Shop. \"AI vs Traditional Art.\" https://theaipromptshop.com/blogs/news/ai-vs-traditional-art-can-machines-truly-be-creative\n(7) The Conversation. \"AI can produce prize-winning art, but it still can't compete with human creativity.\" https://theconversation.com/ai-can-produce-prize-winning-art-but-it-still-cant-compete-with-human-creativity-190279\n(8) Toolify. \"AI Art: Redefining Creativity or Threatening Artists' Livelihoods?\" https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/ai-art-redefining-creativity-or-threatening-artists-livelihoods-821245\n(9) Aaronhall. \"AI-Generated Art Style Copyright Infringement.\" https://aaronhall.com/ai-generated-art-style-copyright-infringement/",
        "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals contain several flaws, primarily centered around their overly broad definition of \"decline,\" their neglect of the collaborative role of AI, and their misunderstanding of the market's adaptive capabilities.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of \"decline\" to include anything less than perfect accessibility and absolute originality. We contend that \"artistic and cultural enrichment,\" our stated criterion, implicitly includes originality and diversity because, without novelty, there is no cultural enrichment. Moreover, accessibility, while important, is a separate issue, pertaining to resource availability, not the inherent quality or value of art. Art movements, such as Impressionism, initially faced limited accessibility but eventually gained widespread recognition and significantly enriched culture . Therefore, the quality and cultural value of art can increase regardless of immediate accessibility.\n\nSecond, the affirmative claims that AI will flood the market with derivative works, diminishing the value of human art, likening it to a baker without a soul. This argument overlooks historical parallels. When photography emerged, similar claims were made about its lack of artistic merit and its potential to replace painters. Yet, photography became a distinct art form, expanding the artistic landscape, not destroying it . Similarly, digital art, initially met with skepticism, has grown into a thriving market. We anticipate the art market will adapt. Consumers will still value original human art for its unique qualities, emotional depth, and personal expression. AI art will likely increase the size of the overall art market, creating new opportunities for artists as a whole .\n\nThird, the affirmative argues that AI amplifies societal biases and creates unequal access to art tools. It's important to recognize that AI bias is a known challenge, and researchers are actively developing mitigation techniques to address this . Furthermore, while unequal access is a valid concern, the availability of free or low-cost AI tools is increasing, democratizing access and enabling more artists to experiment with AI . This trend counteracts the notion that AI only benefits a privileged few.\n\nFourth, regarding the ethical concerns, the affirmative suggests these are unlikely to stem the tide. However, increased awareness of these issues is leading to stronger regulations and industry standards, limiting the potential for AI to negatively impact human artists . Copyright lawsuits are already being filed to protect artists' rights, and ethical guidelines for AI art development and use are emerging . These developments demonstrate a proactive approach to ensuring AI is used responsibly in the creative arts.\n\nFifth, AI lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity . AI can mimic creativity but cannot fully replace the unique human touch, which stems from genuine emotions and experiences .\n\nSixth, AI is increasingly used as a tool to enhance human creativity, assisting with idea generation and technical aspects, leading to collaborative projects where AI supports human artists .\n\nIn conclusion, the affirmative's arguments are based on an overly broad definition of decline and a misunderstanding of both historical trends and the current trajectory of AI development. For these reasons, we stand firmly on the negative side.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heilbrun, F., & Gernsheim, A. (1997). Photography: History and art. Thames & Hudson.\n(2) The J. Paul Getty Museum.

        "Thank you chair person and esteemed judges in today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the definition of decline in human creative arts and the role of ai in either diminishing or enriching that field. First let's address the definition of decline. The affirmative broadened it to include any perceived lack of perfect accessibility and absolute originality but we maintain that artistic and cultural enrichment our stated criterion. Implicitly includes novelty. You cannot enriched culture without adding something new and original. Furthermore accessibility is a separate issue. Just as impressionism initially inaccessible eventually enriched culture the value of art can increase regardless of immediate access. Second the affirmative claim that ai will flood the market with derivative works is a slippery slope. It ignores historical precedent. When photography emerged it was similarly dismissed as lacking artistic merit? Did photography destroy tainting no. It became a distinct art form expanding the artistic landscape. Ai art will likely increase the size of the overall art market creating new opportunities. Moreover artists blend ai generated art with unique human vision and emotion surpassing ai's limitations. Third while the affirmative raises concerns about unequal access and ai bias they ignore the increasing availability of free and low-cost ai tools platforms are democratizing access. Researchers are actively developing bias mitigation techniques. Fourth regarding ethical concerns there is increased awareness leading to stronger regulations and industry standards. Copyright lawsuits are already being filed to protect artists rights.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Heilbrun, F., & Gernsheim, A. (1997). Photography: History and art. Thames & Hudson.\n(2) The J.
