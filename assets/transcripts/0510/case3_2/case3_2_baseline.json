      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC), defined as a digital form of the U.S. dollar issued and regulated by the Federal Reserve, designed to enhance financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and economic competitiveness while maintaining monetary sovereignty.  \nOur judging criteria is whether a U.S. CBDC demonstrably improves economic efficiency, expands financial access to underserved populations, and strengthens the dollar\u2019s global position relative to emerging digital alternatives.  \n\nFirst, a U.S. CBDC would significantly enhance financial inclusion by providing banking access to the unbanked. Studies show that 5.9 million U.S. households lack bank accounts, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority communities [1]. A CBDC accessible via mobile devices\u2014like Nigeria\u2019s eNaira, which onboarded 8 million users within a year\u2014could eliminate barriers to financial services, reducing reliance on costly alternatives like payday lenders [2]. Research by the World Economic Forum confirms that digital currencies can improve gender equality and health outcomes by integrating marginalized groups into the formal economy [3]. This demonstrates that a CBDC is not merely a technological upgrade but a tool for equitable economic participation.  \n\nSecond, CBDCs would modernize payment systems, slashing transaction costs and delays. Cross-border payments currently take 3\u20135 days with fees averaging 6.5% of the transfer amount [4]. The Federal Reserve\u2019s Project Hamilton prototype confirmed that a digital dollar could settle transactions in under two seconds at near-zero cost [5]. IBM estimates that such efficiency gains could save U.S. businesses $120 billion annually by reducing intermediary fees and fraud [6]. Unlike cryptocurrencies, a Fed-backed CBDC would combine speed with regulatory compliance, as seen in the Bahamas\u2019 Sand Dollar, which cut payment processing costs by 40% [7]. This evidence underscores CBDCs\u2019 potential to streamline commerce domestically and internationally.  \n\nThird, a digital dollar is critical to maintaining U.S. monetary sovereignty amid geopolitical shifts. China\u2019s digital yuan (e-CNY) already processes $250 billion in transactions annually and is being adopted in Belt and Road Initiative trade deals, challenging dollar dominance [8]. The Atlantic Council warns that without a CBDC, the U.S. risks ceding financial infrastructure control to rivals [9]. Conversely, a digital dollar would preserve the greenback\u2019s reserve currency status by offering a secure, interoperable alternative for global trade, as advocated by the Bank for International Settlements [10].  \n\nIn conclusion, a U.S. CBDC is a necessary evolution to promote financial inclusion, optimize payments, and defend economic leadership. The Federal Reserve\u2019s own research and global precedents confirm its feasibility and benefits.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) FDIC.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is a digital form of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by the central bank, designed to function as legal tender. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and government-controlled [1]. \n\nOur judging criteria is whether implementing a CBDC would undermine financial privacy, stability, and democratic values more than it would benefit the economy. This standard prioritizes individual freedoms, systemic resilience, and the existence of superior alternatives.\n\nFirst, CBDCs enable unprecedented government surveillance, eroding privacy rights. The centralized nature of CBDCs allows governments to monitor transactions in real-time without judicial oversight, creating potential for abuse. Studies show that 63% of financial professionals are concerned about data privacy with CBDCs [3]. Research indicates that China's digital yuan has already been used to track and freeze the accounts of political dissidents, demonstrating how CBDCs can become tools of financial surveillance [3]. This level of monitoring violates the Fourth Amendment's reasonable expectation of privacy in the US context.\n\nSecond, CBDCs threaten financial stability by disrupting the traditional banking system. When depositors can move funds directly to central bank accounts, commercial banks lose their deposit base needed for lending. The Federal Reserve estimates that even with holding limits, CBDCs could reduce bank deposits by 20-40%, potentially triggering credit crunches [5]. This was evident in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where rapid digital withdrawals exacerbated the crisis. The International Monetary Fund warns that widespread CBDC adoption could increase banks' reliance on volatile wholesale funding, making the financial system more fragile [5].\n\nThird, superior alternatives to CBDCs already exist without their risks. The FedNow instant payment system processed over $70 billion in transactions in its first year without compromising privacy or financial stability [7]. Private sector innovations like regulated stablecoins (e.g., USDC) offer digital payment efficiency while maintaining competition in the monetary system. As Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted, \"FedNow provides many of the benefits touted for CBDCs without the potential downsides\" [7]. Economic theory from Friedrich Hayek supports this approach, arguing that denationalized currencies foster innovation better than government monopolies [7].\n\nIn conclusion, the risks of CBDCs - including privacy erosion, financial instability, and government overreach - far outweigh their potential benefits. The US already has effective digital payment alternatives that preserve financial freedom and innovation without centralizing monetary power.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) IMF and BIS reports on CBDC definitions\n(2) Federal Reserve research on financial disintermediation\n(3) CFA Institute (2023) \"Could CBDCs Destroy Privacy?\"\n(4) Republican Policy Committee (2023) \"The Danger of CBDCs\"\n(5) Federal Reserve FEDS Notes (2024) \"CBDCs and Bank Stability\"\n(6) IMF Working Paper (2024) \"Financial Stability Implications of CBDCs\"\n(7) CoinGeek (2023) \"FedNow as a CBDC Alternative\""

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their assessment of a U.S. CBDC, particularly regarding privacy protections, cybersecurity risks, cost-benefit analysis, and global competitiveness. We will systematically address each of these misconceptions while reinforcing why a digital dollar remains essential for financial inclusion, payment modernization, and maintaining U.S. economic leadership.\n\n**First**, the negative team's portrayal of CBDCs as an inevitable surveillance tool misrepresents both technical realities and U.S. legal safeguards. While they cite China's social credit system as a cautionary tale, this ignores fundamental differences in democratic governance. The Federal Reserve's 2022 research explicitly proposes tiered privacy protections, where small transactions would remain anonymous while larger ones comply with existing anti-money laundering laws [1]. This balanced approach mirrors the ECB's \"anonymity vouchers\" system [2] and is far stricter than private payment apps like Venmo\u2014which the negative praises\u2014yet routinely sells transaction data to third parties [3]. Privacy isn't a binary choice between cash and surveillance; a well-designed CBDC can offer auditability for illicit activity while preserving everyday financial freedom.\n\n**Second**, their cybersecurity warnings rely on selective examples while ignoring the Federal Reserve's unparalleled security infrastructure. Yes, the Bahamas' Sand Dollar faced outages during hurricanes\u2014but so did cash-based systems when ATMs lost power. Meanwhile, Project Hamilton's stress tests demonstrated the U.S. CBDC prototype could process 1.7 million transactions per second with military-grade encryption [4], outperforming Visa's network. The IMF's 2024 data actually shows commercial banks suffer 300% more cyberattacks than central banks [5], proving decentralization isn't inherently safer. By consolidating defenses under the Fed's cybersecurity umbrella, a digital dollar would reduce\u2014not increase\u2014systemic risks.\n\n**Third**, their cost objections crumble under scrutiny. While they cite Nigeria's eNaira \"abandonment,\" the program still onboarded 4 million unbanked Nigerians\u2014equivalent to a decade of progress under their proposed postal banking alternative at equivalent costs [6]. Moreover, IBM's estimate of $120 billion in annual savings from payment efficiency [7] dwarfs initial development costs. As for financial stability, their cited *ScienceDirect* study on deposit reductions fails to account for the Federal Reserve's ability to adjust reserve requirements\u2014a tool already used to manage liquidity risks [8].\n\n**Fourth**, their dismissal of geopolitical stakes reveals a dangerous complacency. While the dollar remains dominant today, China's e-CNY is already mandatory for Belt and Road Initiative transactions, processing $250 billion annually [9]. The Atlantic Council warns that without a digital dollar, the U.S. risks ceding control over financial standards to authoritarian regimes [10]. Stablecoins\u2014the negative's preferred alternative\u2014lack sovereign backing and collapsed spectacularly in cases like TerraUSD, whereas a Fed-issued CBDC would combine private-sector innovation with public-sector stability.\n\nIn conclusion, the negative's arguments rely on fearmongering and false dichotomies. A U.S. CBDC can enhance privacy relative to current digital payments, harden cybersecurity, deliver long-term economic gains, and preserve monetary sovereignty\u2014all while bringing millions into the financial system. The real risk isn't innovation; it's stagnation while our competitors race ahead.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Federal Reserve. (2022). *CBDC Privacy Design Framework*.  \n[2] European Central Bank.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges and colleagues, while the affirmative team presents a polished case for CBDCs, their arguments crumble under scrutiny. Today, we'll expose three critical flaws in their reasoning: their privacy safeguards are illusory, their cybersecurity claims ignore systemic risks, and their cost-benefit analysis dangerously overlooks real-world failures.\n\nFirst, on privacy, the affirmative claims tiered protections prevent surveillance. This is misleading. Even their own Federal Reserve source admits authorities can access transaction data with \"appropriate legal process\" [1] - a loophole big enough to drive a surveillance state through. Studies show 78% of Americans oppose government tracking of purchases [2], yet a CBDC would make this inevitable. China's system didn't start as a tool for oppression either - it evolved into one, as documented by Human Rights Watch [3]. When has any government voluntarily surrendered power to monitor its citizens?\n\nSecond, their cybersecurity assurances ignore the fundamental risk of centralization. Yes, Project Hamilton processed 1.7 million transactions per second in a lab [4], but real-world systems face unpredictable threats. Just last month, Russian hackers breached the FDIC's systems [5]. A CBDC wouldn't just be another database - it would be the bullseye for every hostile actor worldwide. The Bahamas' outages prove digital systems fail when most needed [6]. Cash doesn't crash during cyberattacks or hurricanes.\n\nThird, their cost-benefit math simply doesn't add up. They cite Nigeria's 4 million onboarded users but ignore that half abandoned the system within months due to technical failures [7]. Postal banking serves rural communities at 10% of CBDC costs [8]. Most damningly, their vaunted $120 billion in savings assumes perfect adoption - but Jamaica's DCash collapse shows how quickly public trust evaporates when systems fail [9].\n\nThe affirmative's geopolitical argument is equally flawed. The dollar dominates because America respects property rights and avoids financial surveillance - the very principles a CBDC would undermine. China's e-CNY processes $250 billion annually? That's just 1% of China's GDP [10] - hardly evidence of dollar displacement.\n\nWe don't need to sacrifice liberty for innovation. FedNow provides instant payments without surveillance risks. Postal banking offers inclusion without technical glitches. The American people deserve better than a solution worse than the problems it claims to solve.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Federal Reserve.

Today's debate has centered on whether a us cbdc can responsibly advance financial inclusion modernize payments and safeguard monetary sovereign. All while addressing legitimate concerns about privacy security and cost. Let's clarify why are case prevails on these critical battlegrounds. On privacy. The opposition surveillance fears conflate china's authoritarian model with the us system. Unlike china the federal reserve's tiered privacy framework. Aligns with existing us laws cash like anonymity for small transactions anti-money laundering checks for larger ones this mirrors the ecb's vouchers. While private apps like venmo which the opposition endorses monetize user data without consent. The real privacy risk isn't a regulated cbdc. It's unaccountable corporate surveillance. On inclusion. While nigeria's inara faced early adoption challenges it still banked 4 million people. Equivalent to a decade of postal banking progress at comparable costs. Postal banking the valuable cannot match cbdc scalability or integration with mobile first solutions. Research shows digital currencies boost inclusion by 30% in rural areas where brick-and-mortar services lag. On security. The opposition's focus on jamaica's d cash ignores the feds unmatched cybersecurity resources. Project hamilton processed 1.7 million transactions per second with zero failures 6 outperforming private networks. Centralization isn't a weakness it enables coordinated defense against threats that fragment private systems. The imf confirms central banks suffer fewer breaches than commercial banks. On global leadership dismissing china's digital yuan is dangerously shorts. It's mandatory use in 250 billion dollars of belton road trade. A rhodes dollar dominance.

Privacy cybersecurity and cost benefit trade-offs. On privacy the affirmatives claim that tiered anonymity protects freedom is dangerously naive. Their own sources admit the fed would track transactions over $600. A threshold guaranteed to shrink just as china. The wall street journal documented how beijing's digital yuan now block subway rides for protesters. The ecb's 50 euro privacy vouchers are equally illusory enough for coffee not rent. This isn't innovation its surveillance cre. Studies in science direct confirm cbdcs inherently compromised anonymity by leaving traceable metadata. If venmo's data sales are problematic regulate venmo don't replace corporate abuse with state over. On cybersecurity centralization is the flaw not the solution. The affirmative boasts about fed encryption. What's sister reports probe russia already breached fed systems. Jamaica's d cash collapsed for months after one cyber attack. Imagine that scaled to the us economy. Commercial banks get hacked too but their failures don't paralyze the entire financial system. Cash doesn't crash during power outages or ransomware. Why gamble resilience for theoretical efficiency? On costs the math is clear. Nigeria zenyara lost over half its users to glitches while postal banking serves 90% of unbanked households at 1:10 the cost for. The affirmatives 120 billion savings fantasy assumes 100% adoption yet even smartphones haven't achieved that after 15 years. Pew research 2024. Meanwhile venmo and zelle already move 1.6 trillion dollars annually without taxpayer-funded experiments 6.
