      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC), defined as a digital form of the U.S. dollar issued and regulated by the Federal Reserve. A CBDC would serve as a public digital payment option, complementing physical cash and commercial bank money while enhancing financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and economic competitiveness.\n\nOur judging criteria is whether a U.S. CBDC demonstrably improves financial inclusion for unbanked populations, reduces transaction costs and settlement times, and strengthens the dollar's global position against foreign digital currencies and private stablecoins, while maintaining monetary sovereignty and security. \n\nFirst, a U.S. CBDC would significantly enhance financial inclusion by providing secure, low-cost banking access to underserved populations. Currently, 5.4 million U.S. households remain unbanked [1]. Research shows that CBDCs accessible via mobile devices, like the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, successfully reduce barriers to financial services by eliminating account minimums and physical branch requirements [2]. Studies indicate that digital currencies can lower transaction costs by up to 80% compared to traditional remittance services, making financial services affordable for low-income households [3]. This directly addresses systemic financial exclusion, a critical social and economic issue.\n\nSecond, implementing a CBDC would revolutionize payment efficiency by enabling near-instant, low-cost transactions. Traditional cross-border payments through intermediaries like SWIFT take 2-5 days and incur fees averaging 6.5% of the transfer amount [4]. In contrast, China's digital yuan (e-CNY) processes 300,000 transactions per second with settlement times under one second [5]. Federal Reserve research confirms that CBDCs could reduce U.S. payment system costs by $100 billion annually by eliminating intermediaries [6]. Such efficiency gains would benefit businesses through faster cash flows and consumers through reduced remittance fees.\n\nThird, a digital dollar is essential to maintain U.S. monetary leadership amid global CBDC competition. Over 130 countries are developing CBDCs, with China's e-CNY already being used in $12.8 billion of Belt and Road Initiative transactions [7]. The IMF warns that without a digital dollar, the U.S. could lose up to 30% of its dollar-based trade settlement dominance to alternative systems by 2030 [8]. A well-designed U.S. CBDC would preserve dollar hegemony while countering private stablecoins that threaten monetary policy effectiveness [9].\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports implementing a U.S. CBDC to advance financial inclusion, modernize payment systems, and secure economic leadership. As 98% of central banks now research CBDCs [10], the United States must act decisively to shape this financial revolution rather than react to it.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) FDIC 2021 National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households\n(2) Central Bank of The Bahamas: Sand Dollar Whitepaper 2022  \n(3) UNDP Singapore Policy Centre: \"Achieving Financial Inclusion Through Digital Currencies\" (2023)  \n(4) World Bank Remittance Price Database 2023  \n(5) People's Bank of China e-CNY Progress Report 2023  \n(6) Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond Economic Brief (2022)  \n(7) IMF Working Paper: \"Geopolitics of Digital Currencies\" (2024)  \n(8) Atlantic Council CBDC Tracker 2024  \n(9) Federal Reserve Speech by Governor Brainard (2022)  \n(10) BIS 2023 CBDC Survey of Central Banks"

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that **the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC)**. A CBDC is a digital form of fiat currency issued by the central bank, which poses significant risks to financial privacy, banking stability, and economic freedom without offering clear advantages over existing alternatives.  \n\nOur judging criteria is **whether CBDCs undermine financial privacy, destabilize the banking system, or fail to demonstrate superiority over current digital payment solutions**.  \n\n### First, CBDCs threaten financial privacy and enable government surveillance.  \nStudies show that 63% of CFA charterholders cite data privacy as a top concern with CBDCs, as governments could monitor transactions without judicial oversight [1]. Research indicates that centralized ledgers allow unprecedented tracking of financial behavior, chilling free economic activity and enabling abuse of power [2]. For example, China\u2019s digital yuan has already been used to monitor dissidents, demonstrating how CBDCs can become tools of state control [3]. This erosion of anonymity contradicts foundational principles of economic liberty in the U.S.  \n\n### Second, CBDCs risk bank disintermediation and financial instability.  \nThe Bank for International Settlements warns that if consumers shift deposits to CBDCs, banks could lose a critical funding source for loans, raising borrowing costs and triggering crises [4]. IMF studies highlight that even partial deposit flight in CBDC pilot countries has increased reliance on costly wholesale funding, reducing credit availability [5]. Historical precedents, such as bank runs during the Great Depression, illustrate how sudden withdrawals can destabilize the financial system\u2014a risk amplified by CBDCs [6].  \n\n### Third, superior alternatives like FedNow and stablecoins already exist.  \nThe Federal Reserve\u2019s FedNow system provides real-time payments without the surveillance risks of a CBDC [7]. Private stablecoins like USDC process over $50 billion in daily transactions, proving the efficiency of decentralized digital payments [8]. Comparative analysis shows these alternatives preserve innovation and privacy while avoiding the systemic risks posed by centralized digital currencies [9].  \n\n### In conclusion, CBDCs introduce unnecessary dangers to privacy, banking stability, and economic freedom while failing to outperform existing solutions. The U.S. should reject their implementation.  \n\n#\n\n**Reference**\n(1) CFA Institute. (2023). *Could CBDCs Destroy Privacy?*  \n(2) Republican Policy Committee.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their assessment of central bank digital currencies. We will address these misconceptions point by point, demonstrating why a U.S. CBDC would be both beneficial and necessary for our financial future.\n\nFirst, regarding privacy concerns, the opposition claims CBDCs inherently enable government surveillance. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of design possibilities. The European Central Bank's digital euro pilot has already demonstrated that robust encryption can protect user identities while maintaining transaction security [IMF 2022]. Moreover, current payment systems like credit cards and FedNow already track transactions - the difference is that a CBDC would be subject to constitutional privacy protections that private systems aren't. We can design a system that balances transparency for law enforcement with personal privacy, something the opposition fails to acknowledge.\n\nSecond, the argument about bank disintermediation relies on worst-case scenarios that don't reflect actual policy proposals. Research from the IMF shows that CBDCs can be implemented with holding limits and tiered interest rates to prevent mass deposit flight from traditional banks [IMF Working Paper 2024]. In fact, the Federal Reserve's Project Hamilton is specifically exploring these safeguards [Federal Reserve 2023]. The opposition's alarmist predictions ignore these practical solutions already in development.\n\nThird, their claim about superior alternatives doesn't hold up to scrutiny. While FedNow offers real-time payments, it still requires bank accounts, leaving out millions of unbanked Americans. Private stablecoins like USDC may process large volumes, but they lack federal insurance and have shown vulnerability to collapses, as seen with TerraUSD [CoinGecko 2022]. Only a CBDC combines universal access with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.\n\nFourth, the opposition completely ignores the financial inclusion benefits demonstrated by existing CBDCs. The Bahamas' Sand Dollar has successfully brought digital payments to remote island communities [IMF 2023], while Nigeria's eNaira is helping formalize their large informal economy. These real-world examples prove that properly designed CBDCs can expand access far more effectively than any existing alternative.\n\nFinally, the environmental benefits are too significant to dismiss. The production and transportation of physical cash consumes enormous resources - 12,000 tons of cotton and 3,000 tons of ink annually just for U.S. currency [Digital Planet 2023]. A digital dollar would eliminate most of this waste while maintaining all the utility of cash. This is a benefit the opposition conveniently fails to address.\n\nIn conclusion, the risks identified by our opponents are either manageable through proper design or already present in our current system. Meanwhile, the benefits of a U.S. CBDC - financial inclusion, payment efficiency, economic stability, and environmental sustainability - are too substantial to ignore. Other nations are already moving forward with this technology; the United States cannot afford to be left behind.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) IMF, Digital Currencies and Energy Consumption, 2022\n(2) IMF Working Paper, Bank Disintermediation and Funding Costs, 2024\n(3) Federal Reserve, Project Hamilton Progress Report, 2023\n(4) CoinGecko, Stablecoin Market Report, 2022\n(5) IMF, Central Bank Digital Currency Development Enters the Next Phase, 2023\n(6) Digital Planet, How Green is the Greenback?

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of CBDCs, particularly regarding privacy risks, bank stability, alternatives, environmental claims, and the so-called \"global race.\" Let me address these systematically.\n\nFirst, on privacy. The affirmative claims encryption technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can protect CBDC users, but this ignores the fundamental architecture of centralized ledgers. Even with encryption, the Federal Reserve\u2014a government entity\u2014would maintain access to transaction metadata. Research from the IMF eLibrary confirms China's digital yuan has already been weaponized to freeze dissidents' accounts and track purchases without due process [3]. When the government controls the ledger, no technical safeguard can prevent abuse of power\u2014this is why 63% of financial experts cite privacy as their top CBDC concern [1]. The opponent's \"private diary\" analogy fails: a CBDC is more like a diary where the government holds the master key.\n\nSecond, their bank stability argument collapses under scrutiny. While the Bank of England's \u00a310,000 holding limit sounds reassuring, the Bank for International Settlements warns that even small-scale deposit flight to CBDCs could force banks to replace low-cost deposits with expensive wholesale funding, raising lending rates by 1.5-2% according to IMF models [4][5]. This isn't theoretical\u2014when Sweden tested its e-krona, banks saw a 7% drop in retail deposits within months, triggering credit crunches for small businesses [10]. The affirmative's SVB example backfires: had depositors instantly shifted funds to a CBDC during the panic, the bank's collapse would have been even faster. CBDCs don't prevent runs\u2014they digitize them.\n\nThird, their dismissal of alternatives is misleading. FedNow isn't \"just a wire service\"\u2014it settled $70 billion in real-time payments last quarter with zero surveillance risks [7]. Stablecoins like USDC process $50 billion daily because they're decentralized; when SVB froze funds, Circle (USDC's issuer) restored full parity within days\u2014far quicker than FDIC insurance payouts [8]. Meanwhile, the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, which the affirmative praises, has a 98% inactivity rate because citizens prefer cash\u2014proof that CBDCs often solve nonexistent problems [10].\n\nOn environmental claims, the affirmative commits a false equivalence. While physical cash has costs, digital payments already account for 80% of U.S. transactions\u2014FedNow and Visa Net are just as \"green\" as CBDCs without centralization risks [6]. Their 3,000-ton ink statistic is irrelevant when checks represent under 3% of payments\u2014this is like banning horses to reduce traffic deaths in 2024.\n\nFinally, the \"global race\" rhetoric is a red herring. Of 130 countries exploring CBDCs, Finland and Ecuador abandoned theirs due to technical failures, while Japan and Denmark rejected them over privacy concerns [10]. China's digital yuan succeeds only because its citizens lack alternatives\u2014hardly a model for America. Rushing to mimic authoritarian systems betrays our values; as the Cato Institute notes, \"The U.S. dollar dominates not because it's digital, but because it's free\" [9].\n\nIn sum: CBDCs trade liberty for marginal efficiency gains, destabilize banks despite holding limits, and are outpaced by existing solutions. The real \"relic of the past\" is the idea that centralization equals progress. We urge rejection.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] CFA Institute. (2023). *Could CBDCs Destroy Privacy?*  \n[3] IMF eLibrary.

Which leaked data to private corporations? The real privacy risk isn't cbdcs it's the status quo where unregulated intermediaries track your spending. Our solution legally binding encryption standards and offline access ensuring no government overreach on stability the opposition fears deposit flight. Yet their own example of sweden's corona backfire. It's 7% deposit shift occurred without holding limits a safeguard we explicitly indoors.

A cbdc bridges these gaps by working via sms no bank account or smartphone required. This isn't just about speed. It's about inclusivity.

Today\u2019s debate hinges on whether a central bank digital currency (CBDC) aligns with America\u2019s core values of privacy, stability, and economic freedom. Let\u2019s examine why the risks far outweigh the purported benefits.\n\n**Privacy and Government Surveillance**  \nThe affirmative insists CBDCs can protect privacy with encryption, but this ignores the unavoidable reality of centralized control.
