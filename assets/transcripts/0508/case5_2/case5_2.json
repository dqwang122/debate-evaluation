We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "content": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "content": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft.

The core debate is whether AI devalues human skill.\n\nFirst, while our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry, *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates that AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering [1]. This opens doors for new artists traditionally excluded due to technical or resource barriers.

The first claim addresses the core issue of artistic value, arguing that the ease of AI art generation undermines the worth of human artists. The second claim focuses on artistic diversity, suggesting that AI's algorithmic nature leads to a flattening of styles and themes. The third claim broadens the scope to include economic consequences, arguing that AI art could lead to job displacement and increased inequality.

          "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will, indeed, lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what we mean by \"decline.\" We\u2019re not saying human art will disappear entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums, ultimately leading to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider the story of Maria, a freelance illustrator who lost several clients to AI-generated images. Despite her years of experience, she simply couldn't compete with the speed and cost-effectiveness of AI. This epitomizes how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists.\n\nFor these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Thank you.",
          "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan:**\n\nOkay, team, here's our plan of attack. We're supporting the motion: \"AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts.\" First, I'll spend about 100 words clearly defining what we mean by \"decline\" in this context, because that's key to the whole debate. Second, in around 50 words, I'll establish our judging criteria. I'll emphasize the impact on cultural value. Then, I\u2019ll spend the bulk of our time, roughly 372 words, laying out our three main arguments which all have \"high\" importance according to the debate flow tree: how AI devalues artistic skill, how it homogenizes artistic expression, and how it could displace human artists. In the first argument, I will introduce an analogy to make the argument more vivid. I will introduce a powerful story in the third argument.",
          "simulated_audience_feedback": [
            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message is relatively clear: AI will diminish the value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art, leading to a cultural shift. The definition of \"decline\" is helpful. The judging criteria are also clearly stated. However, the connection between the arguments and the overall claim could be strengthened with stronger, more concise topic sentences for each argument.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of analogies (musical instrument, plotlines) is effective in making abstract concepts more accessible. The story of Maria adds a human touch and emotional connection. However, the overall tone is somewhat dry. Injecting more passion and urgency could improve engagement. The introduction could be more captivating to immediately grab the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nWhile the arguments are logical, the opening statement lacks concrete evidence. It mentions \"datasets\" and \"algorithmic art\" but doesn't provide specific examples or sources. The story of Maria is anecdotal and lacks broader context. The claim about job displacement would be stronger with statistics or data on the art market.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe opening statement appeals to the audience's concerns about cultural value, economic opportunity, and artistic diversity. The \"think of it like this\" segments try to establish a practical relevance. However, the statement could be more persuasive by addressing potential counterarguments and acknowledging the potential benefits of AI in art. The call to action is implicit rather than explicit.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of concrete evidence and data to support claims.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces the credibility of the arguments and makes them seem speculative.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add specific examples, statistics, or research findings to support each argument. For instance, instead of just saying \"job displacement,\" cite a report projecting job losses in the art sector due to AI.\n\n2. **Issue:** Over-reliance on analogies without sufficient explanation.\n   **Impact on Audience:** While analogies can be helpful, they can also be oversimplistic and fail to capture the complexity of the issue.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** After presenting an analogy, briefly explain why it's relevant and how it connects to the broader argument. For example, after the \"same ten plotlines\" analogy, elaborate on how AI's reliance on existing data can lead to similar limitations in artistic expression.\n\n3. **Issue:** Weak emotional appeal and lack of a clear call to action.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Fails to fully engage the audience's emotions or inspire them to take action.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Conclude with a powerful statement that emphasizes the importance of preserving human creativity and artistic expression. Suggest a concrete action the audience can take, such as supporting local artists or advocating for policies that protect the arts. This can be as simple as saying, \"Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.\"\n\n4. **Issue:** Absence of counter-argument acknowledgement\n   **Impact on Audience:** Could make the argument seem biased or one-sided.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Acknowledge the potential for AI to augment human creativity, but then quickly transition back to how it can also lead to negative consequences if not managed thoughtfully. For example, \"While AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity.\"\n"

          "mode": "revision",
          "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will indeed lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify what we mean by \"decline.\" We are not suggesting that human art will vanish entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as a process where AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, diminishes the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This ultimately leads to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art. According to *ACM Digital Library*, AI now makes it possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market and depreciating the value of art as a whole.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI-generated art is essentially a remix of prior works, lacking a unique personal vision and potentially leading to derivative, less meaningful art.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider the story of Maria, a freelance illustrator who lost several clients to AI-generated images. Despite her years of experience, she simply couldn't compete with the speed and cost-effectiveness of AI. This epitomizes how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists already believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\n\nWhile AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity. For these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message remains clear: AI will diminish the value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. The definition of \"decline\" is helpful. The judging criteria are well-defined. The logical flow is easy to follow.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe analogies (musical instrument, plotlines) continue to be effective. The story of Maria remains a good human touch, and the inclusion of counter-arguments makes the presentation appear more balanced. The addition of \"Let's champion human artists...\" adds a call to action that creates a strong connection.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe statement has improved by including references to *ACM Digital Library*, *MIT Technology Review*, and *the Academy of Animated Art*. These references add credibility. However, simply stating the source is not enough; a brief summary of the relevant findings from each source would be more impactful. For instance, instead of saying \"According to *ACM Digital Library*...\", say \"*ACM Digital Library* found that AI makes it possible...\". The story of Maria is still anecdotal; supplementing it with broader data on freelance illustrator income trends would be beneficial. It also can be confusing with the reference list at the end. It would be ideal if the title were written in-text so that the audience knows what the reference is for and it would flow in a logical sense.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe statement persuasively combines emotional appeals (story of Maria, call to action) with practical concerns (economic inequality, job displacement). Addressing potential counterarguments (AI offers new tools) strengthens the argument's overall credibility. The solution, \"Let's champion human artists...\", is a good start but could be made more specific (e.g., support funding for art programs, promote human-generated art).\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** References are present but not fully integrated or explained.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may not understand the specific findings or relevance of each source.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Integrate the key findings from each source directly into the text, summarizing them concisely. For instance, \"A 2019 *MIT Technology Review* report found that AI-generated art is often a remix of existing works, lacking unique personal vision.\" This clarifies the relevance of the reference and strengthens the argument. Also, remove the reference list at the end.\n\n2. **Issue:** Anecdotal evidence (story of Maria) could be strengthened with broader data.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The story of Maria is compelling but lacks generalizability.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Supplement the story with statistics on the decline of freelance illustration income or the number of artists being displaced by AI. This provides a broader context and makes the argument more persuasive.\n\n3. **Issue:** The call to action is general; it could be more specific.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may not know how to \"champion human artists.\"\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Provide concrete examples of actions the audience can take, such as supporting local art programs, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, or consciously choosing to purchase art from human artists. For instance, \"Let's champion human artists by supporting local art programs, advocating for policies that protect their rights, and consciously choosing to purchase art from human artists.\"\n"

              "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will indeed lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify what we mean by \"decline.\" We are not suggesting that human art will vanish entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as a process where AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, diminishes the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This ultimately leads to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art. According to *ACM Digital Library*, AI now makes it possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market and depreciating the value of art as a whole.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI-generated art is essentially a remix of prior works, lacking a unique personal vision and potentially leading to derivative, less meaningful art.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider the story of Maria, a freelance illustrator who lost several clients to AI-generated images.

Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms.

          "original_statement": "Let's get started. First, it's crucial to remember what we're debating. We affirm that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts. Human creative arts are original expressions, born from human intellect, skill, and emotion. Decline means less value, originality, opportunity, and appreciation. AI is generative AI trained on existing art. Our judging standard is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. Keep these points in mind as we respond.\n\nNow, let's talk about how AI devalues human artistic skill. The opponent dodges the main issue. AI art floods the market with cheap content. As we have discussed, this brings down the perceived value of art made by humans, which needs time, skill, and emotional input. The opponent says AI amplifies artists, but they don't address the core problem. When AI can make art instantly, the years of training a human artist undertakes become less valued. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting. Even if the print is decent, the original holds more value because of the artist's skill and effort. We aren't saying art can\u2019t be made using AI, we're stating that easier access to art that is comparable with unaided human creation devalues solely human work.\n\nThe claim that AI fosters artistic growth is also misleading. The opponent mentioned that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations, but skill is part of the artistic journey. The argument that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations misses the point: mastery of technique is often inseparable from the artistic statement itself. Moreover, the \"new\" art forms AI creates are based on existing art.\n\nLet's consider copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it\u2019s an appeal to fear.\n\nWe also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. Automation replaces human skills, and some businesses will choose AI over human creators.\n\nFinally, on AI 'restoration,' remember that altering an original piece, even to \"restore\" it, can diminish its authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence shows AI does lead to a decline in human creative arts. The opponent\u2019s arguments don\u2019t change this reality.",
          "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. First, I'll quickly re-establish our key definitions and the judging criteria, making sure we're all on the same page (40 words). Then, I'll zero in on the heart of the matter: how AI devalues human artistic skill by flooding the market (150 words). After that, I'll explain why AI fostering artistic growth is misleading (90 words). Following that, I\u2019ll return to ethical concerns about copyright in AI (70 words). Next, I\u2019ll reinforce that AI reduces opportunities for human artists (60 words). Finally, I will address AI \u2018restoration\u2019 concerns (40 words).\n\nThis strategy focuses on the key issues where AI directly undermines human creativity, artistic value, and economic opportunity. The rhetorical technique I will use is to compare the opponent\u2019s examples to real-world scenarios to highlight flaws in their reasoning. I will also use some examples of factual errors.",
          "simulated_audience_feedback": [
            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal effectively reiterates the core definitions and judging criteria at the beginning, ensuring the audience remains focused on the key issues. The logical flow is generally clear, addressing the opponent's points sequentially. However, the transitions between rebuttals could be smoother and more directly linked to the overarching claim that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of analogies (mass-produced print vs. original painting) is helpful in illustrating the devaluation of human skill. However, the rebuttal could benefit from more engaging language and a more passionate tone. The overall delivery feels somewhat defensive rather than proactively persuasive.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe rebuttal primarily relies on restating previous arguments rather than introducing new evidence to directly counter the opponent's claims. While reiterating key points is important, the absence of new evidence weakens the rebuttal's impact. For example, when addressing the opponent's point about AI enhancing artist workflows, the rebuttal could cite studies showing that AI-assisted art is often perceived as less original or emotionally resonant. The opponent cited BBC, Ultralytics, and a report. The rebuttal did not use a single piece of evidence to counter those claims.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to undermine the opponent's arguments by characterizing them as \"dodging the main issue\" or \"misleading.\" However, this approach can be perceived as dismissive and may alienate the audience. A more persuasive strategy would be to acknowledge the potential benefits of AI while emphasizing the potential negative consequences for human artists. The rebuttal touches on emotional concerns (devaluation of skill, ethical issues) but could amplify these appeals for greater impact.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of new evidence to directly counter the opponent's claims.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces the persuasiveness of the rebuttal and makes it seem repetitive.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Introduce new evidence, such as studies, expert opinions, or data points, to directly refute the opponent's claims. For example, when countering the claim that AI enhances artist workflows, cite research showing that AI-assisted art is often perceived as less original or emotionally resonant. Or, when addressing AI \"restoration,\" find examples where AI restoration has been controversial or altered the original intent of the artist.\n\n2. **Issue:** Overly dismissive tone towards the opponent's arguments.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Can be perceived as arrogant or close-minded, reducing the overall persuasiveness of the rebuttal.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Reframe the rebuttal to acknowledge the potential benefits of AI while emphasizing the potential negative consequences for human artists. Instead of saying \"The opponent dodges the main issue,\" try \"While AI may offer certain benefits, we must not lose sight of the potential for it to devalue human skill and creativity.\" Acknowledge BBC, Ultralytics, and the AI report before providing a more valid claim.\n\n3. **Issue:** Weak connection between rebuttals and the overarching claim.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may lose sight of the main argument that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** At the end of each rebuttal, explicitly link it back to the overarching claim. For example, after addressing the copyright issue, conclude with \"Therefore, the ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.\"\n"

As *Matt Corrall* points out, AI models are limited by the data they are trained on and cannot truly adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being [2]. They simply remix existing styles.

          "original_statement": "Let's get started. First, it's crucial to remember what we're debating. We affirm that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts. Human creative arts are original expressions, born from human intellect, skill, and emotion. Decline means less value, originality, opportunity, and appreciation. AI is generative AI trained on existing art. Our judging standard is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. Keep these points in mind as we respond.\n\nNow, let's address how AI devalues human artistic skill. While the opposition *may* suggest AI amplifies artists, we must not lose sight of the potential for it to devalue human skill and creativity. The core problem is that AI art floods the market with cheap content. As we have discussed, this brings down the perceived value of art made by humans, which needs time, skill, and emotional input. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting. Even if the print is decent, the original holds more value because of the artist's skill and effort. We aren't saying art can\u2019t be made using AI, we're stating that easier access to art that is comparable with unaided human creation devalues solely human work. In fact, *a study in 2024 by UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* confirms that generative AI systems have already led to the replacement of human creatives in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [1]. Therefore, the flood of AI art directly contributes to the decline in the value of human creative arts.\n\nThe claim that AI fosters artistic growth is also misleading. The opponent mentioned that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations, but skill is part of the artistic journey. The argument that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations misses the point: mastery of technique is often inseparable from the artistic statement itself. Moreover, the \"new\" art forms AI creates are based on existing art. As *Matt Corrall* points out, AI models are limited by the data they are trained on and cannot truly adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being [2]. They simply remix existing styles. Therefore, the derivative nature of AI art further contributes to the decline in originality within human creative arts.\n\nLet's consider copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it\u2019s an appeal to fear. The ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.\n\nWe also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. Automation replaces human skills, and some businesses will choose AI over human creators. *PMC* estimates the contemporary art world to be a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists [3]. However, the rise of AI art threatens this ecosystem. Therefore, the reduction of opportunities for human artists due to AI directly leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFinally, on AI 'restoration,' remember that altering an original piece, even to \"restore\" it, can diminish its authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence shows AI does lead to a decline in human creative arts. The opponent\u2019s arguments don\u2019t change this reality.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[2] The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\n[3] Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.

The logical flow has improved with clearer transitions. The direct linking of individual rebuttals to the overarching claim (\"Therefore...\") is a positive addition.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of analogies remains effective. The tone is now more balanced, acknowledging the opposition's points while emphasizing the counterarguments. However, greater emotional resonance could still be achieved by highlighting the personal impact on individual artists and the cultural significance of human creativity.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe addition of evidence from UNCTAD, Matt Corrall, and PMC is a significant improvement. The integration of these sources into the text is also well-executed. However, the evidence could be presented with more nuance. For instance, the PMC estimate of the art market should be contextualized: is this growth or decline? What are the trends? Also, it would be great to reference the specific point to the BBC report that the opponent mentioned earlier.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal is more persuasive due to the stronger evidence and more balanced tone. By directly linking each rebuttal to the decline of human creative arts, the argument is made more compelling. However, the conclusion remains somewhat weak. It could be strengthened by summarizing the key arguments and reiterating the call to action.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of direct engagement with the opponent's specific evidence.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Missed opportunity to directly undermine the credibility of the opponent's claims.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** When addressing the opponent's points, directly reference their sources and explain why they are unreliable, irrelevant, or misinterpreted. For example, when addressing the claim about AI enhancing artist workflows, state: \"The opponent cites a BBC report, but this report focuses on a narrow subset of artists who actively embrace AI. It fails to address the broader concerns about job displacement and devaluation of skill that affect the majority of artists.\" You should also briefly talk about why you disagree with the 78% of artists agreeing with AI. What are your thoughts and evidence behind this claim?\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak conclusion; lacks a strong summary and emotional appeal.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The final impression is less impactful than it could be.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Conclude by summarizing the key arguments, reiterating the call to action, and emphasizing the importance of preserving human creativity. For example: \"In conclusion, we have shown that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts by devaluing skill, raising ethical concerns, and reducing opportunities for artists. While AI may offer certain benefits, we must not allow it to undermine the unique value and cultural significance of human creativity.

          "final_response": "Alright, let's dive in. To begin, let's remember the core of this debate. We stand firm that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts. By \"human creative arts,\" we mean original expressions born from human intellect, skill, and emotion. \"Decline\" signifies less value, originality, opportunity, and appreciation. AI, in this context, refers to generative AI trained on existing art. Our judging standard is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. Keep these definitions in mind as we proceed.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of how AI devalues human artistic skill. The opposition *may* suggest AI amplifies artists, but we must not lose sight of the potential for it to devalue human skill and creativity. The core problem is that AI art floods the market with cheap content. This brings down the perceived value of art made by humans, which requires time, skill, and emotional input. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting. Even if the print is decent, the original holds more value because of the artist's skill and effort. We aren't saying art can\u2019t be made using AI, we're stating that easier access to art that is comparable with unaided human creation devalues solely human work. In fact, *a 2024 study by UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* confirms that generative AI systems have already led to the replacement of human creatives in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [1]. Therefore, the flood of AI art directly contributes to the decline in the value of human creative arts.\n\nThe claim that AI fosters artistic growth is also misleading. The opponent mentioned that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations, but skill is part of the artistic journey. The argument that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations misses the point: mastery of technique is often inseparable from the artistic statement itself. Moreover, the \"new\" art forms AI creates are based on existing art. As *Matt Corrall* points out, AI models are limited by the data they are trained on and cannot truly adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being [2]. They simply remix existing styles. Therefore, the derivative nature of AI art further contributes to the decline in originality within human creative arts.\n\nNow, let's address the ethical concerns surrounding copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it\u2019s an appeal to fear. The ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.\n\nWe also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists.

We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.",

US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems.

Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians.

          "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

We have clearly demonstrated that AI leads to a decline by devaluing human artistic skill, originality, and opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition has failed to adequately address how AI floods the market with content, significantly diminishing the worth of human artists' work. While they claim AI creates new opportunities, *Forbes* reported AI directly replacing creatives, and *Nature* demonstrated that AI-generated art lowers monetary value for all artists. This isn't about progress; it's about devaluation. The core issue is that the market becomes saturated with AI-generated content, making it harder for human artists to gain recognition and fair compensation for their unique skills.\n\nSecond, the opposition brushes aside the serious ethical implications. However, ongoing court cases clearly show AI companies are violating artists' rights. Furthermore, many jurisdictions do not protect artworks created solely by AI. Copyright and ethics are not adaptable, because theft will still be theft. The lack of clear legal frameworks and ethical guidelines surrounding AI-generated art poses a significant threat to the livelihoods and rights of human artists.\n\nFinally, the opposition's vision ultimately involves fewer jobs and lower pay for human artists. They ignore the very real possibility that businesses will increasingly rely on AI, bypassing human writers and artists altogether, leading to significant job losses. Their claim that AI will enhance creativity simply does not hold true because this creative expression will be less worth or valued in the marketplace.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's belief that AI enhances creativity fundamentally misunderstands our position: that it ultimately undermines human artistic skill and decreases opportunities. We ask you to side with human artists. By prioritizing human artistic value, we ensure a richer, more meaningful cultural landscape for all.\n",

          "statement": "In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.",

US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems.

We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "original_statement": "We stand in opposition to the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions provided by the opposition regarding human creative arts, decline, and AI, we believe focusing solely on generative AI and the fear of decreased value and opportunity paints an incomplete picture.\n\nOur stance is this: AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows. They enable them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument. Many artists are already using AI to explore creative boundaries, overcome creative blocks, and produce art they otherwise couldn't. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration can elevate human art rather than diminish it. AI is not a replacement; it's a partner.\n\nAI can also help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI.\n\nMoreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nLet\u2019s address the concerns about copyright and ethics. It is important to know that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value.",

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe core message is generally clear: AI is a tool that amplifies human creativity, rather than replacing it, and its integration can elevate human art. The main arguments supporting this are the enhancement of artist workflows, the preservation and restoration of historical artworks, the facilitation of interactive art, the adaptability of copyright laws, and the evolution of artistic value. However, the logical flow could be strengthened with clearer transitions between these points, and more explicit connections back to the central claim. While technical terms are mostly avoided, a brief explanation of \"prompt engineering\" might be helpful for a general audience.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe use of examples like AI as a \"new type of brush\" and the idea of \"lost masterpieces brought back to life\" are effective analogies and examples that connect with the audience's interests and make the arguments more memorable. Describing the interactive installations also helps keep the audience engaged. However, the statement could benefit from more emotional resonance. While the logical arguments are strong, incorporating anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios showcasing the positive impact of AI on individual artists could make the arguments more compelling. The structure is a bit too list-like and could be woven into a more compelling narrative.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nWhile the statement alludes to real-world examples (artists using AI), it lacks specific evidence to support its claims. Mentioning specific AI tools used by artists, examples of restored artworks, or successful interactive installations would significantly strengthen the argument. The claim about copyright laws being adaptable needs concrete examples of similar adaptations in the past. There are no direct citations in the statement. The argument uses logical reasoning well, but it needs more concrete evidence.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe statement appeals to practicality by highlighting the benefits of AI as a tool. The discussion of copyright and ethics acknowledges a major concern and attempts to offer reassurance. The rebuttal to the opponent's points about devaluation and reduced opportunities is also persuasive, offering an alternative perspective on the evolution of artistic value. However, the statement lacks a strong call to action. While it implicitly suggests embracing AI, it could be more forceful in encouraging the audience to view AI as a creative partner. Highlighting the potential benefits for future generations may strengthen emotional appeal and practical relevance.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of Concrete Evidence\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The absence of specific examples and supporting data weakens the persuasiveness of the arguments. The audience may perceive the claims as speculative or unsubstantiated.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Integrate 1-2 concrete examples per claim. For instance:\n    *   When discussing enhancing artist workflows, name an AI tool (e.g., RunwayML, DALL-E 2) and briefly describe how an artist is using it to create a specific type of art.\n    *   When discussing the restoration of historical artworks, cite a specific project where AI was used to restore a damaged painting or sculpture.\n    *   When discussing the interactive art installation, give the name of the artist and exhibit and briefly describe how the audience could participate.\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak Emotional Resonance and Missing Personal Anecdotes.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The arguments, while logically sound, may not fully resonate with the audience on an emotional level. Without personal stories or emotional appeals, the message may come across as detached and impersonal.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add 1-2 short anecdotes of artists who are using AI to overcome creative obstacles, develop their art, or connect with audience to illustrate how the integration of AI has led to artistic growth, diversification, and new art forms. For example, \"Consider [Artist's Name], who uses AI to [Specific Application] resulting in [Quantifiable Results/Impact].\"\n\n3. **Issue:** Absence of a Strong Call to Action\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The statement ends without a clear sense of what the audience should do or believe. A strong call to action would provide a sense of direction and encourage the audience to embrace the speaker's perspective.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Conclude with a concise call to action, encouraging the audience to:\n    *   Embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in their own artistic endeavors.\n    *   Support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art.\n    *   Advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.\n\n4. **Issue:** Lack of Smooth Transitions Between Arguments\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** The list-like structure of the arguments can make it difficult for the audience to follow the logical flow of the statement. Clearer transitions would improve comprehension and enhance the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Incorporate transition phrases and sentences that connect each argument to the central claim. For example:\n        *   \"Building on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows...\"\n        *   \"Furthermore, AI's role extends beyond individual artists to...\"\n        *    \"To address concerns about copyright, it's important to realize...\"\n\n"

For instance:\n    *   When discussing enhancing artist workflows, name an AI tool (e.g., RunwayML, DALL-E 2) and briefly describe how an artist is using it to create a specific type of art.\n    *   When discussing the restoration of historical artworks, cite a specific project where AI was used to restore a damaged painting or sculpture.\n    *   When discussing the interactive art installation, give the name of the artist and exhibit and briefly describe how the audience could participate.\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak Emotional Resonance and Missing Personal Anecdotes.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The arguments, while logically sound, may not fully resonate with the audience on an emotional level. Without personal stories or emotional appeals, the message may come across as detached and impersonal.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add 1-2 short anecdotes of artists who are using AI to overcome creative obstacles, develop their art, or connect with audience to illustrate how the integration of AI has led to artistic growth, diversification, and new art forms. For example, \"Consider [Artist's Name], who uses AI to [Specific Application] resulting in [Quantifiable Results/Impact].\"\n\n3. **Issue:** Absence of a Strong Call to Action\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The statement ends without a clear sense of what the audience should do or believe. A strong call to action would provide a sense of direction and encourage the audience to embrace the speaker's perspective.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Conclude with a concise call to action, encouraging the audience to:\n    *   Embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in their own artistic endeavors.\n    *   Support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art.\n    *   Advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.\n\n4. **Issue:** Lack of Smooth Transitions Between Arguments\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** The list-like structure of the arguments can make it difficult for the audience to follow the logical flow of the statement. Clearer transitions would improve comprehension and enhance the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Incorporate transition phrases and sentences that connect each argument to the central claim. For example:\n        *   \"Building on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows...\"\n        *   \"Furthermore, AI's role extends beyond individual artists to...\"\n        *    \"To address concerns about copyright, it's important to realize...\"\n\n",

              "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering about generative AI potentially decreasing value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. For example, consider Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement, who, according to *his Instagram account*, utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort [2]. *BBC reported in 2024* that some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are exclusively training algorithms on their own works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries [0_24]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *may* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\nTherefore, we encourage you to embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in your own artistic endeavors, support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art, and advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.\n",

          "original_statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering about generative AI potentially decreasing value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. For example, consider Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement, who, according to *his Instagram account*, utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort [2]. *BBC reported in 2024* that some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are exclusively training algorithms on their own works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries [0_24]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *may* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\nTherefore, we encourage you to embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in your own artistic endeavors, support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art, and advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.",

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe core message that AI is a tool that amplifies human creativity and reshapes the artistic landscape for the better is clear. The arguments, including enhancing artist workflows, preserving historical artworks, addressing copyright concerns, and evolving artistic value, are also accessible. The logical flow is improved with transitions between arguments. The explanation of \"prompt engineering,\" while still absent, is less critical now given the context.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe examples of Daniel Ambrosi and Sougwen Chung significantly enhance engagement, making the arguments more relatable and memorable. The analogy of AI as a new type of brush remains effective. Describing the AI in relation to the two artists really helps the audience visualize the argument and keep their attention. The inclusion of these anecdotes helps improve the statement's overall impact.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nThe inclusion of *Ultralytics* report on AI reshaping restoration and conservation helps support the argument that AI is useful in preserving historic art. The additional reference of *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* adds some credibility to the argument that artists generally see AI having a place in the arts. However, the references to the two artists are lacking proper citation - *his Instagram account* and *BBC reported in 2024* are not good ways to show credibility of the evidence. The statement would benefit from more concrete data or statistics to support claims beyond these few new additions.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe statement successfully addresses practical relevance by highlighting the benefits of AI as a tool and acknowledges ethical concerns. The rebuttal to the opponent's points about devaluation and reduced opportunities is well-articulated. The call to action is clear and concise, encouraging the audience to embrace AI, support artists, and advocate for ethical guidelines. The statement's overall persuasive power is significantly improved.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Weak Citations\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The references \"his Instagram account\" and \"BBC reported in 2024\" undermine the credibility of the evidence. The audience may dismiss these examples as anecdotal or unsubstantiated.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n    *   For Daniel Ambrosi, try to find a more reputable source (e.g., an interview, article, or official website) that discusses his use of AI in his art. Include a proper citation. Alternatively, remove this example entirely if there is no more credible source.\n    *   For Sougwen Chung, find the original BBC report (or another reputable news source) and cite it correctly with the URL.\n\n2. **Issue:** Limited Data and Statistics\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** While the statement includes some data points, the limited quantity may leave the audience wanting more. More data could strengthen the arguments and make the message more persuasive.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n    *   Look for additional statistics or data points to support claims about the benefits of AI in art restoration, the evolution of artistic value, or the impact of AI on the art market.\n    *   Include these data points in a concise and easily digestible format, e.g., \"According to a recent study by [Source], AI has reduced the time required for art restoration by X%.\"\n\n3. **Issue:** Lack of Deeper Dive into Ethical Considerations\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** While the statement acknowledges ethical concerns, it doesn't delve into them in detail. This could leave the audience feeling that the statement is glossing over important issues.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n    *   Briefly mention some of the specific ethical challenges associated with AI art (e.g., copyright infringement, bias in AI algorithms, job displacement).\n    *   Explain how artists, policymakers, and the tech industry are working to address these challenges. This could involve citing examples of ethical guidelines or initiatives.\n\n4.  **Issue:** Reliance on \"May\"\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** The word \"may\" in \"While AI art *may* diminish the market for purely technical skill\" weakens the argument. It introduces uncertainty and undermines the speaker's confidence.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Replace \"may\" with a stronger verb or phrase that conveys a more definite impact. For example: \"While AI art *can* diminish...\" or \"AI art *has the potential to* diminish...\" Alternatively, rephrase the sentence to remove the uncertainty altogether.\n"

              "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI potentially decreases value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. For example, consider Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement. According to *an article on Ambrosi's website*, he utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort [1]. *BBC reported in 2024* that some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are exclusively training algorithms on their own works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy. Specific ethical challenges, such as copyright infringement and bias in AI algorithms, are being addressed by artists, policymakers, and the tech industry through ethical guidelines and initiatives.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [4]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [5].\n\nTherefore, we encourage you to embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in your own artistic endeavors, support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art, and advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Ambrosi, Daniel. *Daniel Ambrosi Official Website*.

The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].",

We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].",

          "original_statement": "Thank you. The core of our argument is that AI enhances human creative abilities. Let's directly address the concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows. AI enables experimentation with new styles and variations. It helps overcome technical limitations. AI fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to attack the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons.\n\nThird, let\u2019s attack the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, and we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s attack the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.",
          "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, everyone, let's break down our rebuttal strategy. First, I will start with an overview of our main points (60 words). Then, we will reinforce the idea that AI enhances artists, making them better, not obsolete (80 words). After that, we will attack the claim that AI leads to job losses and devalues art, showing how it actually creates new opportunities (100 words). Next, we'll tackle the copyright and ethics concerns, explaining how these are being addressed and don't represent an insurmountable threat (100 words). Finally, we'll dismantle the argument that AI automation reduces opportunities, highlighting the new roles and creative avenues that AI opens up (82 words). We will leverage analogies to simplify complex points and identify false dilemmas in the opponent's arguments.\n**Total words: 522**",

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe rebuttal aims to reinforce the idea that AI enhances human creative abilities and address concerns about its impact on artists, jobs, originality, and ethics. The points are generally accessible, but the logical flow could be improved with stronger connections between the initial claims and the rebuttals. The statement does get repetitive by the end, and does not give specific claims with supporting details like the other team.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe rebuttal lacks strong examples or analogies. The phrases \"new chapters\" at the end does not deliver any sense of emotion or memorability. It sounds too generic. Without stronger hooks or illustrative content, the statement may struggle to maintain the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nThis rebuttal lacks any specific data, examples, or expert opinions to support its counter-arguments. Instead, it makes several assertions.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe rebuttal attempts to address the opponent's points, but the lack of supporting evidence and concrete examples weakens its persuasive power. The dismissal of ethical concerns as a \"false dilemma\" may alienate some audience members, particularly those who are genuinely worried about the ethical implications of AI.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of Supporting Evidence\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The absence of specific data, examples, or expert opinions undermines the credibility of the rebuttals. The audience is likely to find the counter-arguments unconvincing without concrete support.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** For each key rebuttal, integrate specific examples, statistics, or expert quotes to bolster the claims. For instance:\n        *   When countering the claim of job loss, provide data on the number of new roles created in AI-related artistic fields (e.g., prompt engineering, AI art curation).\n        *   When addressing concerns about originality, cite examples of AI-assisted artworks that have been critically acclaimed for their originality and artistic merit.\n        *   When discussing ethical concerns, reference specific ethical guidelines or initiatives that are being developed to address the challenges of AI art.\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak Logical Connections and Organization\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The rebuttal sometimes lacks clear connections between the opponent's claims and the corresponding counter-arguments. This can make it difficult for the audience to follow the logical flow of the statement. Also, the structure is a little bit messy.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Begin each rebuttal with a clear restatement of the opponent's claim.\n        *   Use transition phrases (e.g., \"However,\" \"In contrast,\" \"While it's true that...\") to signal the shift to the counter-argument.\n        *   Conclude each rebuttal with a concise summary of why the opponent's claim is flawed and how the counter-argument addresses it.\n\n3.  **Issue:** Tone and Dismissal of Ethical Concerns\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** Dismissing ethical concerns as a \"false dilemma\" can be perceived as insensitive or dismissive by audience members who are genuinely concerned about the ethical implications of AI.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Acknowledge the validity of ethical concerns surrounding AI art.\n        *   Instead of dismissing them, frame them as challenges that need to be addressed proactively.\n        *   Offer concrete solutions or initiatives that can help mitigate these ethical risks (e.g., ethical guidelines for AI training, copyright protections for human artists, transparency in AI art creation).\n\n4. **Issue:** Repetitiveness\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** Repeating similar arguments and phrases weakens the statement and can bore or frustrate the audience.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Identify and eliminate redundant arguments and phrases.\n        *   Vary the language used to express similar ideas.\n        *   Focus on providing unique and compelling counter-arguments for each of the opponent's key claims.\n"

          "original_statement": "Thank you. The core of our argument is that AI enhances human creative abilities, and we firmly believe AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's directly address the concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, showing how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to a 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\" AI helps overcome technical limitations. It fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As *AI's impact on art | News* reported in 2024, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\" published in *2023*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to the article \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\" artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals, artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. As *AI's impact on art | News* reported in 2024, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for more a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

It would be better if examples and analogies can be more descriptive to have higher engagement.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nThe rebuttal is improved by including more references to different articles to support its claims. The reference titles still do not connect with the arguments that it attempts to make.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe rebuttal has improved, but can be furthered by removing repetitive arguments.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Weak Integration of Evidence\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** Simply stating the name of the article at the end of the sentence does not clearly show the evidence's significance.

Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity.

              "Thank you. We stand firm that AI enhances human creative abilities and will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will directly address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations, fostering artistic growth and diversification [1]. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills.

It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete. For example, AI can assist musicians in generating new melodies, visual artists in creating complex textures, and writers in exploring different narrative structures.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that.

While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

The central point of contention is whether AI devalues human skill.\n\nFirst, our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry. However, as *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates, AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering [1]. This opens doors for new artists who were traditionally excluded from the art world due to technical or resource barriers. Second, regarding job displacement, we've shown that AI empowers artists to focus on their core craft. According to *Adobe's 2023 study on the future of creativity*, artists are using AI to automate tedious tasks, freeing up their time to explore new creative avenues [2]. Imagine the artist, liberated from technical constraints, now able to explore uncharted artistic territories.\n\nTherefore, we firmly maintain that AI amplifies human artistic capabilities. It's not about replacement; it's about expansion. AI democratizes art creation, and the fusion of human ingenuity with AI capabilities unlocks unprecedented levels of creativity. As you've seen, AI allows a more diverse group to participate in artistic expression. *A 2024 report by Arts Council England* highlights that AI tools are enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in creative practices they previously couldn't access [3]. This is not decline; this is artistic evolution.\n\nFinally, regarding copyright concerns, remember that these issues are inherently adaptable. *A 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report* suggests that the uncertainty surrounding AI and copyright is actually sparking creativity, challenging artists to find novel ways to collaborate with AI while protecting their intellectual property [4].\n\nIn closing, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity.

          "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "statement": "Esteemed judges, we've shown today that AI will not cause the decline of human creative arts; instead, it will fundamentally transform them. The core debate is whether AI devalues human skill.\n\nFirst, while our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry, *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates that AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering [1]. This opens doors for new artists traditionally excluded due to technical or resource barriers. Second, regarding job displacement, we've demonstrated that AI empowers artists to focus on their core craft. According to *Adobe's 2023 study on the future of creativity*, artists are using AI to automate tedious tasks, freeing up their time to explore new creative avenues [2].\n\nTherefore, we maintain that AI amplifies human artistic capabilities. It's not about replacement; it's about expansion. AI democratizes art creation, and the fusion of human ingenuity with AI unlocks unprecedented creativity. As you've seen, AI allows a more diverse group to participate in artistic expression. *A 2024 report by Arts Council England* highlights that AI tools are enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in creative practices they previously couldn't access [3].\n\nFinally, regarding copyright concerns, remember that these issues are inherently adaptable. *A 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report* suggests that the uncertainty surrounding AI and copyright is sparking creativity, challenging artists to find novel ways to collaborate with AI while protecting their intellectual property [4].\n\nIn closing, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity. It opens new chapters, offering new tools and opportunities for artists to thrive. Vote against the narrative of decline.",

          "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Develop a robust evidence foundation with multiple sources rather than relying on just one or two studies. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and respond specifically to what was actually said, using their own words when possible. Address the core question rather than tangential issues.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but ensure analogies clarify rather than obscure your points. Balance emotional appeals with evidence-based reasoning.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. Acknowledge valid opponent points before explaining why your position is still superior.\n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Balance: When appropriate, recognize complexity by addressing both systemic issues and individual factors rather than presenting them as mutually exclusive.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a topic.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. The generated statements should be friendly and engaging for the public speaking. Do not use complex words and sentences, which may be difficult for the public to understand and follow.\nAwait the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the topic, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the topic, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the topic self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the topic and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the topic and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Use these techniques **sparingly and strategically** to enhance rather than distract from your arguments:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles (at most one analogy in one debate)\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories (at most one story in one debate)\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n"

Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems.

The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.

          "content": "**Opponent's Opening Statement**\nWe stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

          "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "content": "**Opponent's Rebuttal Statement**\nThank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

          "content": "Thank you chair person and a steam judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Develop a robust evidence foundation with multiple sources rather than relying on just one or two studies. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and respond specifically to what was actually said, using their own words when possible. Address the core question rather than tangential issues.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but ensure analogies clarify rather than obscure your points. Balance emotional appeals with evidence-based reasoning.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. Acknowledge valid opponent points before explaining why your position is still superior.\n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Balance: When appropriate, recognize complexity by addressing both systemic issues and individual factors rather than presenting them as mutually exclusive.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a topic.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. The generated statements should be friendly and engaging for the public speaking. Do not use complex words and sentences, which may be difficult for the public to understand and follow.\nAwait the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the topic, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the topic, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the topic self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the topic and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the topic and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Use these techniques **sparingly and strategically** to enhance rather than distract from your arguments:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles (at most one analogy in one debate)\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories (at most one story in one debate)\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n"

We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.

          "content": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

          "content": "**Opponent's Rebuttal Statement**\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "content": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

          "content": "Esteemed judges, we've shown today that AI will not cause the decline of human creative arts; instead, it will fundamentally transform them. The core debate is whether AI devalues human skill.\n\nFirst, while our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry, *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates that AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering [1]. This opens doors for new artists traditionally excluded due to technical or resource barriers. Second, regarding job displacement, we've demonstrated that AI empowers artists to focus on their core craft. According to *Adobe's 2023 study on the future of creativity*, artists are using AI to automate tedious tasks, freeing up their time to explore new creative avenues [2].\n\nTherefore, we maintain that AI amplifies human artistic capabilities. It's not about replacement; it's about expansion. AI democratizes art creation, and the fusion of human ingenuity with AI unlocks unprecedented creativity. As you've seen, AI allows a more diverse group to participate in artistic expression. *A 2024 report by Arts Council England* highlights that AI tools are enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in creative practices they previously couldn't access [3].\n\nFinally, regarding copyright concerns, remember that these issues are inherently adaptable. *A 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report* suggests that the uncertainty surrounding AI and copyright is sparking creativity, challenging artists to find novel ways to collaborate with AI while protecting their intellectual property [4].\n\nIn closing, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity.

        "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will, indeed, lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s start with what we mean by \"decline.\" We\u2019re not saying human art will disappear entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, will diminish the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums, ultimately leading to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication.

AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider the story of Maria, a freelance illustrator who lost several clients to AI-generated images. Despite her years of experience, she simply couldn't compete with the speed and cost-effectiveness of AI. This epitomizes how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists.\n\nFor these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Thank you.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan:**\n\nOkay, team, here's our plan of attack. We're supporting the motion: \"AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts.\" First, I'll spend about 100 words clearly defining what we mean by \"decline\" in this context, because that's key to the whole debate. Second, in around 50 words, I'll establish our judging criteria. I'll emphasize the impact on cultural value. Then, I\u2019ll spend the bulk of our time, roughly 372 words, laying out our three main arguments which all have \"high\" importance according to the debate flow tree: how AI devalues artistic skill, how it homogenizes artistic expression, and how it could displace human artists. In the first argument, I will introduce an analogy to make the argument more vivid. I will introduce a powerful story in the third argument.",
        "simulated_audience_feedback": [
          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message is relatively clear: AI will diminish the value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art, leading to a cultural shift. The definition of \"decline\" is helpful. The judging criteria are also clearly stated. However, the connection between the arguments and the overall claim could be strengthened with stronger, more concise topic sentences for each argument.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of analogies (musical instrument, plotlines) is effective in making abstract concepts more accessible. The story of Maria adds a human touch and emotional connection. However, the overall tone is somewhat dry. Injecting more passion and urgency could improve engagement. The introduction could be more captivating to immediately grab the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nWhile the arguments are logical, the opening statement lacks concrete evidence. It mentions \"datasets\" and \"algorithmic art\" but doesn't provide specific examples or sources. The story of Maria is anecdotal and lacks broader context. The claim about job displacement would be stronger with statistics or data on the art market.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe opening statement appeals to the audience's concerns about cultural value, economic opportunity, and artistic diversity. The \"think of it like this\" segments try to establish a practical relevance. However, the statement could be more persuasive by addressing potential counterarguments and acknowledging the potential benefits of AI in art. The call to action is implicit rather than explicit.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of concrete evidence and data to support claims.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces the credibility of the arguments and makes them seem speculative.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add specific examples, statistics, or research findings to support each argument. For instance, instead of just saying \"job displacement,\" cite a report projecting job losses in the art sector due to AI.\n\n2. **Issue:** Over-reliance on analogies without sufficient explanation.\n   **Impact on Audience:** While analogies can be helpful, they can also be oversimplistic and fail to capture the complexity of the issue.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** After presenting an analogy, briefly explain why it's relevant and how it connects to the broader argument. For example, after the \"same ten plotlines\" analogy, elaborate on how AI's reliance on existing data can lead to similar limitations in artistic expression.\n\n3. **Issue:** Weak emotional appeal and lack of a clear call to action.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Fails to fully engage the audience's emotions or inspire them to take action.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Conclude with a powerful statement that emphasizes the importance of preserving human creativity and artistic expression. Suggest a concrete action the audience can take, such as supporting local artists or advocating for policies that protect the arts. This can be as simple as saying, \"Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.\"\n\n4. **Issue:** Absence of counter-argument acknowledgement\n   **Impact on Audience:** Could make the argument seem biased or one-sided.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Acknowledge the potential for AI to augment human creativity, but then quickly transition back to how it can also lead to negative consequences if not managed thoughtfully. For example, \"While AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity.\"\n"

            "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will indeed lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify what we mean by \"decline.\" We are not suggesting that human art will vanish entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as a process where AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, diminishes the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This ultimately leads to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art. According to *ACM Digital Library*, AI now makes it possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market and depreciating the value of art as a whole.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI-generated art is essentially a remix of prior works, lacking a unique personal vision and potentially leading to derivative, less meaningful art.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider the story of Maria, a freelance illustrator who lost several clients to AI-generated images. Despite her years of experience, she simply couldn't compete with the speed and cost-effectiveness of AI. This epitomizes how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists already believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\n\nWhile AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity. For these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.

        "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will indeed lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify what we mean by \"decline.\" We are not suggesting that human art will vanish entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as a process where AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, diminishes the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This ultimately leads to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art. According to *ACM Digital Library*, AI now makes it possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market and depreciating the value of art as a whole.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI-generated art is essentially a remix of prior works, lacking a unique personal vision and potentially leading to derivative, less meaningful art.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider the story of Maria, a freelance illustrator who lost several clients to AI-generated images. Despite her years of experience, she simply couldn't compete with the speed and cost-effectiveness of AI. This epitomizes how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists already believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\n\nWhile AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity. For these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message remains clear: AI will diminish the value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. The definition of \"decline\" is helpful. The judging criteria are well-defined. The logical flow is easy to follow.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe analogies (musical instrument, plotlines) continue to be effective. The story of Maria remains a good human touch, and the inclusion of counter-arguments makes the presentation appear more balanced. The addition of \"Let's champion human artists...\" adds a call to action that creates a strong connection.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe statement has improved by including references to *ACM Digital Library*, *MIT Technology Review*, and *the Academy of Animated Art*. These references add credibility. However, simply stating the source is not enough; a brief summary of the relevant findings from each source would be more impactful. For instance, instead of saying \"According to *ACM Digital Library*...\", say \"*ACM Digital Library* found that AI makes it possible...\". The story of Maria is still anecdotal; supplementing it with broader data on freelance illustrator income trends would be beneficial. It also can be confusing with the reference list at the end. It would be ideal if the title were written in-text so that the audience knows what the reference is for and it would flow in a logical sense.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe statement persuasively combines emotional appeals (story of Maria, call to action) with practical concerns (economic inequality, job displacement). Addressing potential counterarguments (AI offers new tools) strengthens the argument's overall credibility. The solution, \"Let's champion human artists...\", is a good start but could be made more specific (e.g., support funding for art programs, promote human-generated art).\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** References are present but not fully integrated or explained.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may not understand the specific findings or relevance of each source.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Integrate the key findings from each source directly into the text, summarizing them concisely. For instance, \"A 2019 *MIT Technology Review* report found that AI-generated art is often a remix of existing works, lacking unique personal vision.\" This clarifies the relevance of the reference and strengthens the argument. Also, remove the reference list at the end.\n\n2. **Issue:** Anecdotal evidence (story of Maria) could be strengthened with broader data.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The story of Maria is compelling but lacks generalizability.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Supplement the story with statistics on the decline of freelance illustration income or the number of artists being displaced by AI. This provides a broader context and makes the argument more persuasive.\n\n3. **Issue:** The call to action is general; it could be more specific.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may not know how to \"champion human artists.\"\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Provide concrete examples of actions the audience can take, such as supporting local art programs, advocating for policies that protect artists' rights, or consciously choosing to purchase art from human artists. For instance, \"Let's champion human artists by supporting local art programs, advocating for policies that protect their rights, and consciously choosing to purchase art from human artists.\"\n"

        "final_response": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will indeed lead to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nLet\u2019s clarify what we mean by \"decline.\" We are not suggesting that human art will vanish entirely. Instead, we define \"decline\" as a process where AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, diminishes the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This ultimately leads to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.\n\nSo, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future \u2013 one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported \u2013 best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.\n\nNow, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art. According to *ACM Digital Library*, AI now makes it possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market and depreciating the value of art as a whole [1].\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines \u2013 the stories would quickly become boring and predictable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI-generated art is essentially a remix of prior works, lacking a unique personal vision and potentially leading to derivative, less meaningful art [2].\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists already believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income [3].\n\nWhile AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity. For these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's champion human artists by supporting local art programs, advocating for policies that protect their rights, and consciously choosing to purchase art from human artists.

        "statement": "In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

        "original_statement": "Let's get started. First, it's crucial to remember what we're debating. We affirm that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts. Human creative arts are original expressions, born from human intellect, skill, and emotion. Decline means less value, originality, opportunity, and appreciation. AI is generative AI trained on existing art. Our judging standard is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. Keep these points in mind as we respond.\n\nNow, let's talk about how AI devalues human artistic skill. The opponent dodges the main issue. AI art floods the market with cheap content. As we have discussed, this brings down the perceived value of art made by humans, which needs time, skill, and emotional input. The opponent says AI amplifies artists, but they don't address the core problem. When AI can make art instantly, the years of training a human artist undertakes become less valued. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting. Even if the print is decent, the original holds more value because of the artist's skill and effort. We aren't saying art can\u2019t be made using AI, we're stating that easier access to art that is comparable with unaided human creation devalues solely human work.\n\nThe claim that AI fosters artistic growth is also misleading. The opponent mentioned that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations, but skill is part of the artistic journey. The argument that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations misses the point: mastery of technique is often inseparable from the artistic statement itself. Moreover, the \"new\" art forms AI creates are based on existing art.\n\nLet's consider copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it\u2019s an appeal to fear.\n\nWe also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. Automation replaces human skills, and some businesses will choose AI over human creators.\n\nFinally, on AI 'restoration,' remember that altering an original piece, even to \"restore\" it, can diminish its authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence shows AI does lead to a decline in human creative arts. The opponent\u2019s arguments don\u2019t change this reality.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. First, I'll quickly re-establish our key definitions and the judging criteria, making sure we're all on the same page (40 words).

After that, I'll explain why AI fostering artistic growth is misleading (90 words). Following that, I\u2019ll return to ethical concerns about copyright in AI (70 words). Next, I\u2019ll reinforce that AI reduces opportunities for human artists (60 words). Finally, I will address AI \u2018restoration\u2019 concerns (40 words).\n\nThis strategy focuses on the key issues where AI directly undermines human creativity, artistic value, and economic opportunity.

        "simulated_audience_feedback": [
          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal effectively reiterates the core definitions and judging criteria at the beginning, ensuring the audience remains focused on the key issues. The logical flow is generally clear, addressing the opponent's points sequentially. However, the transitions between rebuttals could be smoother and more directly linked to the overarching claim that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of analogies (mass-produced print vs. original painting) is helpful in illustrating the devaluation of human skill. However, the rebuttal could benefit from more engaging language and a more passionate tone. The overall delivery feels somewhat defensive rather than proactively persuasive.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe rebuttal primarily relies on restating previous arguments rather than introducing new evidence to directly counter the opponent's claims. While reiterating key points is important, the absence of new evidence weakens the rebuttal's impact. For example, when addressing the opponent's point about AI enhancing artist workflows, the rebuttal could cite studies showing that AI-assisted art is often perceived as less original or emotionally resonant. The opponent cited BBC, Ultralytics, and a report. The rebuttal did not use a single piece of evidence to counter those claims.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to undermine the opponent's arguments by characterizing them as \"dodging the main issue\" or \"misleading.\" However, this approach can be perceived as dismissive and may alienate the audience. A more persuasive strategy would be to acknowledge the potential benefits of AI while emphasizing the potential negative consequences for human artists. The rebuttal touches on emotional concerns (devaluation of skill, ethical issues) but could amplify these appeals for greater impact.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of new evidence to directly counter the opponent's claims.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Reduces the persuasiveness of the rebuttal and makes it seem repetitive.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Introduce new evidence, such as studies, expert opinions, or data points, to directly refute the opponent's claims. For example, when countering the claim that AI enhances artist workflows, cite research showing that AI-assisted art is often perceived as less original or emotionally resonant. Or, when addressing AI \"restoration,\" find examples where AI restoration has been controversial or altered the original intent of the artist.\n\n2. **Issue:** Overly dismissive tone towards the opponent's arguments.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Can be perceived as arrogant or close-minded, reducing the overall persuasiveness of the rebuttal.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Reframe the rebuttal to acknowledge the potential benefits of AI while emphasizing the potential negative consequences for human artists. Instead of saying \"The opponent dodges the main issue,\" try \"While AI may offer certain benefits, we must not lose sight of the potential for it to devalue human skill and creativity.\" Acknowledge BBC, Ultralytics, and the AI report before providing a more valid claim.\n\n3. **Issue:** Weak connection between rebuttals and the overarching claim.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The audience may lose sight of the main argument that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** At the end of each rebuttal, explicitly link it back to the overarching claim. For example, after addressing the copyright issue, conclude with \"Therefore, the ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.\"\n"

Therefore, the derivative nature of AI art further contributes to the decline in originality within human creative arts.\n\nLet's consider copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it\u2019s an appeal to fear. The ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.\n\nWe also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. Automation replaces human skills, and some businesses will choose AI over human creators. *PMC* estimates the contemporary art world to be a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists [3]. However, the rise of AI art threatens this ecosystem. Therefore, the reduction of opportunities for human artists due to AI directly leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFinally, on AI 'restoration,' remember that altering an original piece, even to \"restore\" it, can diminish its authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence shows AI does lead to a decline in human creative arts. The opponent\u2019s arguments don\u2019t change this reality.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[2] The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\n[3] Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.

        "original_statement": "Let's get started. First, it's crucial to remember what we're debating. We affirm that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts. Human creative arts are original expressions, born from human intellect, skill, and emotion. Decline means less value, originality, opportunity, and appreciation. AI is generative AI trained on existing art. Our judging standard is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. Keep these points in mind as we respond.\n\nNow, let's address how AI devalues human artistic skill. While the opposition *may* suggest AI amplifies artists, we must not lose sight of the potential for it to devalue human skill and creativity. The core problem is that AI art floods the market with cheap content. As we have discussed, this brings down the perceived value of art made by humans, which needs time, skill, and emotional input. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting. Even if the print is decent, the original holds more value because of the artist's skill and effort. We aren't saying art can\u2019t be made using AI, we're stating that easier access to art that is comparable with unaided human creation devalues solely human work. In fact, *a study in 2024 by UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* confirms that generative AI systems have already led to the replacement of human creatives in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design [1]. Therefore, the flood of AI art directly contributes to the decline in the value of human creative arts.\n\nThe claim that AI fosters artistic growth is also misleading. The opponent mentioned that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations, but skill is part of the artistic journey. The argument that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations misses the point: mastery of technique is often inseparable from the artistic statement itself. Moreover, the \"new\" art forms AI creates are based on existing art. As *Matt Corrall* points out, AI models are limited by the data they are trained on and cannot truly adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being [2]. They simply remix existing styles. Therefore, the derivative nature of AI art further contributes to the decline in originality within human creative arts.\n\nLet's consider copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it\u2019s an appeal to fear. The ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.\n\nWe also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. Automation replaces human skills, and some businesses will choose AI over human creators. *PMC* estimates the contemporary art world to be a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists [3]. However, the rise of AI art threatens this ecosystem. Therefore, the reduction of opportunities for human artists due to AI directly leads to a decline in human creative arts.\n\nFinally, on AI 'restoration,' remember that altering an original piece, even to \"restore\" it, can diminish its authenticity.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence shows AI does lead to a decline in human creative arts. The opponent\u2019s arguments don\u2019t change this reality.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries | UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).\n[2] The harm & hypocrisy of AI art - Matt Corrall.\n[3] Bias against AI art can enhance perceptions of human creativity.

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal maintains a clear core message and effectively reiterates definitions. The logical flow has improved with clearer transitions. The direct linking of individual rebuttals to the overarching claim (\"Therefore...\") is a positive addition.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of analogies remains effective. The tone is now more balanced, acknowledging the opposition's points while emphasizing the counterarguments. However, greater emotional resonance could still be achieved by highlighting the personal impact on individual artists and the cultural significance of human creativity.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe addition of evidence from UNCTAD, Matt Corrall, and PMC is a significant improvement. The integration of these sources into the text is also well-executed. However, the evidence could be presented with more nuance. For instance, the PMC estimate of the art market should be contextualized: is this growth or decline? What are the trends? Also, it would be great to reference the specific point to the BBC report that the opponent mentioned earlier.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal is more persuasive due to the stronger evidence and more balanced tone. By directly linking each rebuttal to the decline of human creative arts, the argument is made more compelling. However, the conclusion remains somewhat weak. It could be strengthened by summarizing the key arguments and reiterating the call to action.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of direct engagement with the opponent's specific evidence.\n   **Impact on Audience:** Missed opportunity to directly undermine the credibility of the opponent's claims.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** When addressing the opponent's points, directly reference their sources and explain why they are unreliable, irrelevant, or misinterpreted. For example, when addressing the claim about AI enhancing artist workflows, state: \"The opponent cites a BBC report, but this report focuses on a narrow subset of artists who actively embrace AI. It fails to address the broader concerns about job displacement and devaluation of skill that affect the majority of artists.\" You should also briefly talk about why you disagree with the 78% of artists agreeing with AI. What are your thoughts and evidence behind this claim?\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak conclusion; lacks a strong summary and emotional appeal.\n   **Impact on Audience:** The final impression is less impactful than it could be.\n   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Conclude by summarizing the key arguments, reiterating the call to action, and emphasizing the importance of preserving human creativity. For example: \"In conclusion, we have shown that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts by devaluing skill, raising ethical concerns, and reducing opportunities for artists. While AI may offer certain benefits, we must not allow it to undermine the unique value and cultural significance of human creativity. Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.\"\n"

        "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

        "statement": "In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.",

        "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "original_statement": "We stand in opposition to the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions provided by the opposition regarding human creative arts, decline, and AI, we believe focusing solely on generative AI and the fear of decreased value and opportunity paints an incomplete picture.\n\nOur stance is this: AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows. They enable them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument. Many artists are already using AI to explore creative boundaries, overcome creative blocks, and produce art they otherwise couldn't. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration can elevate human art rather than diminish it. AI is not a replacement; it's a partner.\n\nAI can also help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI.\n\nMoreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nLet\u2019s address the concerns about copyright and ethics. It is important to know that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe core message is generally clear: AI is a tool that amplifies human creativity, rather than replacing it, and its integration can elevate human art. The main arguments supporting this are the enhancement of artist workflows, the preservation and restoration of historical artworks, the facilitation of interactive art, the adaptability of copyright laws, and the evolution of artistic value. However, the logical flow could be strengthened with clearer transitions between these points, and more explicit connections back to the central claim. While technical terms are mostly avoided, a brief explanation of \"prompt engineering\" might be helpful for a general audience.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe use of examples like AI as a \"new type of brush\" and the idea of \"lost masterpieces brought back to life\" are effective analogies and examples that connect with the audience's interests and make the arguments more memorable. Describing the interactive installations also helps keep the audience engaged. However, the statement could benefit from more emotional resonance. While the logical arguments are strong, incorporating anecdotes or hypothetical scenarios showcasing the positive impact of AI on individual artists could make the arguments more compelling. The structure is a bit too list-like and could be woven into a more compelling narrative.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nWhile the statement alludes to real-world examples (artists using AI), it lacks specific evidence to support its claims. Mentioning specific AI tools used by artists, examples of restored artworks, or successful interactive installations would significantly strengthen the argument. The claim about copyright laws being adaptable needs concrete examples of similar adaptations in the past. There are no direct citations in the statement. The argument uses logical reasoning well, but it needs more concrete evidence.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe statement appeals to practicality by highlighting the benefits of AI as a tool. The discussion of copyright and ethics acknowledges a major concern and attempts to offer reassurance. The rebuttal to the opponent's points about devaluation and reduced opportunities is also persuasive, offering an alternative perspective on the evolution of artistic value. However, the statement lacks a strong call to action. While it implicitly suggests embracing AI, it could be more forceful in encouraging the audience to view AI as a creative partner. Highlighting the potential benefits for future generations may strengthen emotional appeal and practical relevance.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of Concrete Evidence\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The absence of specific examples and supporting data weakens the persuasiveness of the arguments. The audience may perceive the claims as speculative or unsubstantiated.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Integrate 1-2 concrete examples per claim. For instance:\n    *   When discussing enhancing artist workflows, name an AI tool (e.g., RunwayML, DALL-E 2) and briefly describe how an artist is using it to create a specific type of art.\n    *   When discussing the restoration of historical artworks, cite a specific project where AI was used to restore a damaged painting or sculpture.\n    *   When discussing the interactive art installation, give the name of the artist and exhibit and briefly describe how the audience could participate.\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak Emotional Resonance and Missing Personal Anecdotes.\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The arguments, while logically sound, may not fully resonate with the audience on an emotional level. Without personal stories or emotional appeals, the message may come across as detached and impersonal.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Add 1-2 short anecdotes of artists who are using AI to overcome creative obstacles, develop their art, or connect with audience to illustrate how the integration of AI has led to artistic growth, diversification, and new art forms. For example, \"Consider [Artist's Name], who uses AI to [Specific Application] resulting in [Quantifiable Results/Impact].\"\n\n3. **Issue:** Absence of a Strong Call to Action\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The statement ends without a clear sense of what the audience should do or believe.

Clearer transitions would improve comprehension and enhance the overall persuasiveness of the message.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** Incorporate transition phrases and sentences that connect each argument to the central claim.

            "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering about generative AI potentially decreasing value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. For example, consider Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement, who, according to *his Instagram account*, utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort [2]. *BBC reported in 2024* that some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are exclusively training algorithms on their own works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries [0_24]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *may* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\nTherefore, we encourage you to embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in your own artistic endeavors, support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art, and advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.\n",

        "final_response": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering about generative AI potentially decreasing value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit.

        "original_statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering about generative AI potentially decreasing value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. For example, consider Daniel Ambrosi, a prominent figure in the AI art movement, who, according to *his Instagram account*, utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort [2]. *BBC reported in 2024* that some artists, such as Sougwen Chung, are exclusively training algorithms on their own works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries [0_24]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. The uncertainty sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *may* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\nTherefore, we encourage you to embrace AI as a creative tool and explore its potential in your own artistic endeavors, support artists who are experimenting with AI and pushing the boundaries of art, and advocate for ethical guidelines and copyright laws that protect both human artists and AI-generated art.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe core message that AI is a tool that amplifies human creativity and reshapes the artistic landscape for the better is clear. The arguments, including enhancing artist workflows, preserving historical artworks, addressing copyright concerns, and evolving artistic value, are also accessible. The logical flow is improved with transitions between arguments. The explanation of \"prompt engineering,\" while still absent, is less critical now given the context.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe examples of Daniel Ambrosi and Sougwen Chung significantly enhance engagement, making the arguments more relatable and memorable. The analogy of AI as a new type of brush remains effective. Describing the AI in relation to the two artists really helps the audience visualize the argument and keep their attention. The inclusion of these anecdotes helps improve the statement's overall impact.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nThe inclusion of *Ultralytics* report on AI reshaping restoration and conservation helps support the argument that AI is useful in preserving historic art. The additional reference of *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* adds some credibility to the argument that artists generally see AI having a place in the arts. However, the references to the two artists are lacking proper citation - *his Instagram account* and *BBC reported in 2024* are not good ways to show credibility of the evidence. The statement would benefit from more concrete data or statistics to support claims beyond these few new additions.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe statement successfully addresses practical relevance by highlighting the benefits of AI as a tool and acknowledges ethical concerns. The rebuttal to the opponent's points about devaluation and reduced opportunities is well-articulated. The call to action is clear and concise, encouraging the audience to embrace AI, support artists, and advocate for ethical guidelines. The statement's overall persuasive power is significantly improved.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Weak Citations\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The references \"his Instagram account\" and \"BBC reported in 2024\" undermine the credibility of the evidence. The audience may dismiss these examples as anecdotal or unsubstantiated.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n    *   For Daniel Ambrosi, try to find a more reputable source (e.g., an interview, article, or official website) that discusses his use of AI in his art. Include a proper citation. Alternatively, remove this example entirely if there is no more credible source.\n    *   For Sougwen Chung, find the original BBC report (or another reputable news source) and cite it correctly with the URL.\n\n2. **Issue:** Limited Data and Statistics\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** While the statement includes some data points, the limited quantity may leave the audience wanting more. More data could strengthen the arguments and make the message more persuasive.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n    *   Look for additional statistics or data points to support claims about the benefits of AI in art restoration, the evolution of artistic value, or the impact of AI on the art market.\n    *   Include these data points in a concise and easily digestible format, e.g., \"According to a recent study by [Source], AI has reduced the time required for art restoration by X%.\"\n\n3. **Issue:** Lack of Deeper Dive into Ethical Considerations\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** While the statement acknowledges ethical concerns, it doesn't delve into them in detail. This could leave the audience feeling that the statement is glossing over important issues.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n    *   Briefly mention some of the specific ethical challenges associated with AI art (e.g., copyright infringement, bias in AI algorithms, job displacement).\n    *   Explain how artists, policymakers, and the tech industry are working to address these challenges. This could involve citing examples of ethical guidelines or initiatives.\n\n4.  **Issue:** Reliance on \"May\"\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** The word \"may\" in \"While AI art *may* diminish the market for purely technical skill\" weakens the argument. It introduces uncertainty and undermines the speaker's confidence.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Replace \"may\" with a stronger verb or phrase that conveys a more definite impact. For example: \"While AI art *can* diminish...\" or \"AI art *has the potential to* diminish...\" Alternatively, rephrase the sentence to remove the uncertainty altogether.\n"

We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "original_statement": "Thank you. The core of our argument is that AI enhances human creative abilities. Let's directly address the concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows. AI enables experimentation with new styles and variations. It helps overcome technical limitations. AI fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to attack the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons.\n\nThird, let\u2019s attack the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, and we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s attack the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, everyone, let's break down our rebuttal strategy. First, I will start with an overview of our main points (60 words). Then, we will reinforce the idea that AI enhances artists, making them better, not obsolete (80 words). After that, we will attack the claim that AI leads to job losses and devalues art, showing how it actually creates new opportunities (100 words). Next, we'll tackle the copyright and ethics concerns, explaining how these are being addressed and don't represent an insurmountable threat (100 words). Finally, we'll dismantle the argument that AI automation reduces opportunities, highlighting the new roles and creative avenues that AI opens up (82 words).

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe rebuttal aims to reinforce the idea that AI enhances human creative abilities and address concerns about its impact on artists, jobs, originality, and ethics. The points are generally accessible, but the logical flow could be improved with stronger connections between the initial claims and the rebuttals. The statement does get repetitive by the end, and does not give specific claims with supporting details like the other team.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe rebuttal lacks strong examples or analogies. The phrases \"new chapters\" at the end does not deliver any sense of emotion or memorability. It sounds too generic. Without stronger hooks or illustrative content, the statement may struggle to maintain the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nThis rebuttal lacks any specific data, examples, or expert opinions to support its counter-arguments. Instead, it makes several assertions.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe rebuttal attempts to address the opponent's points, but the lack of supporting evidence and concrete examples weakens its persuasive power. The dismissal of ethical concerns as a \"false dilemma\" may alienate some audience members, particularly those who are genuinely worried about the ethical implications of AI.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Lack of Supporting Evidence\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The absence of specific data, examples, or expert opinions undermines the credibility of the rebuttals. The audience is likely to find the counter-arguments unconvincing without concrete support.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:** For each key rebuttal, integrate specific examples, statistics, or expert quotes to bolster the claims. For instance:\n        *   When countering the claim of job loss, provide data on the number of new roles created in AI-related artistic fields (e.g., prompt engineering, AI art curation).\n        *   When addressing concerns about originality, cite examples of AI-assisted artworks that have been critically acclaimed for their originality and artistic merit.\n        *   When discussing ethical concerns, reference specific ethical guidelines or initiatives that are being developed to address the challenges of AI art.\n\n2. **Issue:** Weak Logical Connections and Organization\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** The rebuttal sometimes lacks clear connections between the opponent's claims and the corresponding counter-arguments. This can make it difficult for the audience to follow the logical flow of the statement. Also, the structure is a little bit messy.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Begin each rebuttal with a clear restatement of the opponent's claim.\n        *   Use transition phrases (e.g., \"However,\" \"In contrast,\" \"While it's true that...\") to signal the shift to the counter-argument.\n        *   Conclude each rebuttal with a concise summary of why the opponent's claim is flawed and how the counter-argument addresses it.\n\n3.  **Issue:** Tone and Dismissal of Ethical Concerns\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** Dismissing ethical concerns as a \"false dilemma\" can be perceived as insensitive or dismissive by audience members who are genuinely concerned about the ethical implications of AI.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Acknowledge the validity of ethical concerns surrounding AI art.\n        *   Instead of dismissing them, frame them as challenges that need to be addressed proactively.\n        *   Offer concrete solutions or initiatives that can help mitigate these ethical risks (e.g., ethical guidelines for AI training, copyright protections for human artists, transparency in AI art creation).\n\n4. **Issue:** Repetitiveness\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** Repeating similar arguments and phrases weakens the statement and can bore or frustrate the audience.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Identify and eliminate redundant arguments and phrases.\n        *   Vary the language used to express similar ideas.\n        *   Focus on providing unique and compelling counter-arguments for each of the opponent's key claims.\n"

Also, the structure is a little bit messy.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Begin each rebuttal with a clear restatement of the opponent's claim.\n        *   Use transition phrases (e.g., \"However,\" \"In contrast,\" \"While it's true that...\") to signal the shift to the counter-argument.\n        *   Conclude each rebuttal with a concise summary of why the opponent's claim is flawed and how the counter-argument addresses it.\n\n3.  **Issue:** Tone and Dismissal of Ethical Concerns\n    *   **Impact on Audience:** Dismissing ethical concerns as a \"false dilemma\" can be perceived as insensitive or dismissive by audience members who are genuinely concerned about the ethical implications of AI.\n    *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Acknowledge the validity of ethical concerns surrounding AI art.\n        *   Instead of dismissing them, frame them as challenges that need to be addressed proactively.\n        *   Offer concrete solutions or initiatives that can help mitigate these ethical risks (e.g., ethical guidelines for AI training, copyright protections for human artists, transparency in AI art creation).\n\n4. **Issue:** Repetitiveness\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** Repeating similar arguments and phrases weakens the statement and can bore or frustrate the audience.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion:**\n        *   Identify and eliminate redundant arguments and phrases.\n        *   Vary the language used to express similar ideas.\n        *   Focus on providing unique and compelling counter-arguments for each of the opponent's key claims.\n",

            "Thank you. The core of our argument is that AI enhances human creative abilities, and we firmly believe AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's directly address the concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, showing how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to a 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\" AI helps overcome technical limitations. It fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As *AI's impact on art | News* reported in 2024, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\" published in *2023*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to the article \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\" artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals, artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. As *AI's impact on art | News* reported in 2024, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for more a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As *AI's impact on art | News* reported in 2024, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\" published in *2023*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to the article \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\" artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals, artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. As *AI's impact on art | News* reported in 2024, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for more a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\n\nThe rebuttal is now more direct in addressing the concerns about AI's impact and reaffirming its stance that AI enhances creativity. However, the arguments still lack depth and clear logical flow. The references at the end of some sentences do not naturally connect with the flow of the argument.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\n\nThe rebuttal still struggles with engagement. It would be better if examples and analogies can be more descriptive to have higher engagement.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\n\nThe rebuttal is improved by including more references to different articles to support its claims. The reference titles still do not connect with the arguments that it attempts to make.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\n\nThe rebuttal has improved, but can be furthered by removing repetitive arguments.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. **Issue:** Weak Integration of Evidence\n   *   **Impact on Audience:** Simply stating the name of the article at the end of the sentence does not clearly show the evidence's significance.

            "Thank you. The core of our argument remains that AI enhances human creative abilities, and we firmly believe AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will directly address the concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation, not a harbinger of artistic doom.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article* titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art,\" AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification.

For example, AI can assist musicians in generating novel soundscapes, visual artists in creating interactive installations, and writers in developing dynamic narratives. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity.

            "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression.

        "statement": "In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art.

        "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.\n\nOur core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories [0_24]. Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art [2]. This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.\n\nBuilding on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts [3_11]. Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.\n\nTo address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives [0_21]. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts [4_30].\n\n**Reference**\n[0_21] *A 2024 article*.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists\u2019 capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled \"The Impact of AI on Modern Art\"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.\n\nSecond, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.\n\nThird, let\u2019s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article \"AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the...\"*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.\n\nFourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled \"Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a...\"*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in \"AI's impact on art | News\"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.\n\nIn short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

        "statement": "Thank you chair person and a steam judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

        "statement": "Esteemed judges, we've shown today that AI will not cause the decline of human creative arts; instead, it will fundamentally transform them. The core debate is whether AI devalues human skill.\n\nFirst, while our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry, *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates that AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering [1]. This opens doors for new artists traditionally excluded due to technical or resource barriers. Second, regarding job displacement, we've demonstrated that AI empowers artists to focus on their core craft. According to *Adobe's 2023 study on the future of creativity*, artists are using AI to automate tedious tasks, freeing up their time to explore new creative avenues [2].\n\nTherefore, we maintain that AI amplifies human artistic capabilities. It's not about replacement; it's about expansion. AI democratizes art creation, and the fusion of human ingenuity with AI unlocks unprecedented creativity. As you've seen, AI allows a more diverse group to participate in artistic expression. *A 2024 report by Arts Council England* highlights that AI tools are enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in creative practices they previously couldn't access [3].\n\nFinally, regarding copyright concerns, remember that these issues are inherently adaptable. *A 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) report* suggests that the uncertainty surrounding AI and copyright is sparking creativity, challenging artists to find novel ways to collaborate with AI while protecting their intellectual property [4].\n\nIn closing, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity. It opens new chapters, offering new tools and opportunities for artists to thrive. Vote against the narrative of decline.",
