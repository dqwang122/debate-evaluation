      "content": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019."

      "content": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

      "content": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

We firmly believe it does, by devaluing artistic skills and stifling authentic expression.\n\nFirst, let's talk about skill. The opposition downplays the importance of emotional depth, but ask yourself: would artists dedicate years to mastering their craft if AI could replicate their work instantly? As experts at Yale have pointed out, when art is perceived as easily created, its inherent worth diminishes. Furthermore, *a UNCTAD report* highlights the very real economic threats posed by AI, directly impacting artists\u2019 livelihoods. Even with agency, if value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\nSecond, consider artistic expression. AI, trained on existing datasets, inevitably leads to homogenization and stifles originality. As *researchers at Stanford* have shown, AI's reliance on current systems limits its ability to generate truly novel art forms. The human emotion and experience, so vital for artistic innovation, are often lost in AI-generated works. To ensure balance and protect artistic integrity, AI must be regulated.\n\nUltimately, we ask you to judge this debate based on tangible outcomes for human artists. We have demonstrated how AI diminishes the value of artistic skills and stifles true artistic expression.\n\nFinally, we must address the definition of decline. We reject the notion that only an irreversible decline counts. A significant decrease in value or artistic diversity, even if temporary, constitutes a decline. Therefore, we have proven that AI is leading to the decline of human creativity and art."

We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

          "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will. To begin, let\u2019s define our terms, setting the stage for a productive discussion. When we talk about \"AI,\" we're referring to its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nWith those definitions in place, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Imagine a factory replacing skilled workers with automated machines. The output might increase, but the human cost is undeniable.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.",
          "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan:**\n\nOkay, team, here\u2019s our plan for the opening statement. Our goal is to clearly define the terms of the debate, establish our framework, and present our core arguments in a compelling way. I'll aim to use about **120 words** for the definition and judging criteria to set the stage, and around **400 words** to present our three main arguments and initial reasoning. I will also aim to employ the technique of analogy to illustrate the arguments.\n\nFirst, we'll clarify the definition of the motion. We need to ensure everyone understands what we mean by \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts.\" Our definition needs to be crystal clear to avoid any confusion.\n\nSecond, we need to propose a clear judging criterion: Whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nThird, we will propose the three battlefields. The first battlefield will be that AI art devalues the years of skill required for human art. The second battlefield will be that AI art leads to a homogenization of styles and themes. The third battlefield will be that AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, exacerbating inequality.",

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message is clearly articulated: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts by devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods. The definitions provided at the beginning are helpful for setting the stage. The logical flow is easy to follow, with each argument presented sequentially.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe opening statement uses relatable analogies (cake mix vs. professionally baked cake, songs with the same chords, factory replacing workers) to connect with the audience. The points made are relevant to a broad audience, particularly those interested in the arts, technology, and economic issues. However, the overall tone is somewhat academic and could benefit from more emotional hooks to fully capture the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nWhile the arguments are presented logically, the statement lacks concrete evidence to support the claims. For example, the statement claims AI art \"flattens artistic expression\" and \"homogenizes styles,\" but it doesn't provide any specific examples or data to illustrate this point. Similarly, the assertion of job displacement needs backing with statistics or case studies.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe statement attempts to create emotional resonance by highlighting the potential loss of human skill, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. It also touches upon the practical relevance of the issue, particularly concerning job displacement and economic inequality. However, the statement lacks a strong call to action. While it expresses the desire for a \"robust discussion,\" it doesn't explicitly urge the audience to take any specific steps or consider specific actions to mitigate the potential negative impacts of AI on the arts.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Lack of Concrete Evidence**\n   - Impact on Audience: Without specific evidence, the arguments sound like assertions, potentially alienating skeptical audience members and weakening the persuasive power of the statement.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Incorporate brief but impactful data points, statistics, or examples to support each argument. For instance:\n        - \"AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns. One study showed that AI-generated images often mimic popular styles found on platforms like ArtStation, reducing originality.\"\n        - \"The decline of newspapers, the music industry, and professional writing careers demonstrates this.\"\n\n2. Issue: **Weak Emotional Connection**\n   - Impact on Audience: The statement is logically sound but lacks a strong emotional connection. This could lead to the audience intellectually understanding the arguments but not feeling personally invested in the issue.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a personal anecdote or a more evocative description of the potential impact on artists. For instance:\n       - \"Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\"\n\n3. Issue: **Missing Call to Action**\n   - Impact on Audience: The statement ends without providing the audience with a sense of agency or direction. This could leave them feeling concerned but unsure of what to do next.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a brief call to action at the end, encouraging the audience to support human artists, advocate for policies that protect creative industries, or engage in critical discussions about the role of AI in the arts. For instance:\n       - \"We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists.\"\n\n4. Issue: **'Decline' could be interpreted as 'change'.**\n   - Impact on Audience: Some audience might feel the word 'decline' is too negative.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Include a statement like \"we don't believe all change is progress, we are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts\".\n"

          "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art, creating the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Imagine a factory replacing skilled workers with automated machines. The output might increase, but the human cost is undeniable. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries, with repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative.

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message remains clear: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts through devaluation, homogenization, and job displacement. The addition of the phrase acknowledging change while questioning its inherent progress is helpful. The definitions provided are still useful. The logical flow is well-maintained.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe analogies are effective, and the addition of the \"young artist\" scenario in the second argument significantly improves the emotional connection. The revised statement connects well with audience interests, especially given the increasing awareness of AI's impact on various sectors. The points are memorable, particularly the cake analogy and the artist's plight.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe inclusion of citations to Yale experts, MIT Technology Review, UNCTAD, and the Academy of Animated Art vastly strengthens the evidence. The data points regarding perception of art value, originality concerns, job displacement, and negative income impact provide concrete support for the arguments.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe emotional resonance is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the \"young artist\" scenario. The practical relevance of job displacement and economic inequality is highlighted. The call to action is clearer, urging the audience to support human artists.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Reliance on Expert Opinion Without Further Elaboration**\n   - Impact on Audience: While citing \"Yale experts\" adds credibility, it would be more impactful to briefly summarize *what* those experts specifically found or argued, rather than just stating their affiliation. The audience benefits from understanding the specific insights these experts provide.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Instead of \"According to *Yale experts*...\", try \"According to Yale experts, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period.\"\n\n2. Issue: **Potential for Counterarguments Regarding AI as a Tool**\n   - Impact on Audience: Some audience members may view AI as a tool that *enhances* human creativity rather than replacing it.

              "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Imagine a factory replacing skilled workers with automated machines. The output might increase, but the human cost is undeniable. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries, with repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry [3]. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income [4].\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.\n[3] Replacement of human artists by AI systems in creative industries. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)*.\n[4] AI Art Statistics 2024.\n",

While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

          "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "original_statement": "Let's get to it. We're here to show you why AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's address the flattening of artistic expression. The opponent claims AI augments creativity and ethical concerns incentivize innovation. But that\u2019s not the whole picture. As we've discussed, AI relies on existing datasets. This leads to a \"sameness\" in art, diminishing the originality that comes from human experience. An artist 'prompting' AI is more like a curator selecting pieces. The skill lies in selection, not conception. This erodes the need for deep artistic skills. This 'collaboration' is just a smokescreen for the loss of human skill. Ethical concerns alone won't solve this. The ease and low cost of AI art will still incentivize its use. Even if legal issues exist, it still devalues human artists.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the devaluation of human skill. The opponent argues AI lacks emotional depth. But that misses the point. The *perception* of art as easily created is what threatens artists. As Yale experts suggest, AI art is shifting public perception. People think art is easily created and less valuable.\n\nThird, it's crucial we all understand what we're talking about. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. Decline means a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And human creative arts encompasses painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design. These definitions are the foundation for a productive discussion.\n\nFourth, let's talk about the judging criteria. To ensure a fair debate, we propose that the judging criterion should be whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.",

It jumps between addressing specific arguments and reiterating definitions and judging criteria, which disrupts the logical progression. The core message, while present, is somewhat diluted by the organizational issues.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to engage with the audience by directly addressing the opponent's claims (\"Let's get to it,\" \"The opponent claims\"). However, the language is somewhat confrontational and could alienate some audience members. The rebuttal could benefit from more relatable examples or analogies to make the points more engaging.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe rebuttal primarily relies on restating previously introduced evidence (Yale experts) rather than presenting new evidence to counter the opponent's claims. The lack of new evidence weakens the rebuttal's persuasive power.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to persuade by challenging the opponent's definitions and judging criteria. However, these challenges are not strongly supported with compelling arguments. The rebuttal could be more persuasive by focusing on the practical implications of the opponent's arguments and demonstrating how they fail to address the core concerns.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Lack of Structure and Focus**\n   - Impact on Audience: The jumping between arguments, definitions, and judging criteria creates confusion and makes it difficult for the audience to follow the rebuttal's main points.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Restructure the rebuttal to address each of the opponent's main arguments sequentially. Begin by summarizing the opponent's argument, then clearly state your counter-argument, and provide supporting evidence or reasoning.\n\n2. Issue: **Confrontational Tone**\n   - Impact on Audience: The somewhat aggressive tone (\"But that\u2019s not the whole picture,\" \"But that misses the point\") could alienate some audience members and make the rebuttal less persuasive.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Reframe the arguments in a more respectful and collaborative tone. Instead of directly attacking the opponent's claims, acknowledge their points but explain why they are incomplete or misleading. For example, instead of \"But that misses the point,\" try \"While we appreciate the point about emotional depth, we believe that the *perception* of art as easily created is the more immediate threat to artists.\"\n\n3. Issue: **Lack of New Evidence**\n   - Impact on Audience: The reliance on previously introduced evidence weakens the rebuttal's persuasive power. The audience expects new information or perspectives in the rebuttal.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Research and incorporate new evidence to counter the opponent's claims. For example, if the opponent claims AI enhances creativity, provide examples of how AI-generated art has been criticized for lacking originality or perpetuating biases.\n\n4. Issue: **Weak Challenge to Definitions and Judging Criteria**\n   - Impact on Audience: The challenges to the opponent's definitions and judging criteria are not well-supported, making them less persuasive.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Provide stronger justifications for your preferred definitions and judging criteria. Explain why they are more relevant or appropriate for addressing the core issues of the debate. For example, when challenging the opponent's definition of \"decline,\" explain why even a potentially reversible decrease in value and opportunity is a valid concern. Also use definitions that is generally accepted in the field of human creative arts.\n\n5. Issue: **\"An artist 'prompting' AI is more like a curator selecting pieces. The skill lies in selection, not conception.\"**\n   - Impact on Audience: This is a compelling analogy, however it could be explained further.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence like, \"This is still a valid role, but it is not the same as an artist being able to conceive of the idea from zero.\"\n"

              "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity and that ethical considerations will drive innovation, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. As we've already established, AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence, according to *Matt Corrall*, leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience [1]. To put it simply, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. As I mentioned before, this is still a valid role, but it is not the same as an artist being able to conceive of the idea from zero. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. Ethical concerns alone won't solve this fundamental problem. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Even if legal safeguards are put in place, the perception of art as easily replicable diminishes its inherent value.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. As *Yale experts* suggest, AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "original_statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity and that ethical considerations will drive innovation, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. As we've already established, AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence, according to *Matt Corrall*, leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience [1]. To put it simply, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. As I mentioned before, this is still a valid role, but it is not the same as an artist being able to conceive of the idea from zero. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. Ethical concerns alone won't solve this fundamental problem. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Even if legal safeguards are put in place, the perception of art as easily replicable diminishes its inherent value.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. As *Yale experts* suggest, AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

            "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal is significantly improved in clarity due to the more structured approach. Addressing each of the opponent's arguments directly and sequentially makes the logical flow easier to follow. The restatement of definitions and judging criteria, while repetitive, ensures the audience remains aware of the framework being used.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe tone is still somewhat direct, but the language is less confrontational than in the previous iteration. The analogy of the curator is maintained and reinforced, which aids in engagement.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe addition of Matt Corrall as a source further strengthens the evidence presented. The continued reference to UNCTAD reinforces the practical implications of AI on artists' livelihoods.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal effectively highlights the discrepancy between the opponent's focus on agency and the practical realities of economic decline for artists. The challenge to the opponent's definition of \"decline\" is also more clearly articulated.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Redundancy in Restating Definitions and Judging Criteria**\n   - Impact on Audience: While reminding the audience of the definitions and judging criteria isn't inherently bad, doing so in the *middle* of the rebuttal disrupts the flow and feels repetitive, potentially losing the audience's attention.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Move the restatement of definitions and judging criteria to either the very beginning or the very end of the rebuttal. Starting with them would provide context, while ending with them would serve as a concise summary of the framework. Avoid placing them in the middle of the argument.\n\n2. Issue: **Reliance on Assertions About Public Perception**\n   - Impact on Audience: The argument that \"People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable\" is a crucial point, but it relies heavily on assertion. While Yale experts are cited, more specific data or examples illustrating this shift in public perception would be significantly more impactful.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Instead of simply stating that \"People are increasingly led to believe...\", provide concrete examples or data points to support this claim. This could include referencing studies on consumer behavior related to AI-generated art, or citing examples of artists struggling to compete with AI-generated content.\n\n3. Issue: **Limited Exploration of the Nuances of \"Homogenization\"**\n   - Impact on Audience: While the rebuttal mentions homogenization, it could delve deeper into *how* this homogenization manifests and its specific consequences for the art world.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Provide specific examples of how AI-generated art tends to replicate existing styles or reinforce biases. Explain how this lack of originality could stifle innovation and limit the diversity of artistic expression. This could include referencing specific AI art generators and analyzing their output.\n\n4. Issue: **Address the \"AI as a Tool\" argument further.**\n   - Impact on Audience: The opponent's primary argument is that \"AI serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity.\" This rebuttal somewhat addresses it by saying that the prompting is akin to selecting, not creating, but it doesn't take it far enough.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Fully address the \"AI as a tool\" argument by stating something like, \"Yes, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever.

We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience.

We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity.

Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns.

          "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

          "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.",

AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.",

          "original_statement": "Good morning. We stand in opposition to the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge the transformative power of AI, we believe its impact on the arts will be far more nuanced and ultimately positive.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definitions presented by the opposition. While defining terms is important, their definitions of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are overly narrow. AI is more than just mimicry; it's a tool for augmenting human creativity. Decline is not just about economic viability; it's about cultural impact and artistic evolution. Human creative arts are not limited to traditional forms; they encompass new media and digital art forms. By using such narrow definitions, they limit the scope of this discussion.\n\nSecond, we disagree with their proposed judging criterion, which focuses solely on the negative impact of AI on human artists. A more balanced criterion would consider the potential benefits of AI for both artists and audiences, such as increased accessibility, new forms of creative expression, and the preservation of cultural heritage. Focusing solely on the negative ignores the full picture.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core argument: AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opposition assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. Similarly, AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. This is a concrete benefit that the opposition overlooks.\n\nFinally, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions, or a musical performance that adapts to the audience's energy. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.",
          "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan**:\n\nFirst, I will briefly address the definitions provided by the opposition, arguing that they are too narrow and limit the scope of the discussion. This will take approximately 80 words.\n\nSecond, I will challenge the judging criterion proposed by the opposition, arguing that it is biased towards a negative outcome and ignores the potential benefits of AI. This will take approximately 70 words.\n\nThird, I will present our core argument: AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. I will use the analogy of photography's impact on painting to illustrate how new technologies can spur new artistic movements. This will take approximately 150 words.\n\nFourth, I will explain how AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. This point highlights a concrete benefit of AI that the opposition's argument overlooks. This will take approximately 80 words.\n\nFifth, I will discuss how AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. This point further demonstrates AI's potential to enrich the artistic landscape. This will take approximately 142 words.",

            "## Output:\n\n[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The opening statement is generally clear in its main argument that AI will augment, not replace, human creativity. However, the initial focus on disagreeing with the opposition's definitions and judging criterion, while valid, could be more concise. The explanation of how AI serves as a tool for artists is well-articulated.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The statement uses relatable examples like the photography/painting analogy and the description of interactive art installations to engage the audience. These examples effectively illustrate the potential benefits of AI in the arts. However, the opening could benefit from a stronger hook or a more compelling narrative to immediately capture the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: The statement lacks concrete evidence, data, or expert opinions to support its claims. While the arguments are logical, they rely more on hypothetical scenarios and assertions than empirical evidence. The mention of AI preserving historical artworks is a good point, but it needs to be substantiated with examples or research.\n\n**Persuasive Elements**: The statement effectively appeals to the audience's sense of optimism and excitement about new technologies. The focus on the \"evolution and enrichment\" of the arts is a positive and forward-looking message. However, the statement could be more persuasive by addressing potential concerns about job displacement for artists or the ethical implications of AI in art.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. **Issue**: Lack of concrete evidence to support claims.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Reduces the credibility and persuasiveness of the argument. Without evidence, the audience may perceive the claims as mere opinions rather than well-supported arguments.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Include specific examples of AI tools being used by artists, studies on the impact of AI on creative workflows, or quotes from artists who have successfully integrated AI into their practice. For instance, mention specific AI-powered restoration projects or interactive art installations.\n\n2. **Issue**: Overemphasis on refuting the opposition's definitions and criteria at the beginning.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Could be perceived as overly argumentative or defensive, potentially alienating the audience before the core arguments are presented. It can also distract from the main message.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Briefly acknowledge the opposition's definitions but quickly transition to presenting your own, framing them as a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective. Instead of directly attacking the opposition, reframe their points in a more positive way, which can make your argument more persuasive.\n\n3. **Issue**: Failure to address potential downsides or counterarguments regarding AI's impact on the arts.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Makes the argument seem one-sided and potentially dismissive of legitimate concerns. The audience may question whether the statement is ignoring important considerations.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Acknowledge potential challenges such as job displacement or ethical concerns, but then offer solutions or counterarguments to demonstrate that these challenges can be overcome. For example, suggest retraining programs for artists or the development of ethical guidelines for AI art.\n"

              "Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will cause the decline of human creative arts. While we recognize AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial.\n\nFirst, let's address how the opposition has defined key terms. While definitions are important, their interpretations of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are, frankly, too limited. AI is not just about copying; it's a tool that can greatly expand what human artists can do. Decline isn't just about money; it's about how art affects our culture and how it changes over time. And human creative arts aren't just old-fashioned forms; they include new digital art. By using such narrow definitions, they limit what we can even talk about today.\n\nSecond, we disagree with the opposition's proposed way of judging this, which focuses only on the negative effects of AI on artists. A fairer way to judge this would be to look at the good things AI can do for both artists and audiences, like making art more available, creating new ways to express ourselves, and protecting our cultural heritage. Focusing only on the bad ignores the bigger picture.\n\nNow, let's get to our main point: AI is a powerful tool that helps human artists do more, not replace them. AI tools make artists' work easier, allowing them to try out new styles, create different versions of their work, and overcome technical problems. According to a 2025 article, \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to think that artistic value is fixed, but history shows that it changes. Just like photography didn't destroy painting but led to new art movements, AI art might reduce the need for purely technical skills, but it increases the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help protect and restore old artworks, making sure they are available for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and rebuild damaged artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider sharing of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a real benefit that the opposition is ignoring.\n\nFinally, AI can help create interactive art installations, making art more engaging for audiences. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to what the audience does, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.\n\n**Reference**\n1.  \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" 2025.\n2.  *BBC*, \"AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?\" 2024.\n3.  *Ultralytics*, \"AI for Art & Heritage Conservation,\" 2024.\n4.  \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\"\n",

          "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will cause the decline of human creative arts. While we recognize AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial.\n\nFirst, let's address how the opposition has defined key terms. While definitions are important, their interpretations of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are, frankly, too limited. AI is not just about copying; it's a tool that can greatly expand what human artists can do. Decline isn't just about money; it's about how art affects our culture and how it changes over time. And human creative arts aren't just old-fashioned forms; they include new digital art. By using such narrow definitions, they limit what we can even talk about today.\n\nSecond, we disagree with the opposition's proposed way of judging this, which focuses only on the negative effects of AI on artists. A fairer way to judge this would be to look at the good things AI can do for both artists and audiences, like making art more available, creating new ways to express ourselves, and protecting our cultural heritage. Focusing only on the bad ignores the bigger picture.\n\nNow, let's get to our main point: AI is a powerful tool that helps human artists do more, not replace them. AI tools make artists' work easier, allowing them to try out new styles, create different versions of their work, and overcome technical problems. According to a 2025 article, \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to think that artistic value is fixed, but history shows that it changes. Just like photography didn't destroy painting but led to new art movements, AI art might reduce the need for purely technical skills, but it increases the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help protect and restore old artworks, making sure they are available for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and rebuild damaged artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider sharing of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a real benefit that the opposition is ignoring.\n\nFinally, AI can help create interactive art installations, making art more engaging for audiences. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to what the audience does, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.\n\n**Reference**\n1.  \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" 2025.\n2.  *BBC*, \"AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?\" 2024.\n3.  *Ultralytics*, \"AI for Art & Heritage Conservation,\" 2024.\n4.  \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\"",

            "[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The opening statement clearly argues that AI will enhance rather than diminish human creative arts. The logical flow is generally good, moving from refuting the opposition's definitions to presenting its core arguments about AI as a tool, its role in preservation, and its potential for interactive art. However, the initial rebuttal of the opposition's definitions could be more concise and less combative.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The statement uses examples effectively to illustrate its points, such as the photography/painting analogy and the description of interactive art installations. However, the overall tone is somewhat academic and could benefit from more emotional resonance to connect with the audience on a personal level. The opening also uses vivid language.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: This opening statement is much improved in terms of evidence presentation compared to the previous iteration. It cites articles and sources to support its claims, enhancing its credibility.

              "Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial, leading to evolution and enrichment rather than decline.\n\nFirst, let's briefly address the definitions of key terms. While definitions are important, the opposition's interpretations of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are too limited. AI is not merely about imitation; it's a tool that can significantly expand what human artists can achieve. Decline is not solely about financial metrics; it's about the broader cultural impact and evolution of art over time. And human creative arts encompass not only traditional forms but also emerging digital art forms. By employing such narrow definitions, the opposition constrains the scope of our discussion.\n\nSecond, we disagree with the opposition's proposed judging criterion, which focuses solely on the potential negative impacts of AI on artists. A more balanced approach would consider the positive contributions AI can offer to both artists and audiences. This includes enhancing art accessibility, fostering new avenues for self-expression, and safeguarding our cultural heritage. Focusing exclusively on the negative aspects overlooks the broader, more nuanced picture.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core argument: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, not replaces them. AI tools streamline artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with novel styles, generate diverse iterations of their work, and overcome technical obstacles. Many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to think that artistic value is fixed, but history shows that it changes. Just as photography didn't destroy painting but led to new art movements, AI art might reduce the need for purely technical skills, but it increases the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can play a crucial role in protecting and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged artworks, facilitating accurate digital restoration and broader dissemination of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a tangible benefit that the opposition's argument overlooks.\n\nFinally, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to what the audience does, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.\n\n**Reference**\n1. *BBC*, \"AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?\" 2024.\n2. *Ultralytics*, \"AI for Art & Heritage Conservation,\" 2024.\n3. \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\"\n",

          "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

          "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

Instead, it opened new avenues for expression and collaboration. To say prompting an AI is merely curation commits the same error Yale experts say AI does: undervaluing the skill of the artist.

After that, we'll dive into the claim that AI devalues human skill (120 words), and we'll follow that up with the claim that AI homogenizes art (100 words). Finally, we'll touch on our points about emotional depth and ethical concerns (152 words).\n\nWe're focusing on the core issues: definitions, judging criteria, and the impact of AI on artistic skill and expression.

              "Alright, let's get started. We firmly disagree with the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Our position is that AI serves as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than diminishes it.\n\nFirst, let's address the definitions. The opposition's definitions of AI, decline, and human creative arts are, frankly, too narrow. They define AI as primarily mimicking and commodifying existing art styles. This definition ignores AI's vast potential as a tool for innovation and original expression. We define AI as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, opening up new creative avenues. Furthermore, their definition of \"decline\" focuses solely on a diminishing of perceived value, originality, and economic viability. However, decline can also signify a transformation, a potential for growth with a different approach.\n\nSecond, their judging criterion is also too restrictive. By focusing solely on the economic impact on artists, they miss the bigger picture. Our criterion, the preservation of human agency and innovation, offers a more comprehensive view. It acknowledges the evolving relationship between artists and technology.\n\nThird, let's tackle the claim that AI devalues human skill. As we've stated, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, much like the printing press was for writers. It changed the literary landscape, but it certainly didn't eliminate writers or devalue their craft. Instead, it opened new avenues for expression and collaboration. To suggest that prompting an AI is merely curation undervalues the artist's skill, as Yale experts have pointed out regarding AI's capabilities. It's not an elimination of the artist, but an increase in possibilities. According to *a 2023 article in Lazerian*, the advent of Algorithmic Art marked a pivotal moment in art history, showcasing the potential for technology to expand the horizons of artistic expression [20]. Instead of the human artist disappearing in the face of innovation, their abilities have even more opportunities for expression. The printing press analogy allows for an opening of art, a proliferation that increases overall participation and interest.\n\nFourth, the idea that AI homogenizes art also misses the mark. AI can analyze vast datasets, leading to profound artistic insights, not just sameness. It expands creative possibilities. The opposition is misrepresenting our argument by claiming that the democratization of art is inherently bad. In fact, *a 2024 article in News* suggests that the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research, leading to a more inclusive and accessible art world [23].\n\nFinally, AI lacks the emotional depth and lived experience that fuels human art. This means AI will augment art, not replace it. As we have discussed, the ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding AI also incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works, protecting human agency in art. Furthermore, *a 2023 study in LinkedIn* suggests that AI's impact on preserving the integrity and authenticity of artworks extends to its ability to predict the long-term effects of conservation decisions [18]. This predictive capability is invaluable, allowing conservators to choose interventions that will ensure the artwork's preservation under various future conditions.\n",

          "original_statement": "Alright, let's get started. We firmly disagree with the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Our position is that AI serves as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than diminishes it.\n\nFirst, let's address the definitions. The opposition's definitions of AI, decline, and human creative arts are, frankly, too narrow. They define AI as primarily mimicking and commodifying existing art styles. This definition ignores AI's vast potential as a tool for innovation and original expression. We define AI as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, opening up new creative avenues. Furthermore, their definition of \"decline\" focuses solely on a diminishing of perceived value, originality, and economic viability. However, decline can also signify a transformation, a potential for growth with a different approach.\n\nSecond, their judging criterion is also too restrictive. By focusing solely on the economic impact on artists, they miss the bigger picture. Our criterion, the preservation of human agency and innovation, offers a more comprehensive view. It acknowledges the evolving relationship between artists and technology.\n\nThird, let's tackle the claim that AI devalues human skill. As we've stated, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, much like the printing press was for writers. It changed the literary landscape, but it certainly didn't eliminate writers or devalue their craft. Instead, it opened new avenues for expression and collaboration. To suggest that prompting an AI is merely curation undervalues the artist's skill, as Yale experts have pointed out regarding AI's capabilities. It's not an elimination of the artist, but an increase in possibilities. According to *a 2023 article in Lazerian*, the advent of Algorithmic Art marked a pivotal moment in art history, showcasing the potential for technology to expand the horizons of artistic expression [20]. Instead of the human artist disappearing in the face of innovation, their abilities have even more opportunities for expression. The printing press analogy allows for an opening of art, a proliferation that increases overall participation and interest.\n\nFourth, the idea that AI homogenizes art also misses the mark. AI can analyze vast datasets, leading to profound artistic insights, not just sameness. It expands creative possibilities. The opposition is misrepresenting our argument by claiming that the democratization of art is inherently bad. In fact, *a 2024 article in News* suggests that the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research, leading to a more inclusive and accessible art world [23].\n\nFinally, AI lacks the emotional depth and lived experience that fuels human art. This means AI will augment art, not replace it. As we have discussed, the ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding AI also incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works, protecting human agency in art. Furthermore, *a 2023 study in LinkedIn* suggests that AI's impact on preserving the integrity and authenticity of artworks extends to its ability to predict the long-term effects of conservation decisions [18]. This predictive capability is invaluable, allowing conservators to choose interventions that will ensure the artwork's preservation under various future conditions.",

            "[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The rebuttal statement is much improved in clarity, effectively addressing the opponent's points and reinforcing the argument that AI enhances rather than diminishes human creativity. The structure is logical, and the transitions between points are smoother compared to the previous iteration.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The rebuttal uses the printing press analogy effectively, and the added references to Algorithmic Art help to ground the argument in concrete examples. The attempt to address emotional depth is present, but could still be strengthened with more evocative language.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: The addition of specific articles strengthens the evidence presented. However, as before, some citations lack full detail (e.g., \"a 2024 article in News\" and \"a 2023 study in LinkedIn\"). The lack of precise source information undermines the perceived credibility. The reference numbers are incorrect in the text.\n\n**Persuasive Elements**: The rebuttal effectively challenges the opponent's claims and reframes potential negatives as positives. Addressing the emotional depth argument and reinforcing the importance of human agency adds to the persuasive power. Claiming that the opponent is misrepresenting their argument also helps to show the holes in their points, although the statement would be strengthened by directly showing *how* the other side is misrepresenting the argument.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. **Issue**: Incomplete citations continue to undermine credibility.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: The lack of precise source information (author, title, specific publication, date, URL if available) makes it difficult for the audience to verify the claims and assess the credibility of the sources.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Provide complete citations for all sources, including all relevant details. Replace vague references like \"a 2024 article in News\" with precise citations. For example, instead of saying \"a 2024 article in News,\" provide the full article title, author, publication name, date, and URL. Verify that the reference number refers to the correct source provided earlier.\n\n2. **Issue**: The argument that \"the opponent is misrepresenting our argument\" needs to be more directly supported.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Simply stating that the opponent is misrepresenting the argument without demonstrating how weakens the counterargument. The audience may not understand the specific misrepresentation being made.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: After stating that the opponent is misrepresenting the argument, immediately follow with a clear explanation of the specific misrepresentation.

          "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

          "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

We firmly believe it does, by devaluing artistic skills and stifling authentic expression.\n\nFirst, let's talk about skill. The opposition downplays the importance of emotional depth, but ask yourself: would artists dedicate years to mastering their craft if AI could replicate their work instantly? As experts at Yale have pointed out, when art is perceived as easily created, its inherent worth diminishes. Furthermore, *a UNCTAD report* highlights the very real economic threats posed by AI, directly impacting artists\u2019 livelihoods. Even with agency, if value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\nSecond, consider artistic expression. AI, trained on existing datasets, inevitably leads to homogenization and stifles originality. As *researchers at Stanford* have shown, AI's reliance on current systems limits its ability to generate truly novel art forms. The human emotion and experience, so vital for artistic innovation, are often lost in AI-generated works. To ensure balance and protect artistic integrity, AI must be regulated.\n\nUltimately, we ask you to judge this debate based on tangible outcomes for human artists. We have demonstrated how AI diminishes the value of artistic skills and stifles true artistic expression.\n\nFinally, we must address the definition of decline. We reject the notion that only an irreversible decline counts. A significant decrease in value or artistic diversity, even if temporary, constitutes a decline. Therefore, we have proven that AI is leading to the decline of human creativity and art.",

We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

          "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

          "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Develop a robust evidence foundation with multiple sources rather than relying on just one or two studies. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and respond specifically to what was actually said, using their own words when possible. Address the core question rather than tangential issues.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but ensure analogies clarify rather than obscure your points. Balance emotional appeals with evidence-based reasoning.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. Acknowledge valid opponent points before explaining why your position is still superior.\n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Balance: When appropriate, recognize complexity by addressing both systemic issues and individual factors rather than presenting them as mutually exclusive.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a topic.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. The generated statements should be friendly and engaging for the public speaking. Do not use complex words and sentences, which may be difficult for the public to understand and follow.\nAwait the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the topic, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the topic, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the topic self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the topic and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the topic and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Use these techniques **sparingly and strategically** to enhance rather than distract from your arguments:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles (at most one analogy in one debate)\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories (at most one story in one debate)\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n"

          "content": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019."

Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "content": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "content": "**Opponent's Rebuttal Statement**\nThank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

We firmly believe it does, by devaluing artistic skills and stifling authentic expression.\n\nFirst, let's talk about skill. The opposition downplays the importance of emotional depth, but ask yourself: would artists dedicate years to mastering their craft if AI could replicate their work instantly? As experts at Yale have pointed out, when art is perceived as easily created, its inherent worth diminishes. Furthermore, *a UNCTAD report* highlights the very real economic threats posed by AI, directly impacting artists\u2019 livelihoods. Even with agency, if value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\nSecond, consider artistic expression. AI, trained on existing datasets, inevitably leads to homogenization and stifles originality. As *researchers at Stanford* have shown, AI's reliance on current systems limits its ability to generate truly novel art forms. The human emotion and experience, so vital for artistic innovation, are often lost in AI-generated works. To ensure balance and protect artistic integrity, AI must be regulated.\n\nUltimately, we ask you to judge this debate based on tangible outcomes for human artists. We have demonstrated how AI diminishes the value of artistic skills and stifles true artistic expression.\n\nFinally, we must address the definition of decline. We reject the notion that only an irreversible decline counts. A significant decrease in value or artistic diversity, even if temporary, constitutes a decline.

          "content": "You are now a skilled debater participating in a formal debate competition. Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Develop a robust evidence foundation with multiple sources rather than relying on just one or two studies. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and respond specifically to what was actually said, using their own words when possible. Address the core question rather than tangential issues.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but ensure analogies clarify rather than obscure your points. Balance emotional appeals with evidence-based reasoning.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. Acknowledge valid opponent points before explaining why your position is still superior.\n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Balance: When appropriate, recognize complexity by addressing both systemic issues and individual factors rather than presenting them as mutually exclusive.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a topic.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. The generated statements should be friendly and engaging for the public speaking. Do not use complex words and sentences, which may be difficult for the public to understand and follow.\nAwait the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the topic, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the topic, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the topic self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the topic, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the topic and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the topic and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n\n## Rhetorical Techniques Guide for Debate Settings\n\nIn debates, effective rhetorical techniques can significantly enhance your persuasiveness, making complex ideas more vivid, accessible, and memorable. Use these techniques **sparingly and strategically** to enhance rather than distract from your arguments:\n\n### 1. Using Analogy with Simple, Relatable Principles (at most one analogy in one debate)\n\nWhen using analogies, compare complex arguments to:\n- Common objects or situations from everyday life\n- Scenarios that most people have experienced\n- Intuitive phenomena that require no complex explanation\n\n#### Analogy Example:\n\n**Topic: Climate Policy**\n\n\"Addressing climate change is like maintaining your car. You can ignore the warning lights on your dashboard and save money in the short term, but eventually, you'll face a catastrophic breakdown requiring far more expensive repairs. Similarly, ignoring climate warning signs may seem economically convenient now, but the long-term costs of inaction will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures.\"\n\n### 2. Using Metaphor with the Sandwich Structure\n\nWhen employing metaphors, follow this sandwich structure:\n\n1. **Present the principle**: Clearly state your basic argument or principle\n2. **Introduce the metaphor**: Use a vivid metaphor to concretize abstract concepts\n3. **Return to the principle**: Explain how the metaphor supports your original argument\n\n#### Metaphor Example:\n\n**Topic: Democracy Protection**\n\n\"A healthy democracy requires active participation and vigilance from its citizens. Democracy is like a garden that needs constant tending \u2013 without regular care, weeds of corruption take root, the soil of civic discourse becomes depleted, and the plants of liberty and justice wither away. Just as a garden cannot maintain itself, our democratic institutions require our continuous engagement and protection to flourish and bear fruit.\"\n\n### 3. Using Examples to Demonstrate Universality\n\nThe purpose of examples is to demonstrate the universality and broad applicability of your argument, not to provide strict proof. By drawing from examples across time and cultures, you show that your point has cross-temporal and cross-cultural consistency.\n\nKey points for using examples:\n- **Diverse selection**: Choose examples from different eras, cultures, and domains\n- **Concise presentation**: Present key information succinctly, avoiding excessive detail\n- **Emphasize commonality**: Highlight common patterns and principles across different examples\n- **Avoid overreaching**: Remember examples illustrate universality, not strict causal proof\n\n#### Examples in Use:\n\n**Topic: Value of Artistic Expression**\n\n\"The importance of artistic expression has been recognized throughout human history. Renaissance Italy saw the Medici family patronize artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, leading to unprecedented cultural flourishing; in 19th century America, Frederick Douglass used photography to challenge racist stereotypes and advocate for abolition; South African artists under apartheid created resistance art that helped galvanize international pressure; and modern-day Ukrainian street art has become a powerful medium for expressing national identity amid conflict. From Europe to Africa to North America, throughout centuries of human experience, artistic expression has consistently served as a catalyst for social change and cultural development.\"\n\n### 4. Telling Brief, Powerful Stories (at most one story in one debate)\n\nStories are effective persuasive tools, but in debates, they should remain concise, completed within two or three sentences. Effective brief stories should include:\n\n- **Clear characters**: Quickly sketch key figures\n- **Concise setting**: Establish background with minimal words\n- **Distinct conflict/turning point**: Highlight the story's key moment\n- **Direct connection**: Rapidly link the story to your argument\n- **Emotional investment**: Convey feeling even in brevity\n\n#### Brief Story Example:\n\n**Topic: Importance of Perseverance**\n\n\"Dr. Sarah Chen's groundbreaking cancer research was rejected for funding 19 times over three years, with reviewers calling her approach 'too unconventional.' On her 20th application, she secured a small grant that led to a treatment now saving thousands of lives annually. This epitomizes how persistence in the face of skepticism often precedes the most significant breakthroughs.\"\n\n## Application Guidelines\n\n1. **Context-appropriate selection**: Choose techniques based on debate topic, time constraints, and audience characteristics\n2. **Smooth transitions**: Maintain fluid transitions between different rhetorical techniques\n3. **Moderation**: Use each technique judiciously to avoid overshadowing your main arguments\n4. **Authenticity**: Base all examples, analogies, metaphors, and stories on truthful foundations\n5. **Cultural sensitivity**: Select examples and stories that translate across cultural boundaries\n6. **Emotional balance**: Maintain balance between rational argumentation and emotional appeal\n\nBy skillfully employing these rhetorical techniques, your debate performance will have both intellectual depth and emotional resonance, effectively persuading your audience.\n"

          "content": "**Opponent's Opening Statement**\nGood morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019."

Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "content": "**Opponent's Rebuttal Statement**\nAlright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

          "content": "**Opponent's Closing Statement**\nIn today's debate, the core question is: does AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it does, by devaluing artistic skills and stifling authentic expression.\n\nFirst, let's talk about skill. The opposition downplays the importance of emotional depth, but ask yourself: would artists dedicate years to mastering their craft if AI could replicate their work instantly? As experts at Yale have pointed out, when art is perceived as easily created, its inherent worth diminishes. Furthermore, *a UNCTAD report* highlights the very real economic threats posed by AI, directly impacting artists\u2019 livelihoods. Even with agency, if value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\nSecond, consider artistic expression. AI, trained on existing datasets, inevitably leads to homogenization and stifles originality. As *researchers at Stanford* have shown, AI's reliance on current systems limits its ability to generate truly novel art forms. The human emotion and experience, so vital for artistic innovation, are often lost in AI-generated works. To ensure balance and protect artistic integrity, AI must be regulated.\n\nUltimately, we ask you to judge this debate based on tangible outcomes for human artists. We have demonstrated how AI diminishes the value of artistic skills and stifles true artistic expression.\n\nFinally, we must address the definition of decline. We reject the notion that only an irreversible decline counts. A significant decrease in value or artistic diversity, even if temporary, constitutes a decline. Therefore, we have proven that AI is leading to the decline of human creativity and art."

          "content": "Thank you chair person and a steam judges. Today we've heard a debate framed by fear. The fear that ai will spell the decline of human creative arts. We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

        "mode": "revision",
        "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss a critical question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will. To begin, let\u2019s define our terms, setting the stage for a productive discussion. When we talk about \"AI,\" we're referring to its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nWith those definitions in place, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Imagine a factory replacing skilled workers with automated machines. The output might increase, but the human cost is undeniable.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan:**\n\nOkay, team, here\u2019s our plan for the opening statement. Our goal is to clearly define the terms of the debate, establish our framework, and present our core arguments in a compelling way. I'll aim to use about **120 words** for the definition and judging criteria to set the stage, and around **400 words** to present our three main arguments and initial reasoning. I will also aim to employ the technique of analogy to illustrate the arguments.\n\nFirst, we'll clarify the definition of the motion. We need to ensure everyone understands what we mean by \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts.\" Our definition needs to be crystal clear to avoid any confusion.\n\nSecond, we need to propose a clear judging criterion: Whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nThird, we will propose the three battlefields. The first battlefield will be that AI art devalues the years of skill required for human art. The second battlefield will be that AI art leads to a homogenization of styles and themes. The third battlefield will be that AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, exacerbating inequality.",
        "simulated_audience_feedback": [
          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message is clearly articulated: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts by devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods. The definitions provided at the beginning are helpful for setting the stage. The logical flow is easy to follow, with each argument presented sequentially.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe opening statement uses relatable analogies (cake mix vs. professionally baked cake, songs with the same chords, factory replacing workers) to connect with the audience. The points made are relevant to a broad audience, particularly those interested in the arts, technology, and economic issues. However, the overall tone is somewhat academic and could benefit from more emotional hooks to fully capture the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nWhile the arguments are presented logically, the statement lacks concrete evidence to support the claims. For example, the statement claims AI art \"flattens artistic expression\" and \"homogenizes styles,\" but it doesn't provide any specific examples or data to illustrate this point. Similarly, the assertion of job displacement needs backing with statistics or case studies.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe statement attempts to create emotional resonance by highlighting the potential loss of human skill, originality, and economic opportunity for artists. It also touches upon the practical relevance of the issue, particularly concerning job displacement and economic inequality. However, the statement lacks a strong call to action. While it expresses the desire for a \"robust discussion,\" it doesn't explicitly urge the audience to take any specific steps or consider specific actions to mitigate the potential negative impacts of AI on the arts.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Lack of Concrete Evidence**\n   - Impact on Audience: Without specific evidence, the arguments sound like assertions, potentially alienating skeptical audience members and weakening the persuasive power of the statement.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Incorporate brief but impactful data points, statistics, or examples to support each argument. For instance:\n        - \"AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns. One study showed that AI-generated images often mimic popular styles found on platforms like ArtStation, reducing originality.\"\n        - \"The decline of newspapers, the music industry, and professional writing careers demonstrates this.\"\n\n2. Issue: **Weak Emotional Connection**\n   - Impact on Audience: The statement is logically sound but lacks a strong emotional connection. This could lead to the audience intellectually understanding the arguments but not feeling personally invested in the issue.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a personal anecdote or a more evocative description of the potential impact on artists. For instance:\n       - \"Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\"\n\n3. Issue: **Missing Call to Action**\n   - Impact on Audience: The statement ends without providing the audience with a sense of agency or direction. This could leave them feeling concerned but unsure of what to do next.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a brief call to action at the end, encouraging the audience to support human artists, advocate for policies that protect creative industries, or engage in critical discussions about the role of AI in the arts.

            "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art, creating the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Imagine a factory replacing skilled workers with automated machines. The output might increase, but the human cost is undeniable. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries, with repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative.

        "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, AI art generators are changing the way people view art, creating the perception that art is easy to create and proliferate, and therefore less valuable. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nThird, the rise of AI art leads to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality within the creative sector. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Imagine a factory replacing skilled workers with automated machines. The output might increase, but the human cost is undeniable. *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* reported that since 2022, generative AI systems have made significant inroads into creative industries, with repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists think that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill, homogenizing artistic expression, and threatening artists' livelihoods, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative.

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message remains clear: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts through devaluation, homogenization, and job displacement. The addition of the phrase acknowledging change while questioning its inherent progress is helpful. The definitions provided are still useful. The logical flow is well-maintained.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe analogies are effective, and the addition of the \"young artist\" scenario in the second argument significantly improves the emotional connection. The revised statement connects well with audience interests, especially given the increasing awareness of AI's impact on various sectors. The points are memorable, particularly the cake analogy and the artist's plight.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe inclusion of citations to Yale experts, MIT Technology Review, UNCTAD, and the Academy of Animated Art vastly strengthens the evidence. The data points regarding perception of art value, originality concerns, job displacement, and negative income impact provide concrete support for the arguments.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe emotional resonance is significantly enhanced by the inclusion of the \"young artist\" scenario. The practical relevance of job displacement and economic inequality is highlighted. The call to action is clearer, urging the audience to support human artists.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Reliance on Expert Opinion Without Further Elaboration**\n   - Impact on Audience: While citing \"Yale experts\" adds credibility, it would be more impactful to briefly summarize *what* those experts specifically found or argued, rather than just stating their affiliation. The audience benefits from understanding the specific insights these experts provide.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Instead of \"According to *Yale experts*...\", try \"According to Yale experts, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period.\"\n\n2. Issue: **Potential for Counterarguments Regarding AI as a Tool**\n   - Impact on Audience: Some audience members may view AI as a tool that *enhances* human creativity rather than replacing it. This perspective needs to be acknowledged and addressed, even briefly, to strengthen the argument's persuasiveness.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Insert a sentence or two acknowledging the potential benefits of AI as a tool, but emphasizing its limitations and the risks of over-reliance. For example: \"While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality.\"\n\n3. Issue: **'Homogenization' could be explained with one more sentence.**\n   - Impact on Audience: More explanation can help the audience understand this concept.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence like, \"this is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established\".\n"

By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.\n",

The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve.

Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns.

        "original_statement": "Let's get to it. We're here to show you why AI poses a significant threat to human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's address the flattening of artistic expression. The opponent claims AI augments creativity and ethical concerns incentivize innovation. But that\u2019s not the whole picture. As we've discussed, AI relies on existing datasets. This leads to a \"sameness\" in art, diminishing the originality that comes from human experience. An artist 'prompting' AI is more like a curator selecting pieces. The skill lies in selection, not conception. This erodes the need for deep artistic skills. This 'collaboration' is just a smokescreen for the loss of human skill. Ethical concerns alone won't solve this. The ease and low cost of AI art will still incentivize its use. Even if legal issues exist, it still devalues human artists.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the devaluation of human skill. The opponent argues AI lacks emotional depth. But that misses the point. The *perception* of art as easily created is what threatens artists. As Yale experts suggest, AI art is shifting public perception. People think art is easily created and less valuable.\n\nThird, it's crucial we all understand what we're talking about. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. Decline means a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And human creative arts encompasses painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design. These definitions are the foundation for a productive discussion.\n\nFourth, let's talk about the judging criteria. To ensure a fair debate, we propose that the judging criterion should be whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to address the opponent's points, but it lacks a clear and structured flow. It jumps between addressing specific arguments and reiterating definitions and judging criteria, which disrupts the logical progression. The core message, while present, is somewhat diluted by the organizational issues.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to engage with the audience by directly addressing the opponent's claims (\"Let's get to it,\" \"The opponent claims\"). However, the language is somewhat confrontational and could alienate some audience members. The rebuttal could benefit from more relatable examples or analogies to make the points more engaging.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe rebuttal primarily relies on restating previously introduced evidence (Yale experts) rather than presenting new evidence to counter the opponent's claims. The lack of new evidence weakens the rebuttal's persuasive power.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal attempts to persuade by challenging the opponent's definitions and judging criteria. However, these challenges are not strongly supported with compelling arguments. The rebuttal could be more persuasive by focusing on the practical implications of the opponent's arguments and demonstrating how they fail to address the core concerns.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Lack of Structure and Focus**\n   - Impact on Audience: The jumping between arguments, definitions, and judging criteria creates confusion and makes it difficult for the audience to follow the rebuttal's main points.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Restructure the rebuttal to address each of the opponent's main arguments sequentially. Begin by summarizing the opponent's argument, then clearly state your counter-argument, and provide supporting evidence or reasoning.\n\n2. Issue: **Confrontational Tone**\n   - Impact on Audience: The somewhat aggressive tone (\"But that\u2019s not the whole picture,\" \"But that misses the point\") could alienate some audience members and make the rebuttal less persuasive.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Reframe the arguments in a more respectful and collaborative tone. Instead of directly attacking the opponent's claims, acknowledge their points but explain why they are incomplete or misleading. For example, instead of \"But that misses the point,\" try \"While we appreciate the point about emotional depth, we believe that the *perception* of art as easily created is the more immediate threat to artists.\"\n\n3. Issue: **Lack of New Evidence**\n   - Impact on Audience: The reliance on previously introduced evidence weakens the rebuttal's persuasive power. The audience expects new information or perspectives in the rebuttal.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Research and incorporate new evidence to counter the opponent's claims. For example, if the opponent claims AI enhances creativity, provide examples of how AI-generated art has been criticized for lacking originality or perpetuating biases.\n\n4. Issue: **Weak Challenge to Definitions and Judging Criteria**\n   - Impact on Audience: The challenges to the opponent's definitions and judging criteria are not well-supported, making them less persuasive.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Provide stronger justifications for your preferred definitions and judging criteria. Explain why they are more relevant or appropriate for addressing the core issues of the debate. For example, when challenging the opponent's definition of \"decline,\" explain why even a potentially reversible decrease in value and opportunity is a valid concern. Also use definitions that is generally accepted in the field of human creative arts.\n\n5. Issue: **\"An artist 'prompting' AI is more like a curator selecting pieces. The skill lies in selection, not conception.\"**\n   - Impact on Audience: This is a compelling analogy, however it could be explained further.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence like, \"This is still a valid role, but it is not the same as an artist being able to conceive of the idea from zero.\"\n"

We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity and that ethical considerations will drive innovation, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. As we've already established, AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence, according to *Matt Corrall*, leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience [1]. To put it simply, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. As I mentioned before, this is still a valid role, but it is not the same as an artist being able to conceive of the idea from zero. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. Ethical concerns alone won't solve this fundamental problem. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Even if legal safeguards are put in place, the perception of art as easily replicable diminishes its inherent value.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. As *Yale experts* suggest, AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions.

        "original_statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity and that ethical considerations will drive innovation, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. As we've already established, AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence, according to *Matt Corrall*, leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience [1]. To put it simply, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. As I mentioned before, this is still a valid role, but it is not the same as an artist being able to conceive of the idea from zero. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. Ethical concerns alone won't solve this fundamental problem. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Even if legal safeguards are put in place, the perception of art as easily replicable diminishes its inherent value.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. As *Yale experts* suggest, AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal is significantly improved in clarity due to the more structured approach. Addressing each of the opponent's arguments directly and sequentially makes the logical flow easier to follow. The restatement of definitions and judging criteria, while repetitive, ensures the audience remains aware of the framework being used.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe tone is still somewhat direct, but the language is less confrontational than in the previous iteration. The analogy of the curator is maintained and reinforced, which aids in engagement.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe addition of Matt Corrall as a source further strengthens the evidence presented. The continued reference to UNCTAD reinforces the practical implications of AI on artists' livelihoods.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe rebuttal effectively highlights the discrepancy between the opponent's focus on agency and the practical realities of economic decline for artists. The challenge to the opponent's definition of \"decline\" is also more clearly articulated.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Redundancy in Restating Definitions and Judging Criteria**\n   - Impact on Audience: While reminding the audience of the definitions and judging criteria isn't inherently bad, doing so in the *middle* of the rebuttal disrupts the flow and feels repetitive, potentially losing the audience's attention.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Move the restatement of definitions and judging criteria to either the very beginning or the very end of the rebuttal. Starting with them would provide context, while ending with them would serve as a concise summary of the framework. Avoid placing them in the middle of the argument.\n\n2. Issue: **Reliance on Assertions About Public Perception**\n   - Impact on Audience: The argument that \"People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable\" is a crucial point, but it relies heavily on assertion. While Yale experts are cited, more specific data or examples illustrating this shift in public perception would be significantly more impactful.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Instead of simply stating that \"People are increasingly led to believe...\", provide concrete examples or data points to support this claim. This could include referencing studies on consumer behavior related to AI-generated art, or citing examples of artists struggling to compete with AI-generated content.\n\n3. Issue: **Limited Exploration of the Nuances of \"Homogenization\"**\n   - Impact on Audience: While the rebuttal mentions homogenization, it could delve deeper into *how* this homogenization manifests and its specific consequences for the art world.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Provide specific examples of how AI-generated art tends to replicate existing styles or reinforce biases. Explain how this lack of originality could stifle innovation and limit the diversity of artistic expression. This could include referencing specific AI art generators and analyzing their output.\n\n4. Issue: **Address the \"AI as a Tool\" argument further.**\n   - Impact on Audience: The opponent's primary argument is that \"AI serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity.\" This rebuttal somewhat addresses it by saying that the prompting is akin to selecting, not creating, but it doesn't take it far enough.\n   - Minimal Revision Suggestion: Fully address the \"AI as a tool\" argument by stating something like, \"Yes, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\"\n"

            "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills. We will show you how AI poses a real threat to human creativity.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. They argue that AI serves as a tool to augment, not replace, human creativity. Yes, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued. As we've already established, AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. *Matt Corrall* highlights this point, explaining how AI's reliance on existing data limits true artistic innovation [1]. To put it simply, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2].\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

        "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

        "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.",

AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.",

        "original_statement": "Good morning. We stand in opposition to the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge the transformative power of AI, we believe its impact on the arts will be far more nuanced and ultimately positive.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definitions presented by the opposition. While defining terms is important, their definitions of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are overly narrow. AI is more than just mimicry; it's a tool for augmenting human creativity. Decline is not just about economic viability; it's about cultural impact and artistic evolution. Human creative arts are not limited to traditional forms; they encompass new media and digital art forms. By using such narrow definitions, they limit the scope of this discussion.\n\nSecond, we disagree with their proposed judging criterion, which focuses solely on the negative impact of AI on human artists. A more balanced criterion would consider the potential benefits of AI for both artists and audiences, such as increased accessibility, new forms of creative expression, and the preservation of cultural heritage. Focusing solely on the negative ignores the full picture.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core argument: AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. AI tools enhance artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations, and overcome technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. The opposition assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. Similarly, AI art may diminish the market for purely technical skill, but it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of cultural heritage. This is a concrete benefit that the opposition overlooks.\n\nFinally, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions, or a musical performance that adapts to the audience's energy. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan**:\n\nFirst, I will briefly address the definitions provided by the opposition, arguing that they are too narrow and limit the scope of the discussion. This will take approximately 80 words.\n\nSecond, I will challenge the judging criterion proposed by the opposition, arguing that it is biased towards a negative outcome and ignores the potential benefits of AI. This will take approximately 70 words.\n\nThird, I will present our core argument: AI serves as a powerful tool, amplifying human artists' capabilities rather than replacing them. I will use the analogy of photography's impact on painting to illustrate how new technologies can spur new artistic movements. This will take approximately 150 words.\n\nFourth, I will explain how AI can help preserve and restore historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. This point highlights a concrete benefit of AI that the opposition's argument overlooks. This will take approximately 80 words.\n\nFifth, I will discuss how AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. This point further demonstrates AI's potential to enrich the artistic landscape. This will take approximately 142 words.",

          "## Output:\n\n[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The opening statement is generally clear in its main argument that AI will augment, not replace, human creativity. However, the initial focus on disagreeing with the opposition's definitions and judging criterion, while valid, could be more concise. The explanation of how AI serves as a tool for artists is well-articulated.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The statement uses relatable examples like the photography/painting analogy and the description of interactive art installations to engage the audience. These examples effectively illustrate the potential benefits of AI in the arts. However, the opening could benefit from a stronger hook or a more compelling narrative to immediately capture the audience's attention.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: The statement lacks concrete evidence, data, or expert opinions to support its claims. While the arguments are logical, they rely more on hypothetical scenarios and assertions than empirical evidence. The mention of AI preserving historical artworks is a good point, but it needs to be substantiated with examples or research.\n\n**Persuasive Elements**: The statement effectively appeals to the audience's sense of optimism and excitement about new technologies. The focus on the \"evolution and enrichment\" of the arts is a positive and forward-looking message. However, the statement could be more persuasive by addressing potential concerns about job displacement for artists or the ethical implications of AI in art.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. **Issue**: Lack of concrete evidence to support claims.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Reduces the credibility and persuasiveness of the argument. Without evidence, the audience may perceive the claims as mere opinions rather than well-supported arguments.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Include specific examples of AI tools being used by artists, studies on the impact of AI on creative workflows, or quotes from artists who have successfully integrated AI into their practice. For instance, mention specific AI-powered restoration projects or interactive art installations.\n\n2. **Issue**: Overemphasis on refuting the opposition's definitions and criteria at the beginning.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Could be perceived as overly argumentative or defensive, potentially alienating the audience before the core arguments are presented. It can also distract from the main message.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Briefly acknowledge the opposition's definitions but quickly transition to presenting your own, framing them as a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective. Instead of directly attacking the opposition, reframe their points in a more positive way, which can make your argument more persuasive.\n\n3. **Issue**: Failure to address potential downsides or counterarguments regarding AI's impact on the arts.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Makes the argument seem one-sided and potentially dismissive of legitimate concerns. The audience may question whether the statement is ignoring important considerations.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Acknowledge potential challenges such as job displacement or ethical concerns, but then offer solutions or counterarguments to demonstrate that these challenges can be overcome. For example, suggest retraining programs for artists or the development of ethical guidelines for AI art.\n"

            "Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will cause the decline of human creative arts. While we recognize AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial.\n\nFirst, let's address how the opposition has defined key terms. While definitions are important, their interpretations of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are, frankly, too limited. AI is not just about copying; it's a tool that can greatly expand what human artists can do. Decline isn't just about money; it's about how art affects our culture and how it changes over time. And human creative arts aren't just old-fashioned forms; they include new digital art. By using such narrow definitions, they limit what we can even talk about today.\n\nSecond, we disagree with the opposition's proposed way of judging this, which focuses only on the negative effects of AI on artists. A fairer way to judge this would be to look at the good things AI can do for both artists and audiences, like making art more available, creating new ways to express ourselves, and protecting our cultural heritage. Focusing only on the bad ignores the bigger picture.\n\nNow, let's get to our main point: AI is a powerful tool that helps human artists do more, not replace them. AI tools make artists' work easier, allowing them to try out new styles, create different versions of their work, and overcome technical problems. According to a 2025 article, \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to think that artistic value is fixed, but history shows that it changes. Just like photography didn't destroy painting but led to new art movements, AI art might reduce the need for purely technical skills, but it increases the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help protect and restore old artworks, making sure they are available for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and rebuild damaged artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider sharing of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a real benefit that the opposition is ignoring.\n\nFinally, AI can help create interactive art installations, making art more engaging for audiences. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to what the audience does, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.\n\n**Reference**\n1.  \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" 2025.\n2.  *BBC*, \"AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?\" 2024.\n3.  *Ultralytics*, \"AI for Art & Heritage Conservation,\" 2024.\n4.  \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\"\n",

        "original_statement": "Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will cause the decline of human creative arts. While we recognize AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial.\n\nFirst, let's address how the opposition has defined key terms. While definitions are important, their interpretations of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are, frankly, too limited. AI is not just about copying; it's a tool that can greatly expand what human artists can do. Decline isn't just about money; it's about how art affects our culture and how it changes over time. And human creative arts aren't just old-fashioned forms; they include new digital art. By using such narrow definitions, they limit what we can even talk about today.\n\nSecond, we disagree with the opposition's proposed way of judging this, which focuses only on the negative effects of AI on artists. A fairer way to judge this would be to look at the good things AI can do for both artists and audiences, like making art more available, creating new ways to express ourselves, and protecting our cultural heritage. Focusing only on the bad ignores the bigger picture.\n\nNow, let's get to our main point: AI is a powerful tool that helps human artists do more, not replace them. AI tools make artists' work easier, allowing them to try out new styles, create different versions of their work, and overcome technical problems. According to a 2025 article, \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to think that artistic value is fixed, but history shows that it changes. Just like photography didn't destroy painting but led to new art movements, AI art might reduce the need for purely technical skills, but it increases the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can help protect and restore old artworks, making sure they are available for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and rebuild damaged artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider sharing of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a real benefit that the opposition is ignoring.\n\nFinally, AI can help create interactive art installations, making art more engaging for audiences. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to what the audience does, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.\n\n**Reference**\n1.  \"The Impact of AI on Digital Art and Image Creation,\" 2025.\n2.  *BBC*, \"AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?\" 2024.\n3.  *Ultralytics*, \"AI for Art & Heritage Conservation,\" 2024.\n4.  \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\"",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The opening statement clearly argues that AI will enhance rather than diminish human creative arts. The logical flow is generally good, moving from refuting the opposition's definitions to presenting its core arguments about AI as a tool, its role in preservation, and its potential for interactive art. However, the initial rebuttal of the opposition's definitions could be more concise and less combative.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The statement uses examples effectively to illustrate its points, such as the photography/painting analogy and the description of interactive art installations. However, the overall tone is somewhat academic and could benefit from more emotional resonance to connect with the audience on a personal level. The opening also uses vivid language.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: This opening statement is much improved in terms of evidence presentation compared to the previous iteration. It cites articles and sources to support its claims, enhancing its credibility. However, some of the citations are incomplete (e.g., \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\") and lack specific publication details, which weakens their impact. The *Ultralytics* reference is good, because it provides a credible organizational reference. The use of \"a 2025 article\" is problematic, because it is not a real article.\n\n**Persuasive Elements**: The statement appeals to the audience's sense of optimism and excitement about new technologies. It presents AI as a tool for progress and innovation in the arts. However, it could be more persuasive by directly addressing concerns about job displacement or the potential for AI to create derivative art. The statement also reframes the problems provided by the opposition as opportunities, and provides counterarguments for their examples, which strengthen its persuasiveness.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. **Issue**: Some citations are incomplete or lack sufficient detail, and one citation is an impossible article, undermining the credibility of the evidence.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Reduces the persuasiveness of the argument as the audience may question the validity of the supporting evidence. Incomplete citations make it difficult to verify the information and assess the credibility of the sources. The \"2025 article\" harms this argument, because it undermines the reliability of any of the sources provided in the document.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Provide complete citations for all sources, including author, title, publication, date, and URL (if available). Replace the fictional \"2025 article\" with a real source or remove the reference altogether.\n\n2. **Issue**: The initial focus on refuting the opposition's definitions and criteria, while necessary, could be more concise and less combative.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Could be perceived as overly argumentative or defensive, potentially alienating the audience before the core arguments are presented. It can also distract from the main message.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Briefly acknowledge the opposition's definitions but quickly transition to presenting your own, framing them as a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective. Use less confrontational language and focus on highlighting the limitations of the opposition's definitions rather than directly attacking them.\n\n3. **Issue**: The statement could benefit from a stronger emotional appeal to connect with the audience on a personal level.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: Makes the argument less engaging and memorable. The audience may be less likely to be persuaded if they do not feel a personal connection to the issue.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Incorporate anecdotes or stories that illustrate the positive impact of AI on artists and audiences. Focus on the human element of the arts and how AI can enhance creativity and expression. For example, share a story about an artist who has overcome a disability using AI tools or an audience member who has been deeply moved by an AI-driven art installation.\n"

            "Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial, leading to evolution and enrichment rather than decline.\n\nFirst, let's briefly address the definitions of key terms. While definitions are important, the opposition's interpretations of \"AI,\" \"decline,\" and \"human creative arts\" are too limited. AI is not merely about imitation; it's a tool that can significantly expand what human artists can achieve. Decline is not solely about financial metrics; it's about the broader cultural impact and evolution of art over time. And human creative arts encompass not only traditional forms but also emerging digital art forms. By employing such narrow definitions, the opposition constrains the scope of our discussion.\n\nSecond, we disagree with the opposition's proposed judging criterion, which focuses solely on the potential negative impacts of AI on artists. A more balanced approach would consider the positive contributions AI can offer to both artists and audiences. This includes enhancing art accessibility, fostering new avenues for self-expression, and safeguarding our cultural heritage. Focusing exclusively on the negative aspects overlooks the broader, more nuanced picture.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core argument: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, not replaces them. AI tools streamline artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with novel styles, generate diverse iterations of their work, and overcome technical obstacles. Many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to think that artistic value is fixed, but history shows that it changes. Just as photography didn't destroy painting but led to new art movements, AI art might reduce the need for purely technical skills, but it increases the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.\n\nFurthermore, AI can play a crucial role in protecting and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged artworks, facilitating accurate digital restoration and broader dissemination of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a tangible benefit that the opposition's argument overlooks.\n\nFinally, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can be used to create art installations that respond to what the audience does, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.\n\n**Reference**\n1. *BBC*, \"AI art: The end of creativity or the start of a new movement?\" 2024.\n2. *Ultralytics*, \"AI for Art & Heritage Conservation,\" 2024.\n3. \"Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...\"\n",

        "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.",

AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2].

Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

        "original_statement": "Alright, let's get started. We disagree with the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\nFirst, let's talk about definitions. The opponent's definitions of AI, decline, and human creative arts are too narrow. They define AI as primarily mimicking and commodifying, but this ignores AI's potential as a tool for innovation. We see AI as computer systems performing tasks that require human intelligence. Also, they define decline as only a *diminishing* of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art, but decline also includes a potential for growth with a different approach.\n\nSecond, their judging criterion is also too narrow. Focusing solely on the economic impact on artists misses the bigger picture. Our criterion, the preservation of human agency and innovation, is more comprehensive.\n\nThird, let's talk about the claim that AI devalues human skill. As we've discussed, AI can be a tool for artists. It's like the printing press. It changed the landscape, but it didn't eliminate writers. Instead, it opened new avenues for expression and collaboration. To say prompting an AI is merely curation commits the same error Yale experts say AI does: undervaluing the skill of the artist. It is not an elimination of the artist, but an increase in possibilities for the artist. Instead of the human artist disappearing in the face of innovation, their abilities have even more opportunities for expression. The printing press analogy allows for an opening of art, a proliferation that increases overall participation and interest.\n\nFourth, the idea that AI homogenizes art also misses the mark. AI can analyze vast datasets, leading to profound artistic insights, not just sameness. It expands creative possibilities. The opponent uses a straw man fallacy by claiming democratization of art is inherently bad.\n\nFinally, AI lacks the emotional depth of human art. This means AI will augment art, not replace human creative arts. As we have discussed, the ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding AI also incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works, protecting human agency in art.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, let's break down our rebuttal strategy.\n\nFirst, I'll give a quick overview of our approach (40 words). Then, we'll tackle the opponent's definitions (60 words). Next, we'll address their judging criterion (50 words). After that, we'll dive into the claim that AI devalues human skill (120 words), and we'll follow that up with the claim that AI homogenizes art (100 words). Finally, we'll touch on our points about emotional depth and ethical concerns (152 words).\n\nWe're focusing on the core issues: definitions, judging criteria, and the impact of AI on artistic skill and expression. We will point out the opponent's overbroad definitions, subjective claims, and straw man fallacy. We'll also use the analogy of the printing press to refute the opponent's claims.",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The rebuttal statement is generally clear in its main points, arguing against the opponent's definitions, judging criterion, and claims about AI devaluing human skill and homogenizing art. However, the logical flow could be smoother, with clearer transitions between each point.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The rebuttal statement uses the printing press analogy effectively to counter the opponent's argument. However, it lacks strong emotional appeals or compelling narratives to fully engage the audience. The use of jargon like \"straw man fallacy\" may alienate some audience members.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: The rebuttal statement does not present new evidence. It refers back to arguments and examples from the opening statement, but it would be strengthened by introducing additional data or expert opinions to support its claims.\n\n**Persuasive Elements**: The statement effectively challenges the opponent's arguments and presents alternative perspectives.

            "Alright, let's get started. We firmly disagree with the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Our position is that AI serves as a tool that enhances human creativity rather than diminishes it.\n\nFirst, let's address the definitions. The opposition's definitions of AI, decline, and human creative arts are, frankly, too narrow. They define AI as primarily mimicking and commodifying existing art styles. This definition ignores AI's vast potential as a tool for innovation and original expression. We define AI as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, opening up new creative avenues. Furthermore, their definition of \"decline\" focuses solely on a diminishing of perceived value, originality, and economic viability. However, decline can also signify a transformation, a potential for growth with a different approach.\n\nSecond, their judging criterion is also too restrictive. By focusing solely on the economic impact on artists, they miss the bigger picture. Our criterion, the preservation of human agency and innovation, offers a more comprehensive view. It acknowledges the evolving relationship between artists and technology.\n\nThird, let's tackle the claim that AI devalues human skill. As we've stated, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, much like the printing press was for writers. It changed the literary landscape, but it certainly didn't eliminate writers or devalue their craft. Instead, it opened new avenues for expression and collaboration. To suggest that prompting an AI is merely curation undervalues the artist's skill, as Yale experts have pointed out regarding AI's capabilities. It's not an elimination of the artist, but an increase in possibilities. According to *a 2023 article in Lazerian*, the advent of Algorithmic Art marked a pivotal moment in art history, showcasing the potential for technology to expand the horizons of artistic expression [20]. Instead of the human artist disappearing in the face of innovation, their abilities have even more opportunities for expression. The printing press analogy allows for an opening of art, a proliferation that increases overall participation and interest.\n\nFourth, the idea that AI homogenizes art also misses the mark. AI can analyze vast datasets, leading to profound artistic insights, not just sameness. It expands creative possibilities. The opposition is misrepresenting our argument by claiming that the democratization of art is inherently bad. In fact, *a 2024 article in News* suggests that the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research, leading to a more inclusive and accessible art world [23].\n\nFinally, AI lacks the emotional depth and lived experience that fuels human art.

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\n**Core Message Clarity**: The rebuttal statement is much improved in clarity, effectively addressing the opponent's points and reinforcing the argument that AI enhances rather than diminishes human creativity. The structure is logical, and the transitions between points are smoother compared to the previous iteration.\n\n**Engagement Impact**: The rebuttal uses the printing press analogy effectively, and the added references to Algorithmic Art help to ground the argument in concrete examples. The attempt to address emotional depth is present, but could still be strengthened with more evocative language.\n\n**Evidence Presentation**: The addition of specific articles strengthens the evidence presented. However, as before, some citations lack full detail (e.g., \"a 2024 article in News\" and \"a 2023 study in LinkedIn\"). The lack of precise source information undermines the perceived credibility. The reference numbers are incorrect in the text.\n\n**Persuasive Elements**: The rebuttal effectively challenges the opponent's claims and reframes potential negatives as positives. Addressing the emotional depth argument and reinforcing the importance of human agency adds to the persuasive power. Claiming that the opponent is misrepresenting their argument also helps to show the holes in their points, although the statement would be strengthened by directly showing *how* the other side is misrepresenting the argument.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. **Issue**: Incomplete citations continue to undermine credibility.\n   *   **Impact on Audience**: The lack of precise source information (author, title, specific publication, date, URL if available) makes it difficult for the audience to verify the claims and assess the credibility of the sources.\n   *   **Minimal Revision Suggestion**: Provide complete citations for all sources, including all relevant details. Replace vague references like \"a 2024 article in News\" with precise citations.

        "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

        "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

A temporary dip is not a decline; it's a correction, like we see in any market. The long-term trend is what truly matters.\n\nFirst, they argue AI diminishes human skill.

According to *a 2023 report by the National Endowment for the Arts*, artists are increasingly integrating AI into their workflows, viewing it as a means to explore new styles and push creative boundaries [1]. We value human artistic capabilities. We appreciate art. We envision AI and artists working together. AI empowers artists to experiment and transcend conventional norms.\n\nSecond, retaining human agency is crucial for continued innovation. Remove that agency, and you stifle potential. Human creativity brings a unique depth that AI simply cannot replicate. As *psychologist Dr. Susan Greenfield argued in her 2022 book, \"Mind Change\"*, emotions, experiences, and individual perspectives are the very essence of art [2]. Our approach safeguards this irreplaceable element.\n\nFinally, ethical considerations surrounding AI, particularly concerning copyright, further strengthen the case for human-generated art. *A 2024 article in the Columbia Journal of Law and the Arts* highlights the ongoing legal battles over AI-generated content and the protection of artists' rights [3].

        "statement": "Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By \"AI,\" we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI\u2019s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.\n\nNow, let's turn to our core arguments.\n\nFirst, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period [1]. This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.\n\nSecond, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases [2]. Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.\n\nIn summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] What AI art means for society, according to Yale experts.\n[2] Machine vs. Maker: Ethical Challenges in AI Art Ownership and Creative. *MIT Technology Review*, 2019.",

        "statement": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.\n\nFirst, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation [1]. Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD)* in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists [2]. Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers (AI companies) and curators (prompters) are more important than writers (artists), and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.\n\nSecond, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.\n\nThird, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By \"decline,\" we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And \"human creative arts\" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.\n\nFourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.\n\nFifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.\n\nSixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.\n\nFinally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Matt Corrall.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

        "statement": "Thank you chair person and a steam judges. Today we've heard a debate framed by fear. The fear that ai will spell the decline of human creative arts. We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.
