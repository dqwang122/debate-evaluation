      "content": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue that, yes, a four-year college degree is still a good thing for young people these days.  We define \"pursuing a four-year college degree\" as attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree, acknowledging that various paths to success exist.  We're judging this based on how it affects young people's lives \u2013 their jobs, how they grow as people, and how they contribute to society. Basically, we believe education has lots of value in different ways.\n\nWe will present three key arguments: First, college education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Second, a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities and earning potential.  Third, a college degree promotes economic mobility and reduces income inequality.\n\nOkay, so, first things first.  College nurtures essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Picture this: you're at work, facing a really tough problem. Do you rely on gut instinct or a methodical approach? Research in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant cognitive growth during college [1]. This is not just some theory; this matters in real life. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) found that 82.9% of employers prioritize critical thinking in new hires [2].  Colleges give you the skills you need to do well in today's tough job world.  Studies in *Collegenp* and *Springer* further link improved critical thinking to better academic performance and psychological well-being, directly impacting real-world problem-solving and informed decision-making [3, 4]. And that, my friends, is super helpful for dealing with today's world.\n\nOkay, now for my second point.  Earning a bachelor's degree unlocks a wider array of career opportunities. Consider this:  Indeed.com advises that a bachelor's degree keeps more career doors open, especially for leadership positions or pursuing advanced degrees [5].  While the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data highlights various successful career paths without a four-year degree [6], a significant 30% of jobs still require a bachelor\u2019s or higher, leaving you with fewer options if you don't pursue higher education [7].  Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) reinforces that a bachelor\u2019s degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions [8]. The key thing is not just finding a job, but how much you earn.  The BLS further states that jobs requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree tend to offer higher median wages [7]. A college degree significantly enhances your earning potential and financial security.\n\nLet me turn to our final argument.  A college degree significantly impacts economic mobility and income inequality. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce demonstrates this in their report \"Learning and Earning by Degrees\" [9].  Their analysis projects a staggering $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers with college degrees over their lifetimes, based on Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data. This isn't just about individual gain.  This increased earning power fuels economic growth through higher spending and tax revenue, benefiting society as a whole.  While we acknowledge that education alone isn't a panacea for all economic challenges, the compelling data underscores the powerful role of a college degree in boosting individual earnings and contributing to broader economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-year college degree remains a powerful catalyst for positive change, equipping young adults with essential skills, expanding career horizons, and fostering economic growth.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huber, C.

      "content": "Hey everyone, we're here to argue that a four-year degree isn't always the best path for young people today. Our opponents focus on the good stuff, but they miss some big problems with degrees these days. We agree with their definition of pursuing a four-year college degree, meaning attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree.  However, we disagree with their judging criteria. Instead of focusing solely on individual growth and societal contributions, we contend that the true measure of benefit lies in the overall value proposition. It's about seeing if the time and money you spend actually pays off in today's job market. This way, we can see the whole picture better.\n\nWe will present three key counterarguments. First, the cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates. Second, online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives. Third, many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\n\nSo, first, let's talk money. College can be really expensive.  Studies in FREOPP reveal a troubling statistic: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment [1]. Think about it: one in four grads might be worse off after getting their degree.  This completely undermines the supposed financial advantages. And even when you do make money back, it often isn't much. The rising cost of tuition, as documented by College Values Online, exacerbates this issue [2].  For many young adults, the crushing weight of student loan debt can negate any potential financial gains for years, if not decades. This brings me to our second argument.\n\nLuckily, there are other great options besides a four-year degree. Online courses and certifications provide more affordable and flexible pathways to career advancement. Think of getting a great education for way less money.  As you'll see, Learn.org provides a clear cost comparison. Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions [3]. This affordability, coupled with the flexibility of online learning, makes these options a compelling alternative for today\u2019s young adults. They learn when they want, study what they need for their career, and skip the huge tuition bills.  This flexibility and affordability are critical in today's dynamic job market.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not just about affordability, but also changing notions of success. Our final argument challenges the outdated assumption that a four-year degree guarantees success. Countless individuals have achieved remarkable success without a traditional college education.  Think about tech giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as highlighted by Mashable [4]. They revolutionized the technology landscape after dropping out of college. Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, a fact detailed by Develop Good Habits [5]. These stories, and countless others, demonstrate that entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree in today's innovative economy.  They challenge the traditional narrative and offer a different perspective on success.\n\nIn conclusion, while a four-year degree may still hold value for some, it is no longer the only or even the best path to success for all. The high costs, the emergence of affordable alternatives, and the proven success of individuals without degrees all point to a changing landscape.  We urge you to consider these realities and reject the outdated notion that a four-year degree is essential for all young adults in today's society.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.  *Does College Pay Off?

      "content": "Look, they've got a point about college costs, but they're missing the big picture \u2013 the long-term payoff. They talk about successful dropouts, but that's not the whole story, right?  So, let's tackle their points one by one, okay?\n\nThey say a degree isn't worth the money, pointing to folks who didn't get a good return.  But, you know, studies show that's not typical. Studies from College Possible demonstrate that bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime\u2014a whopping $2.3 million more than high school graduates [1].  The San Francisco Fed adds that the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 [2].  So, while costs are real, the long-term financial benefits are clear.\n\nThey highlight online courses and certifications as affordable alternatives. Sure, online courses teach you stuff, but they don't give you the same solid education and recognition as a degree.  Imagine this: You're trying to get a job, right?  Who gets a closer look, the candidate with a recognized degree or one with various online certifications? A degree holds weight, opening doors to more opportunities.\n\nThey showcase successful dropouts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  These stories are inspiring, yeah, but they're not how things usually go. Data from the Social Security Administration shows a substantial earnings gap. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates [3]. These outliers shouldn\u2019t overshadow the statistically proven financial advantage of a degree.\n\nOkay, so, let's go back over what we've talked about.  We\u2019ve shown that a college education cultivates vital skills. Think about yourself facing a tough problem at work. A meta-analysis in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant gains in critical thinking during college [4].  These skills are crucial for navigating today's complex world. Furthermore, 82.9% of employers say they want this very skill in new hires [5]. This means your investment in education is an investment in your future career.\n\nWe've also shown that a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics states almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree [6].  This isn't just about numbers, it's about your future. With a degree, you are prepared for the workforce and its evolving demands.  This directly impacts your earning potential, as highlighted by Indeed.com, by opening up more high-level positions [7]. They also stated that without the proper credentials, opportunities are limited, especially higher management roles or those requiring advanced study. This higher earning potential contributes to economic stability and long-term financial security, making a degree a worthwhile investment.\n\nFinally, we've shown how a college degree enhances economic mobility.  The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, using robust Census and education data, projects trillions in added earnings for college graduates [8].  This fuels economic growth and benefits society.  They further emphasized education's essential role in social mobility, enhancing one's capacity to improve their economic circumstances. This reinforces the link between a college education and improved financial outcomes, contributing to a stronger economy overall.\n\nIn conclusion, while alternative paths exist, a four-year college degree offers significant advantages in terms of skills development, career prospects, and economic mobility. These long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs, making it a valuable investment for young adults in today\u2019s world.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] College Possible.

      "content": "They mention long-term gains, right? But, they totally forget how expensive a four-year degree is right now. They say degrees guarantee success, but let's be honest, that's just not how it works. Okay, so let's tackle their arguments directly.  They brush off successful dropouts, but those stories are real.  While they cite statistics about higher earnings for graduates, Praxis profiles 125 successful individuals without degrees, across many fields [1]. These aren't just exceptions; they're proof that success doesn't always need a degree. And this leads me to their main point on long-term value.\n\nThey highlight this $2.3 million lifetime earning thing, but honestly, that's missing a lot. Consider this: the FREOPP study reveals a stark reality \u2013 nearly a quarter of bachelor's degrees lead to a negative return on investment [2].  And it gets worse: a staggering 43% of both two-year and master's degrees fail to deliver any financial gain.  So, before you bank on that $2.3 million, remember the significant number of graduates struggling to even break even. The rosy picture they paint ignores these stark statistics.\n\nThey're all about critical thinking from college, but where's the proof it helps you get a job?  They cite studies showing cognitive growth during college, but what good is that if graduates can't find suitable jobs? Research indicates a stark reality: 52% of recent college graduates are underemployed [3]. This means their expensive degrees aren't translating into fulfilling careers. It\u2019s not just about learning to think critically; it's about being able to use those skills in a job that values them.  This brings me to their argument about online alternatives.\n\nThey say online courses aren't worth much, but employers are starting to think differently. They talk about prestige, but is a degree you're drowning in debt for really better than skills employers need?  Learn.org's data reveals that online credits cost significantly less \u2013 sometimes thousands less per credit \u2013 than traditional college, both public and private [4].  This financial advantage lets you invest in yourself without crippling debt.  Furthermore, platforms like Continents.us emphasize the benefits of flexible online learning.  You control your pace and focus on skills directly relevant to the job market, something traditional degrees often miss. And let\u2019s not forget: increasingly, employers prioritize skills over degrees, as Forbes highlights [5].  So, while a degree might look good on paper, demonstrable skills land you the job. This leads us back to the financial reality of college.\n\nThey say you'll earn back tuition by 40, but that ignores the huge problems of high costs and big loans. College Values Online data shows tuition has increased by a whopping 747.8% since 1963 [6]. That's astronomical! This financial strain is made worse by student loan debt, averaging over $37,000 per borrower [7].  This crushing debt burden can delay major life milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or even just saving for retirement.  It's a financial anchor that can weigh you down for decades, severely limiting your financial freedom and future prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge the shifting landscape of education and the job market. The increasing costs, the emergence of viable alternatives, and the proven success of non-graduates demonstrate that a four-year degree isn't essential for everyone.  We urge you to consider these points and reject the notion that college is the only path to success.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Praxis. *125 Successful People Who Didn\u2019t Graduate College*. https://discoverpraxis.com/blog/13067/125-successful-people-who-didnt-graduate-college\n[2] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. *Does College Pay Off?

College Possible, San Francisco Fed show it: a degree's a smart investment, better finances long-term [1, 2].

Sure, many paths to success, but these stories don't change facts: degrees boost earnings, cut joblessness [3].  Consider this: you're applying for a job. A degree gives you an edge, showcasing your commitment to learning and skill development.\n\nWe've shown degrees give you key skills, like thinking critically, stuff employers want.  Research shows: college boosts brainpower, helps your career, problem-solving [4, 5]. Imagine navigating today\u2019s complex challenges. These skills are invaluable, both professionally and personally.\n\nFinally, we've demonstrated the broader societal benefits of higher education. More educated workers mean better economy, less income inequality [6].  This isn't just about individual gain; it's about building a stronger, more prosperous society for everyone.\n\nA four-year degree is an investment \u2013 in yourself, your future, and our collective future.

Whether you are a student, educator, professional, or lifelong learner, developing critical thinking abilities can dramatically improve your problem-solving skills, decision-making processes, and intellectual independence. What is Critical Thinking? At its core, critical thinking refers to the ability to think clearly and rationally, understanding the logical connections between ideas. It involves analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing information to form judgments. Rather than accepting information at face value, critical thinkers delve deeper, questioning assumptions and assessing the evidence before drawing conclusions. Components of Critical Thinking Critical thinking is a multifaceted skill, which includes: Analysis: Breaking down complex information into smaller, more manageable parts. Evaluation: Judging the credibility of sources and the strength of arguments. Logical reasoning: Making decisions based on coherent and well-structured thought processes. Intellectual independence: Forming opinions based on careful examination rather than external influences. By understanding these components, you can build a strong foundation for developing critical thinking skills, applicable to all aspects of life. Importance of Critical Thinking in Daily Life Why is critical thinking important?

Beyond the widely analyzed role of academic motivation, this study focused on the added value of social problem-solving ability in student adjustment in the academic context. Analyses based on the responses obtained from 253 students (197 women and 56 men) indicated the significant role of social problem-solving ability in student adjustment, with a small additional amount (f__2\u2009=\u2009.09) 9% of variance in life satisfaction and medium additional amount (f__2\u2009=\u2009.17) 15% of variance in depressive symptoms, beyond academic motivation. In particular, negative problem orientation was an important predictor of depressive symptoms (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.41, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and life satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212\u2009.26, p\u2009<\u2009.001); however, positive problem orientation was only an important predictor of life satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.21, p\u2009<\u2009.01). This study also showed the predictive role of the value, expectancy, and affection components of motivation in student adjustment. Overall, the findings highlight the relevance of training in problem-solving orientation and motivational components to improve college ",

This rigorous study synthesized numerous research findings, providing strong evidence for the cognitive benefits of higher education.  Specifically, the study revealed that the typical college experience leads to substantial growth in critical thinking, regardless of specific curriculum design.  Additionally, NACE's 2021 study, surveying a large sample of employers, found that critical thinking is the most sought-after skill in recent graduates.  These findings together underscore that college fosters critical thinking, a vital skill for navigating an increasingly complex world and excelling in today's demanding job market.  While some argue that critical thinking can be learned outside of college, the structured environment and diverse learning opportunities within higher education offer a unique and effective pathway for this crucial skill development.",

June 4, 2019 The Economic Benefits of Educational Attainment Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Tom Lee The Economic Benefits of Educational Attainment Executive Summary Education is vital for a highly skilled and productive labor force. This study seeks to quantify the relationships between additional educational attainment and employment opportunities, wage rates, and aggregate economic growth. We find that increasing education attainment would have powerful positive effects on the economy. Specifically: In sum: Greater post-secondary educational attainment of all types would not just increase employment opportunities and wages in the labor market, but would also spur widespread and stronger economic growth. Introduction Post-secondary education has clear benefits for those looking for a job: College-educated workers, for example, face lower unemployment and obtain higher wages than their less-educated counterparts. Unfortunately, education levels are not rising to match the economy\u2019s demands. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has decreased from a high of 9.9 percent to about 3.8 percent.[1] Despite this overall improvement, the rise in U.S. education levels has not kept up with the rise in demand for highly skilled workers. This relative shortfall of skilled workers inhibits the ability of firms to meet demand, expand, and augment levels of productivity. For the state or national economy, the cascading effects of lower educational attainment translate into lower rates of aggregate growth. In this study, we quantify the economic benefits of increasing education levels. Specifically, the study measures how attaining various levels of post-secondary education beyond a high-school diploma can positively affect workers\u2019 chances of be",

It projects $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers over their lifetimes, based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data.  This influx of earnings fuels economic growth through increased spending and tax revenue. While acknowledging that educational attainment alone isn't a silver bullet for economic justice, the report's comprehensive data analysis from reputable sources showcases the significant role a college degree plays in boosting individual earnings and thereby contributing to broader economic growth.  This strengthens the argument that, while diverse paths to success exist, pursuing a four-year degree remains a valuable tool for enhancing economic mobility and ultimately reducing income inequality.  Some argue that the cost of college outweighs the benefits, but this ignores the long-term return on investment and the wider economic benefits generated by a more educated workforce.",

According to Learning and Earning by Degrees: Gains in College Degree Attainment Have Enriched the Nation and Every State, but Racial and Gender Inequality Persists, this rising tide of educational attainment will lead to $14.2 trillion in additional net earnings for workers over their lifetimes, bolstering the US economy through additional spending and tax revenue. Beyond the monetary gains associated with increased educational attainment, individuals with higher levels of education also have better health outcomes, a stronger resistance to authoritarianism, and higher rates of civic engagement, among other benefits. However, while all demographic groups experienced increases in college degree attainment, gaps in attainment and earnings persist between white adults and adults from marginalized racial/ethnic groups, undermining the capacity of education\u2014by itself\u2014to create an economically just world.

A meta-analysis confirmed significant gains in these areas during college (Huber & Kuncel, 2016).  This development is crucial, as 82.9% of employers prioritize critical thinking in new hires (NACE, 2021).  Furthermore, improved critical thinking is linked to better academic performance and psychological adjustment, impacting real-world problem-solving and decision-making (Collegenp, 2024; Springer, 2022). These combined benefits enhance career prospects and personal development.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: A bachelor's degree opens doors to a wider range of career opportunities.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_5', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Average Salary With vs. Without a College Degree | Indeed.com', 'url': 'https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/average-salary-with-college-degree-vs-without'}, {'id': '2_9', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': \"10 Growing Jobs That Pay Well and Don't Need a 4-Year Degree\", 'url': 'https://blog.dol.gov/2023/11/14/10-growing-jobs-that-dont-need-a-4-year-degree'}, {'id': '2_21', 'query': \"Jobs that require a bachelor's degree\", 'title': \"What Jobs Can You Get with a Bachelor's Degree? | SNHU\", 'url': 'https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/career/bachelors-degree-jobs'}, {'id': '2_24', 'query': \"Jobs that require a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Projected openings in occupations that require a college degree', 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2021/article/projected-openings-college-degree.htm'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Earning a bachelor's degree unlocks a wider array of career opportunities and higher earning potential.  Indeed.com advises that a bachelor's degree keeps more doors open, particularly for high-level roles or later pursuit of master's and doctoral degrees. BLS data from 2022 indicates about 70% of jobs required less than a four-year degree, emphasizing the substantial 30% requiring a bachelor's or higher. The SNHU acknowledges a bachelor's degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions. Furthermore, the BLS states most jobs requiring a bachelor's degree also offer higher median wages.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: A college degree enhances economic mobility and reduces income inequality.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_10', 'query': 'Does a college degree reduce income inequality?', 'title': 'Boosting college degrees decreases inequality, lowers poverty', 'url': 'https://www.upjohn.org/research-highlights/boosting-college-degrees-decreases-inequality-lowers-poverty'}, {'id': '5_29', 'query': 'Correlation between college degrees and economic advancement', 'title': 'The Economic Benefits of Educational Attainment - AAF', 'url': 'https://www.americanactionforum.org/project/economic-benefits-educational-attainment/'}, {'id': '5_43', 'query': 'College degrees and income inequality statistics', 'title': 'The College Wealth Divide: Education and Inequality in America, 1956 ...', 'url': 'https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2020/01/17/the-college-wealth-divide-education-and-inequality-in-america-1956-2016'}, {'id': '5_44', 'query': 'College degrees and income inequality statistics', 'title': 'Learning and Earning by Degrees: Gains in College Degree Attainment ...', 'url': 'https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/attainmentgains/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce report, \"Learning and Earning by Degrees,\" demonstrates the substantial positive economic impact of increased college degree attainment. It projects $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers over their lifetimes, based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data.  This influx of earnings fuels economic growth through increased spending and tax revenue. While acknowledging that educational attainment alone isn't a silver bullet for economic justice, the report's comprehensive data analysis from reputable sources showcases the significant role a college degree plays in boosting individual earnings and thereby contributing to broader economic growth.  This strengthens the argument that, while diverse paths to success exist, pursuing a four-year degree remains a valuable tool for enhancing economic mobility and ultimately reducing income inequality.  Some argue that the cost of college outweighs the benefits, but this ignores the long-term return on investment and the wider economic benefits generated by a more educated workforce.\n\n"

        "statements": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue that, yes, a four-year college degree is still a good thing for young people these days.  We define \"pursuing a four-year college degree\" as attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree, acknowledging that various paths to success exist.  We're judging this based on how it affects young people's lives \u2013 their jobs, how they grow as people, and how they contribute to society. Basically, we believe education has lots of value in different ways.\n\nWe will present three key arguments: First, college education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Second, a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities and earning potential.  Third, a college degree promotes economic mobility and reduces income inequality.\n\nOkay, so, first things first.  College nurtures essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Picture this: you're at work, facing a really tough problem. Do you rely on gut instinct or a methodical approach? Research in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant cognitive growth during college [1]. This is not just some theory; this matters in real life. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) found that 82.9% of employers prioritize critical thinking in new hires [2].  Colleges give you the skills you need to do well in today's tough job world.  Studies in *Collegenp* and *Springer* further link improved critical thinking to better academic performance and psychological well-being, directly impacting real-world problem-solving and informed decision-making [3, 4]. And that, my friends, is super helpful for dealing with today's world.\n\nOkay, now for my second point.  Earning a bachelor's degree unlocks a wider array of career opportunities. Consider this:  Indeed.com advises that a bachelor's degree keeps more career doors open, especially for leadership positions or pursuing advanced degrees [5].  While the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data highlights various successful career paths without a four-year degree [6], a significant 30% of jobs still require a bachelor\u2019s or higher, leaving you with fewer options if you don't pursue higher education [7].  Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) reinforces that a bachelor\u2019s degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions [8]. The key thing is not just finding a job, but how much you earn.  The BLS further states that jobs requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree tend to offer higher median wages [7]. A college degree significantly enhances your earning potential and financial security.\n\nLet me turn to our final argument.  A college degree significantly impacts economic mobility and income inequality. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce demonstrates this in their report \"Learning and Earning by Degrees\" [9].  Their analysis projects a staggering $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers with college degrees over their lifetimes, based on Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data. This isn't just about individual gain.  This increased earning power fuels economic growth through higher spending and tax revenue, benefiting society as a whole.  While we acknowledge that education alone isn't a panacea for all economic challenges, the compelling data underscores the powerful role of a college degree in boosting individual earnings and contributing to broader economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-year college degree remains a powerful catalyst for positive change, equipping young adults with essential skills, expanding career horizons, and fostering economic growth.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huber, C.

        "statements": "Hey everyone, we're here to argue that a four-year degree isn't always the best path for young people today. Our opponents focus on the good stuff, but they miss some big problems with degrees these days. We agree with their definition of pursuing a four-year college degree, meaning attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree.  However, we disagree with their judging criteria. Instead of focusing solely on individual growth and societal contributions, we contend that the true measure of benefit lies in the overall value proposition. It's about seeing if the time and money you spend actually pays off in today's job market. This way, we can see the whole picture better.\n\nWe will present three key counterarguments. First, the cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates. Second, online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives. Third, many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\n\nSo, first, let's talk money. College can be really expensive.  Studies in FREOPP reveal a troubling statistic: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment [1]. Think about it: one in four grads might be worse off after getting their degree.  This completely undermines the supposed financial advantages. And even when you do make money back, it often isn't much. The rising cost of tuition, as documented by College Values Online, exacerbates this issue [2].  For many young adults, the crushing weight of student loan debt can negate any potential financial gains for years, if not decades. This brings me to our second argument.\n\nLuckily, there are other great options besides a four-year degree. Online courses and certifications provide more affordable and flexible pathways to career advancement. Think of getting a great education for way less money.  As you'll see, Learn.org provides a clear cost comparison. Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions [3]. This affordability, coupled with the flexibility of online learning, makes these options a compelling alternative for today\u2019s young adults. They learn when they want, study what they need for their career, and skip the huge tuition bills.  This flexibility and affordability are critical in today's dynamic job market.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not just about affordability, but also changing notions of success. Our final argument challenges the outdated assumption that a four-year degree guarantees success. Countless individuals have achieved remarkable success without a traditional college education.  Think about tech giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as highlighted by Mashable [4]. They revolutionized the technology landscape after dropping out of college. Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, a fact detailed by Develop Good Habits [5]. These stories, and countless others, demonstrate that entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree in today's innovative economy.  They challenge the traditional narrative and offer a different perspective on success.\n\nIn conclusion, while a four-year degree may still hold value for some, it is no longer the only or even the best path to success for all. The high costs, the emergence of affordable alternatives, and the proven success of individuals without degrees all point to a changing landscape.  We urge you to consider these realities and reject the outdated notion that a four-year degree is essential for all young adults in today's society.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.  *Does College Pay Off?

The College Payoff also details how some workers can make more than their better-educated counterparts. Key Findings 1 A Bachelor\u2019s degree is worth $2.8 million on average over a lifetime. 2 Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn 31 percent more than those with an Associate\u2019s degree and 84 percent more than those with just a high school diploma. 3 Women who work full-time, full-year earn 25 percent less than men at similar education levels. 4 At the highest education level, Black/African American and Hispanic/Latino individuals earn close to a million dollars less than their white and Asian/Asian American counterparts over a lifetime. Infographic In a surprising number of cases, people with less educational attainment earn more than those with more. This graphic represents just how much earnings overlap there is, relative to workers with a Bachelor\u2019s degree. View the Infographic Resources A college degree pays off\u2013but by just how much? In The College Payoff, we examine just what a college degree is worth\u2013and what else besides a degree might influence an individual\u2019s potential earnings. This report examines lifetime earnings for all education levels and earnings by occupation, age, race/ethnicity and gender. The data are clear: a college degree is key to economic opportunity, conferring substantially higher earnings on those with credentials than those without.

The Social Security Administration (ssa.gov), a highly credible government source, conducted a comprehensive study on lifetime earnings and educational attainment, finding that men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. This robust finding, based on extensive data analysis, demonstrates the significant financial advantage conferred by a bachelor's degree. While some exceptional individuals achieve success without formal education, this does not negate the statistically proven higher earning potential for the majority of degree holders.

Average tuition and fees at ranked private universities was about $40,000, while ranked public universities cost nearly $23,000 for out-of-state students and $10,500 for in-state students. In turn, the average student loan debt continues to rise, currently clocking in at about $30,000 per borrower, according to U.S. News data.

Daly Download PDF (65 KB) FRBSF Economic Letter 2014-13 | May 5, 2014 Earning a four-year college degree remains a worthwhile investment for the average student. Data from U.S. workers show that the benefits of college in terms of higher earnings far outweigh the costs of a degree, measured as tuition plus wages lost while attending school. The average college graduate paying annual tuition of about $20,000 can recoup the costs of schooling by age 40. After that, the difference between earnings continues such that the average college graduate earns over $800,000 more than the average high school graduate by retirement age. Media accounts documenting the rising cost of a college education and relatively bleak job prospects for new college graduates have raised questions about whether a four-year college degree is still the right path for the average American. In this Economic Letter, we examine whether going to college remains a worthwhile investment. Using U.S. survey data, we compare annual labor earnings of college graduates with those of individuals with only a high school diploma. The data show college graduates outearn their high school counterparts as much as in past decades. Comparing the earnings benefits of college with the costs of attending a four-year program, we find that college is still worth it. This means that, for the average student, tuition costs for the majority of college education opportunities in the United States can be recouped by age 40, after which college graduates continue to earn a return on their investment in the form of higher lifetime wages.\u00a0 Earnings outcomes by educational attainment A common way to track the value of going to college is to estimate a college earnings premium, which is the amount college graduates earn relative to high school graduates. We measure earnings for each year as the annual labor income for the prior year, adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI-U), reported in 2011 dollars. The earnings ",

From 2011 to 2022, the percentage of people aged 25 and older with at least a bachelor's degree jumped from 30.5% to 37.7%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The value of earning a bachelor\u2019s degree stems from more than their popularity or demand among employers. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders could see more earning potential and job security over their lifetime than thos",

The BLS, a leading source of U.S. labor market data, reveals that nearly a third of all jobs require at least a bachelor's degree (2022 data). This widespread requirement, identified through the BLS's rigorous data collection methods and publicly available via their official website, underscores the significance of a bachelor's degree for accessing numerous professional fields.  Furthermore, Indeed.com, a highly reputable job search platform with extensive insights into employer preferences, affirms the bachelor's degree as crucial for unlocking leadership roles and advanced studies.  Addressing the counterargument about cost, the long-term financial benefits, including higher earning potential and lower unemployment rates as documented by the BLS and SSA, often outweigh the initial investment.

On an annual basis, median earnings for bachelor\u2019s degree holders are $40,500 or 86 percent higher than those whose highest degree is a high school diploma.4 The earnings gap between college graduates and those with less education continues to widen. In 2023, median income for recent graduates reached $60,000 a year for bachelor\u2019s degree holders aged 22\u201327. For high school graduates the same age, median earnings are $36,000 a year.5 Eighty-seven percent of bachelor\u2019s degree holders report financial wellbeing, 20 percentage points higher than groups with any other level of education.6 Recent college graduates also weathered the Great Recession far better than their peers with a high school diploma. Today, the jobless rate for bachelor\u2019s degree holders is less than 3 percent.7 And the incidence of poverty among bachelor\u2019s degree holders is 3.5 times lower than it is for those who hold high school degrees.8 A college education is expected to become even more valuable. Over the past decade, all net job growth has gone to workers with bachelor\u2019s degree or graduate degrees.9 Additional Benefits to Graduates Of course, a college education is about more than just securing a job and a steady income. Consider health and safety, prerequisites for leading a fulfilling life. Bachelor\u2019s degree hold",

According to Learning and Earning by Degrees: Gains in College Degree Attainment Have Enriched the Nation and Every State, but Racial and Gender Inequality Persists, this rising tide of educational attainment will lead to $14.2 trillion in additional net earnings for workers over their lifetimes, bolstering the US economy through additional spending and tax revenue. Beyond the monetary gains associated with increased educational attainment, individuals with higher levels of education also have better health outcomes, a stronger resistance to authoritarianism, and higher rates of civic engagement, among other benefits. However, while all demographic groups experienced increases in college degree attainment, gaps in attainment and earnings persist between white adults and adults from marginalized racial/ethnic groups, undermining the capacity of education\u2014by itself\u2014to create an economically just world.

It's no secret that college is expensive. Both private and public institutions ranked by U.S. News saw tuition increases for the 2022-2023 academic year, according to data submitted in an annual survey. Average tuition and fees at ranked private universities was about $40,000, while ranked public universities cost nearly $23,000 for out-of-state students and $10,500 for in-state students. In turn, the average student loan debt continues to rise, currently clocking in at about $30,000 per borrower, according to U.S. News data. Though students may encounter difficulties paying for it, college is a worthwhile investment when done wisely, experts say. In 2021, the median weekly wage for full-time workers age 25 and older who had at least a bachelor\u2019s degree was $1,334, compared to $809 for those with only a high school diploma and no college, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Daly Download PDF (65 KB) FRBSF Economic Letter 2014-13 | May 5, 2014 Earning a four-year college degree remains a worthwhile investment for the average student. Data from U.S. workers show that the benefits of college in terms of higher earnings far outweigh the costs of a degree, measured as tuition plus wages lost while attending school. The average college graduate paying annual tuition of about $20,000 can recoup the costs of schooling by age 40. After that, the difference between earnings continues such that the average college graduate earns over $800,000 more than the average high school graduate by retirement age. Media accounts documenting the rising cost of a college education and relatively bleak job prospects for new college graduates have raised questions about whether a four-year college degree is still the right path for the average American. In this Economic Letter, we examine whether going to college remains a worthwhile investment. Using U.S. survey data, we compare annual labor earnings of college graduates with those of individuals with only a high school diploma. The data show college graduates outearn their high school counterparts as much as in past decades. Comparing the earnings benefits of college with the costs of attending a four-year program, we find that college is still worth it. This means that, for the average student, tuition costs for the majority of college education opportunities in the United States can be recouped by age 40, after which college graduates continue to earn a return on their investment in the form of higher lifetime wages.\u00a0 Earnings outcomes by educational attainment A common way to track the value of going to college is to estimate a college earnings premium, which is the amount college graduates earn relative to high school graduates. We measure earnings for each year as the annual labor income for the prior year, adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI-U), reported in 2011 dollars. The earnings ",

This data, controlling for socio-demographic factors, demonstrates the degree's impact.  While student loan debt can be substantial, the significantly higher earning potential allows graduates to manage and ultimately overcome this debt, as supported by the large lifetime earnings gains.

Data from the Social Security Administration (ssa.gov) reveals a substantial earnings gap, with bachelor's degree holders earning $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. This data demonstrates the significant financial advantage of a degree, making alternative paths less secure.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Opponents' Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"The cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates.\", \"argument\": [\"23% of bachelor\\'s degrees offer a negative return on investment (FREOPP)\", \"Rising cost of tuition (College Values Online)\", \"Crushing weight of student loan debt can negate potential financial gains\", \"Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits (Learn.org)\", \"Flexibility of online learning\", \"Affordability and flexibility are critical in today\\'s dynamic job market\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_0', 'query': 'Benefits of a four-year college degree on lifetime earnings', 'title': 'The Economic Impact of College Degrees', 'url': 'https://collegepossible.org/news/the-economic-impact-of-college-degrees/'}, {'id': '0_2', 'query': 'Benefits of a four-year college degree on lifetime earnings', 'title': 'Is It Still Worth Going to College? - San Francisco Fed', 'url': 'https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2014/05/is-college-worth-it-education-tuition-wages/'}]\n**Short Argument**: The claim that a four-year degree's cost outweighs its benefits is inaccurate for the majority.  Studies show bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime, recouping college costs. For example, they earn $2.3 million more than high school graduates (College Possible), and the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 (San Francisco Fed).  This demonstrates a clear financial advantage for degree holders.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Attacked Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"A bachelor\\'s degree opens doors to a wider range of career opportunities.\", \"argument\": [\"Indeed.com advises that a bachelor\\'s degree keeps more career doors open, especially for leadership positions or pursuing advanced degrees.\", \"Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data highlights that a significant 30% of jobs still require a bachelor\\\\u2019s or higher.\", \"Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) reinforces that a bachelor\\\\u2019s degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"23% of bachelor\\'s degrees offer a negative return on investment (FREOPP)\\\\\", \\\\\"Rising cost of tuition (College Values Online)\\\\\", \\\\\"Crushing weight of student loan debt can negate potential financial gains\\\\\", \\\\\"Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits (Learn.org)\\\\\", \\\\\"Flexibility of online learning\\\\\", \\\\\"Affordability and flexibility are critical in today\\'s dynamic job market\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives to four-year degrees.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits (Learn.org)\\\\\", \\\\\"Flexibility of online learning\\\\\", \\\\\"Affordability and flexibility are critical in today\\'s dynamic job market\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Bill Gates and Steve Jobs revolutionized technology after dropping out of college (Mashable)\\\\\", \\\\\"Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16 (Develop Good Habits)\\\\\", \\\\\"Entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_20', 'query': \"Statistics on lifetime earnings with a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Research Summary: Education and Lifetime Earnings', 'url': 'https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html'}, {'id': '2_5', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Average Salary With vs. Without a College Degree | Indeed.com', 'url': 'https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/average-salary-with-college-degree-vs-without'}, {'id': '2_7', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': \"Fast growth, good pay\u2014without a bachelor's degree\", 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2023/data-on-display/fast-growth-good-pay-without-a-bachelors-degree.htm'}, {'id': '2_31', 'query': \"Unemployment rates for bachelor's degree holders vs. high school diploma holders\", 'title': 'Career Outlook article page - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2021/data-on-display/education-pays.htm'}]\n\n**Long Argument**: While alternative paths to success exist, a bachelor's degree demonstrably broadens career horizons.  The BLS, a leading source of U.S. labor market data, reveals that nearly a third of all jobs require at least a bachelor's degree (2022 data). This widespread requirement, identified through the BLS's rigorous data collection methods and publicly available via their official website, underscores the significance of a bachelor's degree for accessing numerous professional fields.  Furthermore, Indeed.com, a highly reputable job search platform with extensive insights into employer preferences, affirms the bachelor's degree as crucial for unlocking leadership roles and advanced studies.  Addressing the counterargument about cost, the long-term financial benefits, including higher earning potential and lower unemployment rates as documented by the BLS and SSA, often outweigh the initial investment.  Therefore, while individual circumstances vary, a bachelor's degree remains a powerful tool for expanding career possibilities.\n\n\n### Action: Reinforce Proposed Claim\n**Our Claims to be reinforced**: ['{\"claim\": \"Pursuing a four-year college degree at an accredited institution remains beneficial for the majority of young adults in contemporary society, offering significant advantages in terms of career prospects, personal development, and societal contribution, recognizing that diverse pathways to success exist and acknowledging the need for continued investment in affordable and accessible higher education.\", \"argument\": [\"Pursuing a four-year college degree at an accredited institution remains beneficial for the majority of young adults in contemporary society, offering significant advantages in terms of career prospects, personal development, and societal contribution, recognizing that diverse pathways to success exist and acknowledging the need for continued investment in affordable and accessible higher education.\", \"Cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills (supported by research and employer demand).\", \"Expands career opportunities and earning potential (backed by job market data and industry insights).\", \"Promotes economic mobility and reduces income inequality (evidenced by economic studies and projections).\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_43', 'query': 'Unemployment rates for those with a four-year degree vs. those without', 'title': 'High school graduates with no college had unemployment rate of 4.5 ...', 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/high-school-graduates-with-no-college-had-unemployment-rate-of-4-5-percent-in-february-2022.htm'}, {'id': '1_11', 'query': 'Does college improve critical thinking skills?', 'title': 'Does College Teach Critical Thinking?

        "statements": "Look, they've got a point about college costs, but they're missing the big picture \u2013 the long-term payoff. They talk about successful dropouts, but that's not the whole story, right?  So, let's tackle their points one by one, okay?\n\nThey say a degree isn't worth the money, pointing to folks who didn't get a good return.  But, you know, studies show that's not typical. Studies from College Possible demonstrate that bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime\u2014a whopping $2.3 million more than high school graduates [1].  The San Francisco Fed adds that the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 [2].  So, while costs are real, the long-term financial benefits are clear.\n\nThey highlight online courses and certifications as affordable alternatives. Sure, online courses teach you stuff, but they don't give you the same solid education and recognition as a degree.  Imagine this: You're trying to get a job, right?  Who gets a closer look, the candidate with a recognized degree or one with various online certifications? A degree holds weight, opening doors to more opportunities.\n\nThey showcase successful dropouts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  These stories are inspiring, yeah, but they're not how things usually go. Data from the Social Security Administration shows a substantial earnings gap. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates [3]. These outliers shouldn\u2019t overshadow the statistically proven financial advantage of a degree.\n\nOkay, so, let's go back over what we've talked about.  We\u2019ve shown that a college education cultivates vital skills. Think about yourself facing a tough problem at work. A meta-analysis in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant gains in critical thinking during college [4].  These skills are crucial for navigating today's complex world. Furthermore, 82.9% of employers say they want this very skill in new hires [5]. This means your investment in education is an investment in your future career.\n\nWe've also shown that a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics states almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree [6].  This isn't just about numbers, it's about your future. With a degree, you are prepared for the workforce and its evolving demands.  This directly impacts your earning potential, as highlighted by Indeed.com, by opening up more high-level positions [7]. They also stated that without the proper credentials, opportunities are limited, especially higher management roles or those requiring advanced study. This higher earning potential contributes to economic stability and long-term financial security, making a degree a worthwhile investment.\n\nFinally, we've shown how a college degree enhances economic mobility.  The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, using robust Census and education data, projects trillions in added earnings for college graduates [8].  This fuels economic growth and benefits society.  They further emphasized education's essential role in social mobility, enhancing one's capacity to improve their economic circumstances. This reinforces the link between a college education and improved financial outcomes, contributing to a stronger economy overall.\n\nIn conclusion, while alternative paths exist, a four-year college degree offers significant advantages in terms of skills development, career prospects, and economic mobility. These long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs, making it a valuable investment for young adults in today\u2019s world.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] College Possible.

        "statements": "They mention long-term gains, right? But, they totally forget how expensive a four-year degree is right now. They say degrees guarantee success, but let's be honest, that's just not how it works. Okay, so let's tackle their arguments directly.  They brush off successful dropouts, but those stories are real.  While they cite statistics about higher earnings for graduates, Praxis profiles 125 successful individuals without degrees, across many fields [1]. These aren't just exceptions; they're proof that success doesn't always need a degree. And this leads me to their main point on long-term value.\n\nThey highlight this $2.3 million lifetime earning thing, but honestly, that's missing a lot. Consider this: the FREOPP study reveals a stark reality \u2013 nearly a quarter of bachelor's degrees lead to a negative return on investment [2].  And it gets worse: a staggering 43% of both two-year and master's degrees fail to deliver any financial gain.  So, before you bank on that $2.3 million, remember the significant number of graduates struggling to even break even. The rosy picture they paint ignores these stark statistics.\n\nThey're all about critical thinking from college, but where's the proof it helps you get a job?  They cite studies showing cognitive growth during college, but what good is that if graduates can't find suitable jobs? Research indicates a stark reality: 52% of recent college graduates are underemployed [3]. This means their expensive degrees aren't translating into fulfilling careers. It\u2019s not just about learning to think critically; it's about being able to use those skills in a job that values them.  This brings me to their argument about online alternatives.\n\nThey say online courses aren't worth much, but employers are starting to think differently. They talk about prestige, but is a degree you're drowning in debt for really better than skills employers need?  Learn.org's data reveals that online credits cost significantly less \u2013 sometimes thousands less per credit \u2013 than traditional college, both public and private [4].  This financial advantage lets you invest in yourself without crippling debt.  Furthermore, platforms like Continents.us emphasize the benefits of flexible online learning.  You control your pace and focus on skills directly relevant to the job market, something traditional degrees often miss. And let\u2019s not forget: increasingly, employers prioritize skills over degrees, as Forbes highlights [5].  So, while a degree might look good on paper, demonstrable skills land you the job. This leads us back to the financial reality of college.\n\nThey say you'll earn back tuition by 40, but that ignores the huge problems of high costs and big loans. College Values Online data shows tuition has increased by a whopping 747.8% since 1963 [6]. That's astronomical! This financial strain is made worse by student loan debt, averaging over $37,000 per borrower [7].  This crushing debt burden can delay major life milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or even just saving for retirement.  It's a financial anchor that can weigh you down for decades, severely limiting your financial freedom and future prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge the shifting landscape of education and the job market. The increasing costs, the emergence of viable alternatives, and the proven success of non-graduates demonstrate that a four-year degree isn't essential for everyone.  We urge you to consider these points and reject the notion that college is the only path to success.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Praxis. *125 Successful People Who Didn\u2019t Graduate College*. https://discoverpraxis.com/blog/13067/125-successful-people-who-didnt-graduate-college\n[2] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. *Does College Pay Off?

Note that these are average tuition and fees for all public and private institutions. Students must also consider room and board, textbooks and supplies, and living expenses. Financial aid can cover tuition and fees, room and board, and books but not the incidental costs.\u00a0\u00a0 The actual cost of college degrees differs between institutions, too. Fayetteville State University, for example, charges $2,262 per year on average. Harvard University, in contrast, charges an average of $59,076 per year. Featured Programs Why should students and their parents understand the cost of college over time? First, it\u2019s useful in personal financial planning. Students can expect an increase in tuition and fees, among others, and plan for it. This can include applying for more financial aid and tapping into more resources. Second, policymakers use the information to create strategies for more affordable college costs. The government works toward an educated workforce because of its crucial importance. A more educated workforce contributes to better economic growth and social development. For these reasons, we\u2019ll look at the cost of a college degree over time in the United States. We\u2019ll also discuss effective ways of dealing with the rising costs of a college degree.\u00a0 Related Articles: The History of College Tuition We classified the increase in college tuition over time into specific time frames.

A Comprehensive Return On Investment ... - FREOPP', 'url': 'https://freopp.org/whitepapers/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis/'}, {'id': '1_10', 'query': 'Cost of college tuition over time', 'title': 'Rising Costs: Cost Of College Degree Over Time', 'url': 'https://www.collegevaluesonline.com/costs/degree-over-time/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Data from FREOPP indicates a concerning trend: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment, meaning graduates may actually lose money. This directly contradicts the assumed financial benefits of a four-year degree.  Furthermore, even for profitable degrees, the returns can be modest.  With rising tuition costs, documented by sources like College Values Online, the financial burden can overshadow the potential gains for many.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Online courses and certifications offer affordable and flexible alternatives to traditional four-year programs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_0', 'query': 'Cost comparison of online courses/certifications vs. traditional 4-year college degrees', 'title': 'Online College Vs. Traditional Cost Comparison - Learn.org', 'url': 'https://learn.org/articles/online_college_vs_traditional_college_cost.html'}]\n**Short Argument**: Online courses and certifications offer significantly lower costs compared to traditional four-year degrees, providing a more affordable path to career advancement.  Learn.org's cost comparison shows online credits costing substantially less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions.  This affordability, combined with flexible learning options, makes them strong alternatives.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_1', 'query': 'successful people without college degrees', 'title': \"51 Successful People Who Didn't Go to or Finish College\", 'url': 'https://www.developgoodhabits.com/successful-people-college/'}, {'id': '4_5', 'query': 'famous entrepreneurs who dropped out of college', 'title': '12 of the most successful entrepreneurs who dropped out of college', 'url': 'https://mashable.com/article/12-entrepreneurs-who-dropped-out-of-college'}, {'id': '4_6', 'query': 'famous entrepreneurs who dropped out of college', 'title': \"51 Successful People Who Didn't Go to or Finish College\", 'url': 'https://www.developgoodhabits.com/successful-people-college/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The idea that a four-year degree guarantees success is increasingly outdated. Numerous individuals have achieved significant success without completing college.  Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, highlighted in Mashable, revolutionized technology after dropping out.  Similarly, Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, as detailed by Develop Good Habits. These examples, alongside others mentioned in various sources, demonstrate that drive, innovation, and self-education can be more impactful than formal degrees.\n\n"

        "statements": "Hey everyone, we're here to argue that a four-year degree isn't always the best path for young people today. Our opponents focus on the good stuff, but they miss some big problems with degrees these days. We agree with their definition of pursuing a four-year college degree, meaning attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree.  However, we disagree with their judging criteria. Instead of focusing solely on individual growth and societal contributions, we contend that the true measure of benefit lies in the overall value proposition. It's about seeing if the time and money you spend actually pays off in today's job market. This way, we can see the whole picture better.\n\nWe will present three key counterarguments. First, the cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates. Second, online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives. Third, many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\n\nSo, first, let's talk money. College can be really expensive.  Studies in FREOPP reveal a troubling statistic: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment [1]. Think about it: one in four grads might be worse off after getting their degree.  This completely undermines the supposed financial advantages. And even when you do make money back, it often isn't much. The rising cost of tuition, as documented by College Values Online, exacerbates this issue [2].  For many young adults, the crushing weight of student loan debt can negate any potential financial gains for years, if not decades. This brings me to our second argument.\n\nLuckily, there are other great options besides a four-year degree. Online courses and certifications provide more affordable and flexible pathways to career advancement. Think of getting a great education for way less money.  As you'll see, Learn.org provides a clear cost comparison. Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions [3]. This affordability, coupled with the flexibility of online learning, makes these options a compelling alternative for today\u2019s young adults. They learn when they want, study what they need for their career, and skip the huge tuition bills.  This flexibility and affordability are critical in today's dynamic job market.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not just about affordability, but also changing notions of success. Our final argument challenges the outdated assumption that a four-year degree guarantees success. Countless individuals have achieved remarkable success without a traditional college education.  Think about tech giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as highlighted by Mashable [4]. They revolutionized the technology landscape after dropping out of college. Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, a fact detailed by Develop Good Habits [5]. These stories, and countless others, demonstrate that entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree in today's innovative economy.  They challenge the traditional narrative and offer a different perspective on success.\n\nIn conclusion, while a four-year degree may still hold value for some, it is no longer the only or even the best path to success for all. The high costs, the emergence of affordable alternatives, and the proven success of individuals without degrees all point to a changing landscape.  We urge you to consider these realities and reject the outdated notion that a four-year degree is essential for all young adults in today's society.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.  *Does College Pay Off?

        "statements": "Look, they've got a point about college costs, but they're missing the big picture \u2013 the long-term payoff. They talk about successful dropouts, but that's not the whole story, right?  So, let's tackle their points one by one, okay?\n\nThey say a degree isn't worth the money, pointing to folks who didn't get a good return.  But, you know, studies show that's not typical. Studies from College Possible demonstrate that bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime\u2014a whopping $2.3 million more than high school graduates [1].  The San Francisco Fed adds that the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 [2].  So, while costs are real, the long-term financial benefits are clear.\n\nThey highlight online courses and certifications as affordable alternatives. Sure, online courses teach you stuff, but they don't give you the same solid education and recognition as a degree.  Imagine this: You're trying to get a job, right?  Who gets a closer look, the candidate with a recognized degree or one with various online certifications? A degree holds weight, opening doors to more opportunities.\n\nThey showcase successful dropouts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  These stories are inspiring, yeah, but they're not how things usually go. Data from the Social Security Administration shows a substantial earnings gap. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates [3]. These outliers shouldn\u2019t overshadow the statistically proven financial advantage of a degree.\n\nOkay, so, let's go back over what we've talked about.  We\u2019ve shown that a college education cultivates vital skills. Think about yourself facing a tough problem at work. A meta-analysis in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant gains in critical thinking during college [4].  These skills are crucial for navigating today's complex world. Furthermore, 82.9% of employers say they want this very skill in new hires [5]. This means your investment in education is an investment in your future career.\n\nWe've also shown that a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics states almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree [6].  This isn't just about numbers, it's about your future. With a degree, you are prepared for the workforce and its evolving demands.  This directly impacts your earning potential, as highlighted by Indeed.com, by opening up more high-level positions [7]. They also stated that without the proper credentials, opportunities are limited, especially higher management roles or those requiring advanced study. This higher earning potential contributes to economic stability and long-term financial security, making a degree a worthwhile investment.\n\nFinally, we've shown how a college degree enhances economic mobility.  The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, using robust Census and education data, projects trillions in added earnings for college graduates [8].  This fuels economic growth and benefits society.  They further emphasized education's essential role in social mobility, enhancing one's capacity to improve their economic circumstances. This reinforces the link between a college education and improved financial outcomes, contributing to a stronger economy overall.\n\nIn conclusion, while alternative paths exist, a four-year college degree offers significant advantages in terms of skills development, career prospects, and economic mobility. These long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs, making it a valuable investment for young adults in today\u2019s world.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] College Possible.

This suggests that nearly a quarter of students investing in a four-year education may not see a financial return.  Furthermore, the College Values Online report documents the dramatic increase in tuition costs over time, which exacerbates the financial strain on students and graduates.  Specifically, they report a 747.8% increase since 1963 (inflation adjusted), underscoring the growing financial burden of higher education.  Combined with the weight of student loan debt, averaging $37,088 per federal borrower (The College Investor, 2024), the potential financial gains of a degree are significantly offset for a substantial portion of graduates.

While median earnings are a useful statistical measure, it doesn't capture the full picture of individual success outside traditional paths.  Focusing solely on median income for graduates while disregarding the documented achievements of numerous dropouts creates a skewed narrative. These individuals' entrepreneurial ventures, tech innovations, and creative contributions cannot be ignored.   It's possible for someone to earn significantly more than the median without a college degree, while graduates' income can also fall below the median. Therefore, the focus should expand beyond median income and acknowledge multiple pathways to success.",

In 2016, I conducted a research study, An Examination of Perceived Employability Skills between Employers and College Graduates, that compared how employers perceived the employability skills of college graduates and how college graduates perceived their own skills. I found that there is a significant gap between what employers expect of their new hires and what college graduates can offer.

A 2018 study by the James G. Martin Center revealed discrepancies between employer expectations and graduate skills, particularly in areas requiring critical thinking. The Strada Institute and Burning Glass Institute's 2024 report found 52% of recent graduates underemployed in jobs not requiring a degree, indicating a failure to translate academic critical thinking into practical workplace skills. This high underemployment rate, coupled with evidence of the skills gap, directly contradicts the assertion that a college education effectively prepares students for the job market by cultivating critical thinking.  While NACE's 2021 survey reports employers valuing critical thinking, this demand doesn't appear to translate into hiring practices, given the prevalence of underemployment. It's possible that employers struggle to accurately assess critical thinking during the hiring process or that graduates aren't effectively demonstrating these skills. The disconnect between claimed employer demand and actual hiring outcomes weakens the argument that college sufficiently develops critical thinking for the job market. A counterargument might be that critical thinking is a long-term skill that doesn't immediately translate to employability. However, the high underemployment rate suggests a more fundamental deficiency in practical skill application, not simply a delayed return on investment in critical thinking.",

This suggests that nearly a quarter of students investing in a four-year education may not see a financial return.  Furthermore, the College Values Online report documents the dramatic increase in tuition costs over time, which exacerbates the financial strain on students and graduates.

Combined with the weight of student loan debt, averaging $37,088 per federal borrower (The College Investor, 2024), the potential financial gains of a degree are significantly offset for a substantial portion of graduates.

While median earnings are a useful statistical measure, it doesn't capture the full picture of individual success outside traditional paths.  Focusing solely on median income for graduates while disregarding the documented achievements of numerous dropouts creates a skewed narrative. These individuals' entrepreneurial ventures, tech innovations, and creative contributions cannot be ignored.   It's possible for someone to earn significantly more than the median without a college degree, while graduates' income can also fall below the median.

This data demonstrates the potential for considerable savings.  Furthermore, online learning's flexibility empowers students to learn at their own pace, focusing on immediately relevant material, which is advantageous in the fast-paced job market.

In 2016, I conducted a research study, An Examination of Perceived Employability Skills between Employers and College Graduates, that compared how employers perceived the employability skills of college graduates and how college graduates perceived their own skills. I found that there is a significant gap between what employers expect of their new hires and what college graduates can offer.

A 2018 study by the James G. Martin Center revealed discrepancies between employer expectations and graduate skills, particularly in areas requiring critical thinking. The Strada Institute and Burning Glass Institute's 2024 report found 52% of recent graduates underemployed in jobs not requiring a degree, indicating a failure to translate academic critical thinking into practical workplace skills. This high underemployment rate, coupled with evidence of the skills gap, directly contradicts the assertion that a college education effectively prepares students for the job market by cultivating critical thinking.  While NACE's 2021 survey reports employers valuing critical thinking, this demand doesn't appear to translate into hiring practices, given the prevalence of underemployment. It's possible that employers struggle to accurately assess critical thinking during the hiring process or that graduates aren't effectively demonstrating these skills. The disconnect between claimed employer demand and actual hiring outcomes weakens the argument that college sufficiently develops critical thinking for the job market. A counterargument might be that critical thinking is a long-term skill that doesn't immediately translate to employability. However, the high underemployment rate suggests a more fundamental deficiency in practical skill application, not simply a delayed return on investment in critical thinking.",

The fact that 52% of recent graduates are underemployed (Strada Institute/Burning Glass Institute, 2024) suggests a deficiency in applying critical thinking to real-world job needs, undermining the claim that college effectively cultivates these skills.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Attacked Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"The cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates.\", \"argument\": [\"FREOPP study showing 23% of bachelor\\'s degrees offer a negative return on investment\", \"Rising cost of tuition according to College Values Online\", \"Crushing weight of student loan debt negating potential financial gains\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"A college degree is worth the cost in the long run.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Bachelor\\'s degree holders earn $2.3 million more over their lifetime than high school graduates (College Possible).\\\\\", \\\\\"The average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 (San Francisco Fed).\\\\\", \\\\\"Online courses lack the recognition and weight of a degree.\\\\\", \\\\\"A degree opens doors to more job opportunities.\\\\\", \\\\\"Almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).\\\\\", \\\\\"A degree prepares individuals for the evolving demands of the workforce.\\\\\", \\\\\"A degree opens up more high-level positions and increases earning potential (Indeed.com).\\\\\", \\\\\"College graduates contribute trillions in added earnings, fueling economic growth (Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce).\\\\\", \\\\\"Education plays an essential role in social mobility, improving economic circumstances.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"A bachelor\\'s degree expands career opportunities.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2022).\\\\\", \\\\\"A degree prepares individuals for the evolving demands of the workforce.\\\\\", \\\\\"A degree opens up more high-level positions and increases earning potential (Indeed.com).\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"A college degree enhances economic mobility.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"College graduates contribute trillions in added earnings, fueling economic growth (Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce).\\\\\", \\\\\"Education plays an essential role in social mobility, improving economic circumstances.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_0', 'query': 'Return on investment of a four year college degree', 'title': 'Does College Pay Off?

A FREOPP study highlights that 23% of bachelor's degree programs offer a negative ROI. The College Values Online report demonstrates the escalating cost of tuition over time, increasing by 747.8% since 1963 (adjusted for inflation).

Learn.org's data reveals significantly lower per-credit costs for online courses compared to traditional colleges, both public and private.  This affordability is crucial in today's competitive job market.  Moreover, the flexible nature of online learning allows students to tailor their education to their schedules and career goals, directly addressing employer demand for specific skills highlighted by resources like Forbes.

        "statements": "They mention long-term gains, right? But, they totally forget how expensive a four-year degree is right now. They say degrees guarantee success, but let's be honest, that's just not how it works. Okay, so let's tackle their arguments directly.  They brush off successful dropouts, but those stories are real.  While they cite statistics about higher earnings for graduates, Praxis profiles 125 successful individuals without degrees, across many fields [1]. These aren't just exceptions; they're proof that success doesn't always need a degree. And this leads me to their main point on long-term value.\n\nThey highlight this $2.3 million lifetime earning thing, but honestly, that's missing a lot. Consider this: the FREOPP study reveals a stark reality \u2013 nearly a quarter of bachelor's degrees lead to a negative return on investment [2].  And it gets worse: a staggering 43% of both two-year and master's degrees fail to deliver any financial gain.  So, before you bank on that $2.3 million, remember the significant number of graduates struggling to even break even. The rosy picture they paint ignores these stark statistics.\n\nThey're all about critical thinking from college, but where's the proof it helps you get a job?  They cite studies showing cognitive growth during college, but what good is that if graduates can't find suitable jobs? Research indicates a stark reality: 52% of recent college graduates are underemployed [3]. This means their expensive degrees aren't translating into fulfilling careers. It\u2019s not just about learning to think critically; it's about being able to use those skills in a job that values them.  This brings me to their argument about online alternatives.\n\nThey say online courses aren't worth much, but employers are starting to think differently. They talk about prestige, but is a degree you're drowning in debt for really better than skills employers need?  Learn.org's data reveals that online credits cost significantly less \u2013 sometimes thousands less per credit \u2013 than traditional college, both public and private [4].  This financial advantage lets you invest in yourself without crippling debt.  Furthermore, platforms like Continents.us emphasize the benefits of flexible online learning.  You control your pace and focus on skills directly relevant to the job market, something traditional degrees often miss. And let\u2019s not forget: increasingly, employers prioritize skills over degrees, as Forbes highlights [5].  So, while a degree might look good on paper, demonstrable skills land you the job. This leads us back to the financial reality of college.\n\nThey say you'll earn back tuition by 40, but that ignores the huge problems of high costs and big loans. College Values Online data shows tuition has increased by a whopping 747.8% since 1963 [6]. That's astronomical! This financial strain is made worse by student loan debt, averaging over $37,000 per borrower [7].  This crushing debt burden can delay major life milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or even just saving for retirement.  It's a financial anchor that can weigh you down for decades, severely limiting your financial freedom and future prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge the shifting landscape of education and the job market. The increasing costs, the emergence of viable alternatives, and the proven success of non-graduates demonstrate that a four-year degree isn't essential for everyone.  We urge you to consider these points and reject the notion that college is the only path to success.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Praxis. *125 Successful People Who Didn\u2019t Graduate College*. https://discoverpraxis.com/blog/13067/125-successful-people-who-didnt-graduate-college\n[2] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. *Does College Pay Off?

Beyond the widely analyzed role of academic motivation, this study focused on the added value of social problem-solving ability in student adjustment in the academic context. Analyses based on the responses obtained from 253 students (197 women and 56 men) indicated the significant role of social problem-solving ability in student adjustment, with a small additional amount (f__2\u2009=\u2009.09) 9% of variance in life satisfaction and medium additional amount (f__2\u2009=\u2009.17) 15% of variance in depressive symptoms, beyond academic motivation. In particular, negative problem orientation was an important predictor of depressive symptoms (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.41, p\u2009<\u2009.001) and life satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u2009\u2212\u2009.26, p\u2009<\u2009.001); however, positive problem orientation was only an important predictor of life satisfaction (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009.21, p\u2009<\u2009.01). This study also showed the predictive role of the value, expectancy, and affection components of motivation in student adjustment.

Abstract Developing problem solving in university students is a crucial topic in education today. Based on existing theories and research, this study proposed nine hypotheses as well as constructed a chained dual-mediation model to investigate the pathways through which college students' self-efficacy affects problem-solving disposition. The obtained influence path model fully considered the relationship between self-efficacy and problem-solving disposition, and investigated the mediating roles of metacognition disposition and critical thinking disposition between the two. The study used scales to collect data from 346 university students from East China, including their self-efficacy, metacognition disposition, critical thinking disposition, and problem-solving disposition. The study underwent a rigorous validation process, and the scales were confirmed to have satisfactory reliability, structural validity, convergent validity, and discriminant validity ",

Abstract In recent years, the debate has continued among researchers and instructors regarding the influence of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) on the effectiveness of instructional intervention for Critical Thinking (CT) in higher education. This study, conducting a meta-analysis by synthesizing 50 relevant empirical studies from 2000 to 2021 with 5,210 participants and 58 effect sizes, aims to present potential factors (i.e., sample size, sample type, instruction type, gender, maturity, instrument, nationality, discipline, treatment duration, and group size) that may influence the effectiveness of the cultivation of CT skills and disposition on the basis of PBL. No evident publication bias was found (Egger's bias\u00a0\\=\u00a01.21, p\u00a0>\u00a00.05). From the general perspective, the results demonstrate the high level of influence of PBL (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD]\u00a0\\=\u00a00.640, p\u00a0<\u00a00.001) on CT with heterogeneity (I2\u00a0\\=\u00a082.9%) due to the adopted instruments, mixed methods, and target outcomes, and no difference was observed between influence on CT skills and disposition.

Specifically, little is known about what factors contribute to students developing a disposition to think critically or what impact this disposition has on college students\u2019 academic achievement. Perceived control, which has been found to be an important factor in college students\u2019 academic success, may be an important factor in developing this disposition. The current longitudinal study examined the reciprocal-effects between critical thinking disposition and perceived academic control, and their comparative influences on academic achievement in 1196 first-year college students. Using a two-wave, two-variable cross-lag structural equation model, a reciprocal-effect was found whereby students\u2019 perceived academic control predicted their subsequent critical thinking disposition, and students\u2019 critical thinking disposition predicted their subsequent perceived academic control. Furthermore, after controlling for high school academic performance, perceived academic control was found to have a stronger impact on students\u2019 GPAs than critical thinking disposition. Implications of fostering a critical thinking disposition and perceived academic control among college students are discussed.

Abstract Purpose Numerous cross-sectional studies have explored the correlation between study engagement and critical thinking, but the relationship between the development of these two key variables over time is unclear and the causal relationship between them remains controversial. In this study, we examined the developmental trajectories of and the interplay between study engagement and critical thinking. Methods We used a questionnaire method to follow 654 first-year students in Chinese higher vocational college over a period of one year and three times, of which 231 (35.321%) were male and 423 (64.679%) were female, with a",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of complex-problem solving (CPS) skills in undergraduate students\u2019 university success in two independent samples. In Study 1, 165 university students completed a measure of intelligence as well as a measure of CPS. In addition, students\u2019 university grade point averages (GPAs) and their subjective evaluation of academic success were collected. CPS made a significant contribution to the explanation of GPAs and the subjective success evaluations even when controlling for intelligence. To further investigate this effect, Study 2 relied on an independent and more heterogeneous sample of 216 university students. The findings of Study 1 were essentially replicated in Study 2. Thus, the combined results demonstrate a link between individual differences in CPS and the abilities necessary to be academically successful in university education.

As an educator or administrator, you\u2019re at the helm of shaping the next generation of critical thinkers, and it\u2019s imperative to understand how problem-solving skills can be fostered effectively within the academic environment. This article examines the essence of problem solving in higher education, and the robust skills that can be nurtured to prepare students for the demands of an increasingly complex global landscape. Unveiling the Essence of Problem Solving in Academia Problem solving is the application of logical and analytical skills to address issues through a blend of knowledge, intuition, and creativity. It involves structured paths to the resolution, often including research, analysis, and application of methodologies. These skills form a tapestry that binds the diverse facets of the education process, from traditional lecture formats to practical applications such as research projects and internships. In essence, problem-solving in higher education signifies the ability of students to: This multifaceted approach not only enhances their learning experience but also prepares them for a lifetime of addressing challenges in their personal and professional lives. The Bifocal Prism of Curriculum Enhancement An enriched curriculum serves as the perfect conduit for fostering problem-solving abilities among students. It requires a recalibration that shifts the focus from rote learning to active engagement, incorporating real-world problems and open-ended questions. Here are the fundamental strategies to enhance the curriculum with a problem-solving lens: Relevance and Realism: Each subject area should be taught in the context of real, pressing problems, allowing students to appreciate the practical implications of ",

Mathematics boosts problem solving skills and, in Higher Education, all scientific degree programs deliver at least one module in Mathematics that should develop students\u2019 problem solving skills. Mathematics Modules of the Biotechnology Bachelor Degree and of the Strategic Science Bachelor and Master Degrees at the University of Turin use innovative digital technologies, like the Advanced Computing Environment Maple, and methodologies to facilitate the learning of Mathematics and the development of problem solving skills. At the beginning of the courses, students must learn how to use Maple through dedicated lab sessions to solve contextualized problems related to their future careers. Moreover, for the final examination, students must study, present and discuss a science-based problem solved with Maple. In this paper, we investigated how the use of Maple enabled students to develop problem solving skills. We examined 110 students\u2019 submissions through a rubric that analyzes different dimensions: comprehension, resolution strategy identi",

No system is perfect and sound decision-making is critical to navigating a challenging world. Earning a master\u2019s degree in data science gives analysts and data professionals the skills essential in a transformative new century. We live in the age of big data, but without data management, analytics, and actionable insight, it is little more than a pile of bricks instead of the solid house it could or should be. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how much data you have,\u201d writes\u00a0Param Hegde in a\u00a0Medium\u00a0article. \u201cWhat matters is what insight you are getting out of it.\u201d Data informs sound decision-making to the extent that it is effectively applied to real-world problems. The power of data, therefore, is unlocked by data scientists\u2019 technical and analytical skills. The value and demand for data scientists are commensurate with the rise of data as the lifeblood of businesses, organizations, and society. A data scientist\u2019s role has never been more critical than now, though not as much as next year or the year after. A master\u2019s degree in data science clears the path to an exciting career in the public and private sectors. Let\u2019s briefly explore how data science is critical to problem-solving, forecasting, and solving modern business challenges. Time is Money; Data is Money The saying goes that \u201ctime is money.\u201d The corollary is that data is money. With data, problems are identified and solutions discovered. Wasted data is lost time and money. Data analysis saves time (and money) by safeguarding against ill-informed decision-making. Leading through data analysis is both tactical and strategic. That leadership begins not with a complex algorithm but by first identifying a problem to be solved. Referring to our previous analogy, we must decide on the house that needs building before we collect the materials to construct it. Technical and analytical skills are essential, but data science requires matching problems with th",

The https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely. 10 Growing Jobs That Pay Well and Don\u2019t Need a 4-Year Degree If you're thinking about starting a new career, data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics can help you understand the demand for different occupations, what kind of education or training you\u2019ll need and how much they may pay. For example, our data show that \u2013 as a group \u2013 occupations typically requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree or graduate degree are expected to grow faster than the average of 2.8% projected for the total economy from 2022-32. And the median pay for occupations requiring a bachelor\u2019s ($81,570), master\u2019s ($80,180), or doctoral or professional degree ($114,020) is much higher median for all occupations \u2013 $46,310 in 2022. However, plenty of opportunities exist for workers without a bachelor\u2019s degree. In 2022, about 7 out of 10 jobs were in occupations that don't require a 4-year degree for entry. Here's a closer look at 10 that don't need a bachelor's, are expected to grow considerably faster than average and that pay above the median. For example, wind turbine service technicians are projected to grow faster than any other occupation from 2022-32 (44.9%) and earned above-average wages of $57,320 in 2022. Three occupations in the list \u2013 industrial machinery mechanics, forest fire inspectors and prevention specialists, and hearing aid specialists \u2013 do not require any postsecondary education for entry. However, they all require on-the-job training. Of note: More than half of the occupations featured are related to healthcare, a field that is expected to experience strong demand through the 2022-32 decade.

The previous posts can be accessed at the data blog home page. While those posts looked at earnings data of college graduates, we have yet to explore data comparing employment outcomes based on varying levels of educational attainment. Many conversations about the benefits associated with increased levels of educational attainment typically revolve around earnings, such as someone with a bachelor\u2019s degree earning approximately $1 million more in a lifetime compared to a person with a high school diploma (SSA Research Summary). At a more granular level, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks earnings data on a monthly basis through its Current Population Survey (CPS), as the BLS publishes its findings in a variety of locations. One such publication is its Education Pays\u00a0series. As shown in the visualization to the right, adults who are 25-years-old and older with a bachelor\u2019s degree earned $1,305 per week (median usual weekly earnings) in 2020, as compared to the $781 per week that an adult with",

However, a doctorate is costly for many Americans. With the steady rise in the number of associate degree and certification graduates earning equally or even more than their bachelor-holder counterparts, the counter-argument for earning a bachelor\u2019s degree echoes louder. That said, though, a bachelor\u2019s degree still provides its holder an advantage in terms of career advancement opportunities, which is why most of the jobs listed below are managerial positions that consistently break the $100,000-median annual salary mark. Besides, the fact remains that most employers, huge, multinational firms, still require a bachelor\u2019s degree from their employees even when it\u2019s not inherently necessary for the job. Let us help you find the best degree program for your career aspirations!: 50 HIGHEST PAYING CAREERS WITH ONLY A BACHELOR\u2019S DEGREE For the salary rankings, the term \u201cmedian\u201d instead of \u201caverage\u201d will be used here to describe the annual wage. This is to factor out salary outliers, that present an effect if the averaging measure is used.

Earning your bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree tends to lead to higher salaries and lower unemployment rates than high school graduates experience, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) [1]. However, some bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degrees can lead to more high-paying jobs than others, either at the outset of your career or by the midpoint of it.\u00c2\u00a0 For example, the most popular majors, which include business, health professions, engineering, and biomedical sciences, all tend to lead to high-paying jobs after graduation [2]. But liberal arts majors typically achieve a comparable salary by the mid-point of their career. In other words, they may make less to start, but will eventually earn as much as their STEM counterparts thanks to the transferable nature of their skill set, according to New York Times [3].\u00c2\u00a0 In this article, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll go over 14 high-paying jobs that require less than five years of experience, and the six high-paying management tracks you can typically explore after gaining at least five years of experience.\u00c2\u00a0 14 high-paying jobs with less than five years of experience We\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve compiled a list of 14 jobs that span majors and tend to pay above-average salaries [4].

The jobs listed below require a bachelor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s degree and little to no experience, according to BLS, though you may find that different companies have different expectations when it comes to minimum experience. The type of salary you can earn for each of the jobs listed below, which we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve collected from both BLS and Glassdoor, will also likely depend on your experience, the seniority of the job title, and where you live.\u00c2\u00a0 Translator\u00c2\u00a0 The increasingly global nature of business requires working with companies, clients, and customers in different languages.

The previous posts can be accessed at the data blog home page. While those posts looked at earnings data of college graduates, we have yet to explore data comparing employment outcomes based on varying levels of educational attainment. Many conversations about the benefits associated with increased levels of educational attainment typically revolve around earnings, such as someone with a bachelor\u2019s degree earning approximately $1 million more in a lifetime compared to a person with a high school diploma (SSA Research Summary). At a more granular level, the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) tracks earnings data on a monthly basis through its Current Population Survey (CPS), as the BLS publishes its findings in a variety of locations. One such publication is its Education Pays\u00a0series. As shown in the visualization to the right, adults who are 25-years-old and older with a bachelor\u2019s degree earned $1,305 per week (median usual weekly earnings) in 2020, as compared to the $781 per week that an adult with",

Here\u2019s one reason to continue: workers\u2019 earnings increase as educational attainment rises, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics\u00a0(BLS). In 2022, for example, workers age 25 and over without a high school diploma had median weekly earnings of $682. Workers whose highest level of education was a diploma made $853 per week, or just over 25 percent more than those who didn\u2019t finish high school\u2014and earnings improved with every level of education completed.

If that\u2019s not a compelling enough reason to stay in school, here\u2019s another: BLS data also show that more education means less unemployment. In 2022, people without a diploma had the highest unemployment rate (5.5 percent) among those at all education levels, with unemployment rates decreasing as education increased.

                  "raw_content": " Turning Community Colleges into Engines of Economic Mobility and Dynamism Community colleges should be drivers of economic mobility, employment, and dynamism in local communities. Unlike four-year institutions, many of which are highly selective and pose significant barriers to entry, two-year colleges are intended to serve people from a wide range of life circumstances. In theory, they are highly egalitarian institutions that enable underserved individuals to access learning, jobs, and opportunities that would otherwise not be available to them. However, community colleges are asked to do a lot of things with relatively little funding: they serve individuals ranging from highly gifted high school students to prospective transfers to four-year universities to people earning skilled trades certificates. This spreads schools\u2019 attention broadly and is especially problematic given the wide range of non-academic challenges that many of their low-income students face, such as raising dependents and lack of access to reliable transportation. Troublingly, many community college degrees do not result in an economic return on investment (ROI) for their students, and many students will not recoup their investment within five years of completing a community college credential. To address these issues, policymakers should reform community colleges in two essential ways. First, community colleges should align curricula toward fields with high wages and strong employer demand while increasing the amount of work-based learning. This shift would provide more job-ready graduates and improve student salaries and employment rates, thereby increasing student ROI. Second, the federal government should provide greater financial assistance in the form of Pell Grants and funding for wraparound services such as transportation vouchers and textbooks, allowing more students to access high-quality community college programs and graduate on time. These are interventions with a track record of proven success but require greater funding and su",

The research draws upon a dozen nationally representative datasets on college enrollment and completion between 1908 and 1995 as well as tax data from more recent years. It is one of the first studies to examine this link over such an extended period of time. Researchers Michelle Jackson from Stanford and Brian Holzman from Rice's Houston Education Research Consortium, part of the Kinder Institute for Urban Research and School of Social Sciences, found that income and educational inequality moved in lockstep with one another throughout the 20th century. The authors said previous studies of this topic, which haven't examined data going so far back in time, did not reveal such a strong link. Their paper detailed how inequality in college enrollment and completion rose in the 1930s and 1940s amid rising income inequality; was low for Americans born in the late 1950s and 1960s, when income inequality was low; and rose again for Americans born in the late 1980s, when income inequality peaked. This U-turn indicates the nation is experiencing levels of collegiate inequality not seen for generations, the authors wrote. \"Long story short, the findings reveal that longstanding worries about income inequality and its relationship to college opportunity are warranted,\" Holzman said. One notable exception was during the Vietnam War. For young people at risk of serving in the war, collegiate inequality was high while income inequality was low. During this period, inequality in college enrollment and completion was significantly hi",

Industry Insights Income Inequality and the Earnings Gap Between Educated and Non-Educated Workers Income inequality exists in every society or country due to the differences in education, gender, race, region, and/or other factors. It may impact a society in several different areas, including the economy, education, crime, and health and life expectancy. Education is arguably one of the primary factors that cause income inequality. Recent studies show that the earnings gap between workers with a Bachelor\u2019s or more advanced degree and workers with a high school diploma has been widening. And this widening of income inequality is said to negatively affect higher education. As those non-educated workers become poorer, they have difficulty sending their children to college. Some economists claim that if our society can produce more college-graduating workers, income inequality between educated workers and non-educated workers may be reduced. How can it be possible? How Does Income Inequality Affect the Economy? According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) report, income inequality has been increasing in most OECD countries during the past 30 years (OECD, 2014).

Drawing from economics, sociology, and higher education research, this study interrogates the complexities of the relationship between students and institutions to understand what factors influence an institution\u2019s ability to facilitate upward socioeconomic mobility. Drawing data from Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, Baccalaureate and Beyond 08/12, and Opportunity Insights data, multi-level structural equation modeling was employed to examine how institutional quality, mediated by peer environment and compositional racial diversity of faculty and staff, explain differences in institutional intergenerational mobility rates across institutions. The findings reveal that higher levels of institutional quality and peer environment were associated with lower levels of intergenerational mobility. In contrast, institutions with higher percentages of faculty and staff of color had higher intergenerational mobility rates. These findings demonstrate the importance of examining institutional factors in relation to intergenerational mobility.

Her family of five took up residence in the Arlington Suites, a low-budget motel astutely chosen by her mother for its proximity to the academically rigorous Myers Park High School. That year, KiKi found herself sitting in the bathroom each night, typing her homework assignments on a cracked phone while her family slept in a shared single room. KiKi\u2019s hard work was undertaken in pursuit of a brighter future, with the hope that a college degree would serve as her springboard. Her faith that a college education could lift her family out of poverty reflects an American ideal that emerged in the second half of the 20th century when veterans returning from World War II availed themselves of the free education provided by the GI Bill. As the country increasingly shifted toward a knowledge economy, a college education became a reliable pathway to a better life. Today\u2019s society is characterized by vast disparities in wealth and opportunity that create obstacles to college access and completion for many students. In fact, research shows that affluent college students are significantly more likely to earn a college degree than their less wealthy peers. Today, the picture is more complicated. Educational attainment and future earnings are more tightly connected than ever: college graduates earn 84 percent more on average than nongrads. However, today\u2019s society is characterized by vast disparities in",

Abstract We develop a new dataset using UNESCO source materials on the location of nearly 15,000 universities in about 1,500 regions across 78 countries, some dating back to the 11th Century. We estimate fixed effects models at the sub-national level between 1950 and 2010 and find that increases in the number of universities are positively associated with future growth of GDP per capita (and this relationship is robust to controlling for a host of observables, as well as unobserved regional trends). Our estimates imply that a 10% increase in a region's number of universities per capita is associated with 0.4% higher future GDP per capita in that region. Furthermore, there appear to be positive spillover effects from universities to geographically close neighbouring regions. We show that the relationship between GDP per capita and universities is not simply driven by the direct expenditures of the university, its staff and students. Part of the effect of universities on growth is mediated through an increased supply of human capital and greater innovation. Furthermore, we find that within countries, higher historical university presence is ",

June 4, 2019 The Economic Benefits of Educational Attainment Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Tom Lee The Economic Benefits of Educational Attainment Executive Summary Education is vital for a highly skilled and productive labor force. This study seeks to quantify the relationships between additional educational attainment and employment opportunities, wage rates, and aggregate economic growth. We find that increasing education attainment would have powerful positive effects on the economy. Specifically: In sum: Greater post-secondary educational attainment of all types would not just increase employment opportunities and wages in the labor market, but would also spur widespread and stronger economic growth. Introduction Post-secondary education has clear benefits for those looking for a job: College-educated workers, for example, face lower unemployment and obtain higher wages than their less-educated counterparts. Unfortunately, education levels are not rising to match the economy\u2019s demands. In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the unemployment rate has decreased from a high of 9.9 percent to about 3.8 percent.[1] Despite this overall improvement, the rise in U.S. education levels has not kept up with the rise in demand for highly skilled workers. This relative shortfall of skilled workers inhibits the ability of firms to meet demand, expand, and augment levels of productivity. For the state or national economy, the cascading effects of lower educational attainment translate into lower rates of aggregate growth. In this study, we quantify the economic benefits of increasing education levels. Specifically, the study measures how attaining various levels of post-secondary education beyond a high-school diploma can positively affect workers\u2019 chances of be",

Can community colleges bridge the gap? May-June 2022 Gary Jones with the truck he learned to operate at East Mississippi Community CollegePhotograph by Matthew G. Wood \u00a0\u201cWhen I started, I couldn\u2019t even drive a stick, and now I\u2019m shifting a ten-speed,\u201d says Gary Jones with the sort of smile you hear before you see it. From eight in the morning to about four in the afternoon, the 31-year-old Jones is on the road, training for his Commercial Driver\u2019s License (CDL) at East Mississippi Community College (EMCC). He spent this particular afternoon driving a semi-truck on the foggy highways connecting Starkville, West Point, and his native Columbus\u2014a group of three towns in northeast Mississippi known as the Golden Triangle region. Maybe Jones couldn\u2019t drive a stick-shift a few weeks ago, but now he can parallel park a big rig longer than a bowling lane. Jones dropped out of high school to take care of his disabled mother and younger siblings. His mom required round-the-clock care, which meant he didn\u2019t have the time to work a steady job. \u201cThat\u2019s why I ended up selling drugs and taking the wrong direction,\u201d he says. \u201cWe had to take care of her, and I was trying to help my little brother and sister, help them stay in school.\u201d Jones was eventually arrested and went to prison for five years, during which time his mother passed away. He knew his criminal history could be a barrier to employment and didn\u2019t want his education to be another one, so just a few weeks after his release, he enrolled in the Mississippi Integrated Basic Education and Skills Training (MIBEST) program at EMCC. He says, \u201cI really owed it to my mama, because she stayed in my ear about going to school and getting my GED and trying to do the right thing.\u201d As part of MIBEST, a Mississippi Community College Board program that seeks to move low-wage and non-traditi",

Why \u2018College or Bust\u2019 Limits Economic Mobility Debates about \u201ccollege versus non-college\u201d have been buzzing around conferences, social media, and the op-ed pages. The conclusion of these higher-ed hot-takes often appears to be that college is the right and only pathway to a good job, and therefore, the right and only solution to declining economic mobility is to expand college.\u00a0 This black-and-white framing is appealing to those of us in the policy ecosystem, who like easy answers proven by data\u2014but it ignores the reality that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for Americans when it comes to the questions around college. People\u2019s lives aren\u2019t binary, they\u2019re complex. The hard question for people considering college isn\u2019t, \u201cshould I earn a four-year degree?\u201d It\u2019s more akin to, \u201ccan I earn a four-year degree? Does it work for my family? My finances? My life?\u201d Our overwhelming focus on one pathway to economic mobility isn\u2019t working for far too many people, or our labor market. Rather than rehashing whether college pays off (it does, for the minority who attend and complete their degree), we must focus on the hard work of creating and valuing more pathways, so more people have a shot at the American Dream.\u00a0 As I wrote last year, \u201ccollege and\u201d not \u201ccollege or\u201d is the necessary strategy. Pragmatically, it\u2019s also the only feasible one. Let\u2019s put ourselves in the shoes of individuals asking those harder questions, for whom college might not be their best option (at least, not right now):\u00a0 These stories just examine people at the beginning of their career. The workers already in our labor force\u2014some for many decades\u2014have valuable skills that deserve recognition.

According to Learning and Earning by Degrees: Gains in College Degree Attainment Have Enriched the Nation and Every State, but Racial and Gender Inequality Persists, this rising tide of educational attainment will lead to $14.2 trillion in additional net earnings for workers over their lifetimes, bolstering the US economy through additional spending and tax revenue. Beyond the monetary gains associated with increased educational attainment, individuals with higher levels of education also have better health outcomes, a stronger resistance to authoritarianism, and higher rates of civic engagement, among other benefits. However, while all demographic groups experienced increases in college degree attainment, gaps in attainment and earnings persist between white adults and adults from marginalized racial/ethnic groups, undermining the capacity of education\u2014by itself\u2014to create an economically just world.

Findings on economic mobility from the Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking Jeff Larrimore Coming out of the Great Recession, there are renewed concerns about the level of economic opportunity throughout the income distribution and the extent to which economic advancement is a realistic goal for all American families. Recognizing this growing interest in economic mobility, this note outlines the findings on several dimensions of mobility for young adults from the Federal Reserve's 2014 Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED).1\u00a0 Economic mobility over the past generation The SHED data covers a wide array of topics, including information on the highest level of education that each of the respondent's parents completed. Since education is a strong determinant of income and socioeconomic status (see e.g. Autor 2014; Oreopoulos and Petronijevic 2013), responses to this question can be used in conjunction with other aspects of the survey to observe the level of economic mobility from one generation to the next. In doing so, we focus on individuals aged 25-44 (born between 1970 and 1989) to get a picture of mobility for the latest generation of Americans entering adulthood.2\u00a0 Figure 1 considers mobility across generations by exploring the relationship between parental education and their child's income as an adult. Among individuals whose parents both completed a bachelor's degree, 21 percent had a household income of under $50,000 in 2014 and 45 percent had over $100,000 of income. I",

Daly Download PDF (65 KB) FRBSF Economic Letter 2014-13 | May 5, 2014 Earning a four-year college degree remains a worthwhile investment for the average student. Data from U.S. workers show that the benefits of college in terms of higher earnings far outweigh the costs of a degree, measured as tuition plus wages lost while attending school. The average college graduate paying annual tuition of about $20,000 can recoup the costs of schooling by age 40. After that, the difference between earnings continues such that the average college graduate earns over $800,000 more than the average high school graduate by retirement age. Media accounts documenting the rising cost of a college education and relatively bleak job prospects for new college graduates have raised questions about whether a four-year college degree is still the right path for the average American. In this Economic Letter, we examine whether going to college remains a worthwhile investment. Using U.S. survey data, we compare annual labor earnings of college graduates with those of individuals with only a high school diploma. The data show college graduates outearn their high school counterparts as much as in past decades. Comparing the earnings benefits of college with the costs of attending a four-year program, we find that college is still worth it. This means that, for the average student, tuition costs for the majority of college education opportunities in the United States can be recouped by age 40, after which college graduates continue to earn a return on their investment in the form of higher lifetime wages.\u00a0 Earnings outcomes by educational attainment A common way to track the value of going to college is to estimate a college earnings premium, which is the amount college graduates earn relative to high school graduates. We measure earnings for each year as the annual labor income for the prior year, adjusted for inflation using the consumer price index (CPI-U), reported in 2011 dollars. The earnings ",

But who goes to college and attains degrees\u2014and the social inequalities embedded in those pathways\u2014are often obscured in the debate and not well understood. In her new book, Overcoming the Odds: The Benefits of Completing College for Unlikely Graduates, Jennie E. Brand (UCLA) provides new evidence on the benefits of a college degree, especially for the unlikeliest graduates.1 Is a College Degree Worth It? Recently, popular discourse has questioned the value of a college education. Such arguments are often based on simplistic analyses that downplay the benefits that students from disadvantaged backgrounds receive from a four-year college degree. The discourse often does not draw on statistical approaches to consider how college degrees benefit students of diverse backgrounds not only in the short-term, but over a lifetime. \u201cThe debate about the value of a college education is not always grounded in the best evidence,\u201d explains Brand. \u201cThrough advanced analytic techniques, we can better understand the lifetime benefits that college graduates realize from their education. The data overwhelmingly support degree attainment, especially for those who do so against the odds.\u201d Brand analyzes thousands of pairs of individuals who shared similar childhood backgrounds but were differentiated by a single key factor\u2014one graduated from college, and one did not. The analytic technique, called propensity score matching, allows Brand to describe the benefits that college graduates from different backgrounds receive from their degrees by using peers as their reference point. Using the breadth and depth of two cohorts of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, Brand observes people f",

A new report measures the \u201creturn on investment\u201d offered by various higher education programs. By Ann Carrns Most four-year degrees pay off by paving the way for graduates to recoup the cost of their education relatively quickly, a new analysis finds. But that\u2019s particularly true for some programs, while others may offer little economic advantage over a high school diploma. The findings are part of a report on some 38,000 post-high school degree and certificate programs published this week by Third Way, a center-left public policy group. The report analyzed data collected for the federal Education Department\u2019s \u201cCollege Scorecard\u201d tool to measure the \u201creturn on investment\u201d offered by various higher education programs. The report found that almost two-thirds of the 26,000 bachelor\u2019s degree programs in the study enabled a majority of their graduates to make enough money to recover their costs in 10 years or less after graduation. Bachelor\u2019s degree programs, which typically take four years, are generally more expensive but are most likely to show at least some return on investment \u2014 meaning graduates earn enough to pay off their college costs reasonably quickly \u2014 for those who complete a degree, compared with two-year associate degrees or shorter certificate programs. That\u2019s good news for students who completed those four-year programs, said the report\u2019s author, Michael Itzkowitz, senior fellow for higher education at Third Way and a former director of the College Scorecard. Certain fields of study, however \u2014 typically those in higher-paying fields like engineering or health care \u2014 are substantially more likely to lead to a speedier economic boost than fields like the arts, religion or biology.

It's no secret that college is expensive. Both private and public institutions ranked by U.S. News saw tuition increases for the 2022-2023 academic year, according to data submitted in an annual survey. Average tuition and fees at ranked private universities was about $40,000, while ranked public universities cost nearly $23,000 for out-of-state students and $10,500 for in-state students. In turn, the average student loan debt continues to rise, currently clocking in at about $30,000 per borrower, according to U.S. News data. Though students may encounter difficulties paying for it, college is a worthwhile investment when done wisely, experts say. In 2021, the median weekly wage for full-time workers age 25 and older who had at least a bachelor\u2019s degree was $1,334, compared to $809 for those with only a high school diploma and no college, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

By CLRN team / January 3, 2025 What College Degrees Really Mean for Your Lifetime Income When it comes to determining the value of a college degree, many students and professionals struggle to understand what their diploma is truly worth. Do degrees in certain fields lead to higher lifetime incomes? Do they provide a boost in job prospects or networking opportunities? In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the answer to this crucial question and explore the relationship between college degrees and lifetime earnings. Lifetime Income and College Majors: A Correlation Higher-Paying Majors The correlation between college majors and lifetime income is more significant than one might expect. According to the National Association of Colleges and Employers, certain majors can lead to significantly higher lifetime earnings. In 2020, the top 10 highest-paying majors during the first five years after graduation were: | Major | Median Starting Salary | Mid-Career Salary | Lifetime Earnings Potential | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | Computer Science | $104,000 | $155,000 | $2.5 million | | Aerospace Engineering | $93,000 | $140,000 | $2.3 million | | Chemical Engineering | $85,000 | $130,000 | $2.2 million | | Electrical Engineering | $83,000 | $125,000 | $2.1 million | | Mechanical Engineering | $75,000 | $115,000 | $1.9 million | Lower-Paying Majors On the other hand, certain majors, such as Education, Social Work, and the Humanities, tend to have lower median salaries. However, this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that graduates in these fields will have lower lifetime earnings. Factors such as career advancement, job prospects, and networking opportunities can also play a significant role. soft Skills Interpersonal and Communication Employers value e",

Abstract Our understanding about the relationship between education and lifetime earnings often neglects differences by field of study. Utilizing data that matches respondents in the Survey of Income and Program Participation to their longitudinal earnings records based on administrative tax information, we investigate the trajectories of annual earnings following the same individuals over 20 years and then estimate the long-term effects of field of study on earnings for U.S. men and women. Our results provide new evidence revealing large lifetime earnings gaps across field of study. We show important differences in individuals\u2019 earnings trajectories across the different stages of the work-life by field of study. In addition, the gaps in 40-year (i.e., ages 20 to 59) median lifetime earnings among college graduates by field of study are larger, in many instances, than the median gap between high school graduates and college graduates overall. Significant variation is also found among graduate degree holders. Our results uncover important similarities and differences between men and women with regard to the long-term earnings differentials associated with field of study. In general, these findings underscore field of study as a critical dimension of horizontal stratification in educational attainment. Other implications of the empirical f",

Eighth graders take the PSAT to be evaluated for college readiness, to see scholarship opportunities and to prepare for taking the SAT. College Board even hosts college information nights at middle schools to share tips for improving PSAT and SAT scores prior to the junior year of high school. Being prepared for college is a great idea - we should absolutely ensure our children understand the ins and outs of attaining a college degree. But is a college degree always worth it? Here are three reasons why a college degree should not be the only career path recommended to our students: 1. A 2015 survey found that the most important reasons students choose to pursue a four-year degree is for a high-paying job. Obviously, financial security is a priority for the majority of us and college is seen as the primary way to find that stability. Yet only 59 percent of those entering college will earn a bachelor\u2019s degree within 6 years, and many of them will graduate with a nice chunk of student debt. In fact, one in four Americans owe student debt, which currently totals $1.5 trillion. The average student debt is over $37,000 and climbing \u2014 a number that seems low to many.

The study also explores key trends in the economic outcomes of young adults among those who have and have not completed a four-year college degree. The analysis in this report is based on three data sources. The labor force, earnings, hours, household income and poverty characteristics come from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey. The findings on net worth are based on the Federal Reserve\u2019s Survey of Consumer Finances. The data on public views on the value of a college degree was collected as part of a Center survey of 5,203 U.S. adults conducted Nov. 27 to Dec. 3, 2023. Everyone who took part in the survey is a member of Pew Research Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. Address-based sampling ensures that nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about the ATP\u2019s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report, along with responses, and the survey\u2019s methodology. Young adults refers to Americans ages 25 to 34.

A potential shift to a new system will eventually change the job market. However, it\u2019s necessary to understand the main arguments for such a transformation, how it can change the economic conditions, and what students expect from higher institutions today. In this article, we will discuss all of the above. Let\u2019s get to it! The Changing Landscape of Employment The constantly evolving job market is one of the main reasons why colleges are rethinking the traditional four-year degree model. Many employers value skills and experience over formal educational degrees. Businesses are looking for candidates with practical skills, adaptability, and ability to solve actual problems. Apart from that, rapid technological change means that traditional knowledge you have acquired in college may quickly become outdated. For instance, students often ask their professors how to develop essential skills that align with real-life applications so they don\u2019t have to look for \u00a0\u201cwrite me an essay\u201d services online.

                  "raw_content": "UnemploymentData.com Your Source for Employment and Unemployment Data The Difference a Degree Makes in Unemployment Levels November 18, 2011 by Tim McMahon The Difference a College Degree Makes We\u2019re always told by our parents that we need a good education in order to get a good job. And that we will make more money if we have a good education. But these days we hear of unemployed college graduates camping out\u00a0in New York city and protesting\u00a0Wall Street because they can\u2019t find jobs. So\u00a0let\u2019s take a look at the numbers and compare the unemployment rate based on eduation level.\u00a0 In the following chart we will look at four educational levels. The first level are those people with less than a\u00a0High School\u00a0education. The second level are those with a High School diploma. The third level are those with some college education or an associates degree.\u00a0And finally those with a Four Year College Degree. As we can see from the chart above, obviously the unemployment rate is the highest for those with the least education\u2026 as we would expect. Logically if you were an employer you would lay off the least educated employees first because they are more readily replaceable. We can even tell by the numbers the actual difference a high school education makes. The average unemployment rate for the period from 1992 through October 2011 for High School graduates was 5.5% while the average for those who didn\u2019t graduate from High School was 9.2%. So simply by getting a High School education, you decreased your odds of being unemployed drastically with the actual difference being 3.7%.\u00a0 But if you look at the chart you will see that a High School education was even more valuable than that. The real benefit of being able to get a job is when jobs are scarce, so even though the average difference was 3.7% during bad times, i.e. when the overall unemployment rate is higher the difference climbs even more. First, let\u2019s look at the difference just a high school education makes. \u00a0High School Education As we can see the differential is relativel",

A social benefit means that a person who earns a college degree creates benefits for other members of society. What might those benefits be? One is that college grads live healthier, longer lives. This means they continue be productive and to pay taxes, contribute to Social Security, and so on. Better health means they make fewer demands on the healthcare system.

Your social life can make studying easier It isn\u2019t fun studying alone, and it\u2019s often easier to study if someone is there to help you. Study buddies can not only teach you new studying techniques, but they can also help you take more efficient study breaks and keep you on track \u2014\u00a0they may even make you Ramen at 1 a.m. 2. Cultural exposure Exposing yourself to a variety of social situations, whether it be joining a club, going to a party, or eating dinner downtown with your friends, allows you to develop relationships with people from other states, cultures, and countries. Expanding your social circle will help you form cross-cultural connections in your social life as well as develop a greater world perspective. Interacting with people\u00a0who come from different backgrounds, will teach you more about life than any college course will. There is no better time to expand your social circl",

The present study comprehensively synthesizes existing research on the factors correlated with personal growth initiative among collegiate populations, aims to identify all correlated factors of college students' personal growth initiative, and the level of correlation.

Consequently, the current study assessed relationships among personal growth initiative (an individual\u2019s active desire to grow in personally relevant domains), basic needs satisfaction at college, and positive outcomes in samples of students from a large, public, predominantly White institution (n\u2009=\u2009818) and a small, private, minority-majority college (n\u2009=\u2009195). Using structural equation modeling, we examined a hypothesized model in which personal growth initiative was indirectly related to the two outcomes (psychological well-being and vocational commitment) through the satisfaction of the basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness; this was compared to a reverse model. The hypothesized model was a better fit for the data in the university sample, and both models had similar fit for the college sample. Tests of indirect effects using the hypothesized model showed evidence of mediation, with similarities and differences between the samples. Finally, the two models were invariant across institutions at the structural level. PGI and basic needs satisfaction explained over half of the variance in psychological well-being and approximately one-quarter of the variance in vocational commitment in both samples.

It can be frightening to see the great unknown called \u201cyour future\u201d lying ahead in the years to come, but when college is over and done with, it\u2019s safe to say that the unsure young freshman will have matured into a completely different person.\u00a0 The only question is, what kind of growth does college bring out in students? Besides being educated for a career in your chosen field, college elects personal growth above all other things. We learn how to become people, in a sense. \u201cI\u2019d say we learn how to be a person, really,\u201d said Chenowa Wendel, a sophomore English student. \u201cWe learn how to fend for ourselves and how to help others; we learn how to have fun and how to sacrifice our fun for our responsibilities.\u201d\u00a0 Wendel, as a second year student, understands the expectations before her and the valuable lessons being at college is teaching her. The duality of her statements reflect the wide variety of lessons learned at college: you\u2019re not just learning social skills and ways to live, you\u2019re learning about compromises and sacrifices that are inevitable in life. \u201cIn a way, we learn what\u2019s important and what isn\u2019t,\u201d she added. People tend to come into their own once they\u2019re left to their own devices. At college, you\u2019re responsible for your own grades, food, and time management. The lack of a metaphorical \u201csafety net\u201d tends to bring out the best or worst in students.\u00a0 You stop being the person you were in high school for a number of reasons, because your attitude, environment, and expected behavior have all changed. This \u201creveal\u201d of your inner self is characterized by your actions in college; by seeing what you are like under the pressure of being self-reliant and self-managed, you develop into the person you will likely be for your adult life. \u201cOnce someone goes to college they meet people more like themselves, and that encourages them to be who they are and not just the \u2018mask\u2019 they hide behin",

Daniel Goleman, a recognized thought leader on emotional intelligence, defines this capacity in terms of self awareness, self regulation, motivation, and self-regulation. Regular socialization in college helps develop deep and lasting relationships, which can support students in various ways. College education can help students enhance their soft skills and develop a growth mindset, making them more valuable to potential employers. Socializing is a key area of life that students particularly try to maintain in college, as it allows them to develop deep and lasting relationships. The development of social skills has been found to boost student achievement, especially in core academic subjects. Students engage in social activities in college, having the opportunity to observe how others act in these situations. They may see behaviors they want to emulate or avoid, learning new ways to handle themselves in social situations. Research confirms that social-emotional learning (SEL) improves students\u2019 relatio",

How would you answer? Gaining good friends to \u201ctalk shop\u201d with? Easing loneliness during difficult times? Having a group\u00a0to join for Friday night fun? Indeed there are many, many benefits personal to each of us. But you may find, too, that there are certain benefits that are recognizable to all. These are highlighted\u00a0below. Form Deep and Lasting\u00a0Relationships When you socialize regularly in college, you tend to develop deep and lasting\u00a0relationships. Even if some of the connections are shorter term, they can support you in different\u00a0ways. For example, maybe a college friend in your same major is interested in starting a business with you. Or maybe a roommate helps you find a job. With a foundation of caring and concern, you are bound to find that your interdependent relationships fulfill you and others. This interdependence leads to a mutual trust and understanding that strengthens all of the people involved.\u00a0It\u2019s unlikely that students without interdependent relationships will experience these kinds of benefits. Develop Good Study Habits Study habits vary from student to student, but you can usually tell when studying and social life are at odds. Creative, organized students can combine\u00a0studying and socializing for maximum advantage. For example, you might\u00a0join a peer study group for a subject that you find difficult or even for a subject that you excel in. Either way, you and others gain from this relationship. There is mutual support not only for\u00a0studying but for building social connections. Minimize Stress When you feel stressed, what are your \u201cgo-to\u201d behaviors?

I\u2019m still working part-time and living at home to save money. I am a little shy and have had a hard time making friends in my classes. I\u2019m wondering if it\u2019s possible to make friends and develop a social life in college even when you live off-campus?\u201d Many people assume that making friends in college will be easy, but this isn\u2019t always the case. Approaching people, starting conversations, and asking people to hang out comes naturally to people who are more outgoing but can be really hard for an introvert or someone with social anxiety. Students who commute, live, or work off-campus may have a harder time building their social lives and integrating into life on campus. Making friends is an important part of the college experience. In fact, research shows that making friends in the first year makes people more likely to still be enrolled the next year and is linked to an overall more successful adjustment to college life.[1][2] Here are 10 ways to widen your social network, improve your social life, and make friends in college. 1. Prioritize your social life early on By the third week in college, most new students report having some success with meeting people and starting to make new friends, so don\u2019t put your social life on the back burner when you start college.[3] Start early by making conversation and small talk with people you see on campus, in your classes, and in your dorm. With practice, you\u2019ll become more confident around others. There are several advantages that can come from working early on in college to make new friends, including:[1][2] You will meet other new students who are eager to make friends Cliques haven\u2019t formed yet, making it easier to form groups of friends Meeting other new students can help you adju",

Positive Education 1 7 Student Engagement Strategies for Improved Learning 20 Nov 2024 by Tiffany Sauber Millacci, Ph.D. Scientifically reviewed by Alicia Nortje, Ph.D. Key Insights 12 minute read Student engagement improves academic performance, life skills, emotional wellbeing, resilience & fosters a sense of belonging. Active learning, personalized instruction, clear expectations, and an active teacher presence can boost student involvement and success. Types of engagement include behavioral, cognitive, and emotional. Just because a student is not throwing spitballs and shouting out does not guarantee that they are truly engaged in learning. Having been in education for almost two decades, I have learned that engaging students in the learning process is more than just capturing their attention. It\u2019s about inspiring curiosity, fostering a love of learning, and ensuring they are active participants in their educational journey. In today\u2019s fast-paced, technology-driven world, traditional teaching methods alone may not suffice. To truly connect with students, educators must employ dynamic strategies that cater to diverse learning styles and interests. From interactive platforms to personalized learning experiences, these strategies can transform classrooms into vibrant spaces where students not only absorb information but also collaborate, think critically, and apply knowledge in meaningful ways.

Consequently, the current study assessed relationships among personal growth initiative (an individual\u2019s active desire to grow in personally relevant domains), basic needs satisfaction at college, and positive outcomes in samples of students from a large, public, predominantly White institution (n\u2009=\u2009818) and a small, private, minority-majority college (n\u2009=\u2009195). Using structural equation modeling, we examined a hypothesized model in which personal growth initiative was indirectly related to the two outcomes (psychological well-being and vocational commitment) through the satisfaction of the basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness; this was compared to a reverse model. The hypothesized model was a better fit for the data in the university sample, and both models had similar fit for the college sample. Tests of indirect effects using the hypothesized model showed evidence of mediation, with similarities and differences between the samples. Finally, the two models were invariant across institutions at the structural level. PGI and basic needs satisfaction explained over half of the variance in psychological well-being and approximately one-quarter of the variance in vocational commitment in both samples.

                  "raw_content": "Growth and Change Through the College Years Intellectual and social stimulation from the college setting can mix with the normal developmental patterns of becoming an adult in American society to produce profound changes in young people. Most parents expect their young adult children to change when they go to college, yet some parents are not prepared for the magnitude of those changes. To tell the truth, young adults themselves are not always ready for the changes that college can produce in them either. These changes can be better understood when seen through a framework or theory of psychosocial development. One such theory was developed by Arthur Chickering in 1969 and described in his book Education and Identity. Although Chickering\u2019s theory was based upon the experiences of college students in the 1960s, this theory has stood the test of time. As a matter of fact, it was adapted and expanded to include women and African-Americans by Marilu McEwen and colleagues in 1996. The Seven Tasks of College Student Development Most often, the young adult develops along each of these seven vectors simultaneously. For some individuals, certain tasks within the developmental framework assume higher priority and must be addressed in advance of other tasks. For example, a woman may need to free herself from dependent relationships before she can clarify her purpose, set personal and career goals, and establish her own identity. More recently, McEwen and colleagues have suggested two additional vectors not part of Chickering\u2019s original theory.

Within the Jesuit tradition, there is a concept, \u201ccura personalis,\u201d which means to care for the whole person. When applied to education, this principle seeks to promote the personal development of the whole person, mentally, but also physically, ethically and, yes, spiritually. I find this idea of educating the whole person inspiring. In my view, a college education shouldn\u2019t just cultivate students\u2019 cognitive, analytic and problem-solving abilities or expand their content knowledge or merely instill the cultural literacies that we associate with a rich liberal arts education. It should nurture their development across every dimension: emotional, ethical, physical and social. Shouldn\u2019t the goal of an undergraduate education go beyond producing budding businessfolk or chemists or engineers or literary critics or manufacturing career-ready graduates? Look at any institutional mission statement or set of graduation requirements and you\u2019ll see that institutions want to help instill a sense of purpose and direction, impart ethical and cross-cultural awareness, inculcate emotional intelligence, and implant the capacity for self-reflection that we associate with a mature adult. Yet few secular institutions strive to actually achieve those objectives. I know full well the objections to such a vision. After all, its roots are religious, and in a liberal society, isn\u2019t there something intrusive and patronizing in imagining that colleges should help students mature? Then there\u2019s a more practical concern. If colleges find it hard to produce graduates who can write gracefully or crunch numbers accurately or speak a foreign language fluently, how can they realistically think that they can promote students\u2019 well-rounded development? Colleges already have gradually inflated their responsibilities beyond the purely academic at great cost and with uncertain results. Shouldn\u2019t we recognize that some tas",

John Bradley Follow Lampshade of ILLUMINATION -- Listen Share I. Introduction In the journey of life, personal growth and transformation hold paramount importance. It is through personal growth and transformation that individuals can discover their true potential, overcome obstacles, and lead fulfilling lives. One significant factor that plays a pivotal role in this process is education. Education, in its various forms, serves as a catalyst for personal development, fostering skills, knowledge, and perspectives that contribute to an individual\u2019s growth. In this article, we will explore the profound impact of education on personal growth and transformation, understanding its role as a transformative force in shaping individuals\u2019 lives. A. Importance of personal growth and transformation Personal growth and transformation are essential aspects of human existence. They involve the continuous process of self-improvement, self-reflection, and self-discovery. Engaging in personal growth enables individuals to evolve, adapt, and thrive in an ever-changing world. It allows them to broaden their horizons, develop their potential, and make meaningful contributions to society. Personal transformation, on the other hand, encompasses profound changes in an individual\u2019s beliefs, values, behaviors, and overall outlook on life. It empowers individuals to break free from limiting patterns and embrace new possibilities, leading to a more fulfilling and purposeful existence. B. Definition of education Education can be defined as the systematic process of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes through various formal and informal methods. It encompasses both structured learning within educational institutions, such as schools and universities, and lifelong learning that occurs through personal exper",

Consequently, the current study assessed relationships among personal growth initiative (an individual\u2019s active desire to grow in personally relevant domains), basic needs satisfaction at college, and positive outcomes in samples of students from a large, public, predominantly White institution (n\u2009=\u2009818) and a small, private, minority-majority college (n\u2009=\u2009195). Using structural equation modeling, we examined a hypothesized model in which personal growth initiative was indirectly related to the two outcomes (psychological well-being and vocational commitment) through the satisfaction of the basic needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness; this was compared to a reverse model. The hypothesized model was a better fit for the data in the university sample, and both models had similar fit for the college sample. Tests of indirect effects using the hypothesized model showed evidence of mediation, with similarities and differences between the samples. Finally, the two models were invariant across institutions at the structural level. PGI and basic needs satisfaction explained over half of the variance in psychological well-being and approximately one-quarter of the variance in vocational commitment in both samples.

The process by which we embed these practices within our educational system is known as social capital development. When social capital development is embedded within education-to-workforce pathways, students are better positioned to turn their academic and technical skills into good jobs, more training, and better opportunities. Unfortunately, social capital has not been a major priority within our educational system despite growing recognition that it is a critical ingredient within pathways for opening doors to good jobs. Increasingly, organizations across the country are working to embed social capital development into educational experiences, equipping students with the knowledge, skills, confidence, and opportunities to strengthen and expand relationships and networks that can help them achieve their postsecondary and career goals. To better understand the current state of social capital development efforts happening in the field, Education Strategy Group conducted a landscape scan to provide deeper insight into how national, state, and local-level education organizations are defining, and the extent to which they are incorporating, social capital development into their day-to-day work with st",

In addition to being a good student, being involved in extracurriculars, and maintaining a social life, you also have to consider that your actions now contribute to the person you are becoming. That is why personal growth activities are so important to implement now. This post is going to share the best personal development activities that you can use right now as a college student to bring you closer to your goals. While school is obviously a large part of your college experience, there are a ton of other things to consider. The majority of your college experience is learning more about yourself, setting goals (both for graduation and post-grad life), and preparing for your future. Now is the time to explore new skills, make memories, and grow in ways you never imagined. Everyone will have different needs for their personal growth activities depending on their goals. The first step in determining your goals is to\u00a0understand your core values\u00a0and have an idea of where you want to be in life. The main idea of personal growth is to help you become the best version of yourself. So start by figuring out what that looks like. 12 Best Personal Growth Activities To Do In College Now that you have determined your goals and what your core values are, here are the best personal growth activities for college students to implement. Try one or all of them to get the best results. Always remember that it is better to start slow and master one new habit before adding another. 1. Learn a new skill or hobby A new skill or hobby can always benefit your personal growth. Not only does it teach you something new, but it also allows you to find new perspectives on life. I find that the older I get, the more important it is to have hobbies. Start by finding a topic you are interested in. Then, once a week instead of watching TV for an hour, learn more about this topic. It could be anything from learning about essential oils to sta",

Abstract We investigated how learning environments\u2013involving their physical, pedagogical, and psychosocial dimensions\u2013influence students learning experiences in an Australian Faculty of Business and Economics. Qualitative data collection involved observations of eight classrooms over a semester, four focus groups with 21 students and interviews with six educators. The study provided deeper understanding of the dynamic and complex intrinsic interrelations of learning environment dimensions over time, addressing previous gaps in research. It identified and analysed spaces and practices, educational activities, and students\u2019 subjective experiences in different learning environments to illustrate how these multiple elements intersect and influence on the students\u2019 experience. The mixed methods used in the research helped to uncover a broader view of the learning environment and its interdependent influences over time on students\u2019 learning experiences.

As the world becomes more interconnected and interdependent than ever imagined, technology has generated enormous amounts of wealth, higher incomes, rapid urbanisation and reduced poverty. But it has also sharpened and intensified social inequalities and created political disruptions that threaten to tear societies apart. Technological acceleration and economic globalisation have done little to address global issues such as climate change and to impact the greater common good as represented by the United Nations\u2019 Sustainable Development Goals. Meanwhile, populist movements in several Western societies around the globe continue to divide societies with a fear of the \u2018other\u2019 and a denial of selected scientific truths. Universities push back by doing what they do best \u2013 building trust through free enquiry, ensuring that impersonal criteria are used to establish scientific facts, promoting the open communication of ideas, supporting the next generation of critical thinkers, placing value on a diversity of types of intelligence and working for the common good and growth of an enlightened public.

                  "raw_content": "Five genius inventions that grew out of UC research The sun goes behind a cloud. Winds die. Rivers slow to a trickle. But the ocean never rests. And yet, while we\u2019ve built solar panels, wind turbines and hydroelectric dams all over California to generate renewable energy, we\u2019ve done almost nothing to harness the constant churn of waves against our 840-mile coastline. \u201cWe saw that there\u2019s an enormous gap there, that we don\u2019t have the technology yet to harness all that unused wave power,\u201d says UC Berkeley alum Marcus Lehman. While earning his Ph.D. and as a visiting scholar with Prof. Reza Alam, Mechanical Engineering UC Berkeley, Lehmann designed a sturdy metal box that floats just below the ocean surface, housing generators that turns the wave\u2019s motion into usable electricity, just like a breeze turning a windmill. Wave power is more consistent and predictable than wind, solar or hydroelectric. And it\u2019s plentiful: Each year, waves on the West Coast release enough energy to power 23 million homes, equal to two-thirds of the electricity currently generated in the region. \u201cThat\u2019s the main mission for us: to unlock that enormous resource,\u201d Lehman says. With the help of the UC CITRIS Foundry and LBNL Cyclotron Road, Lehmann and his cofounders turned this research into a startup called CalWave. Today the company is building wave energy converters and offering their solution for a commercial pilot to the Mowachaht/Muchalaht First Nation in British Columbia, Canada. The community is reclaiming their ancestral land on Nootka Island off the coast of British Columbia, and CalWave\u2019s technology is harnessing the turbulent seas offshore to power a microgrid that will establish the community\u2019s energy independence. CalWave is one of over 20 innovations that originated in UC research featured at an Innovation Showcase in Sacramento earlier this month. The showcase was part of UC Day, when students, faculty, staff and alums from every UC campus head to the state capitol to meet with lawmakers. The annual event is a chance to highl",

From everyday mainstays like the world wide web and Gatorade, to pivotal innovations, inventions from higher education institutions have had a remarkable impact on human history. Many modern-day inventions that went on to change the world emerged from university research. From everyday mainstays like the world wide web and Gatorade, to pivotal innovations, such as X-ray technology, birth control pills, and the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, famous inventions from higher education institutions have had a remarkable impact on human history time and again. Despite declining government support, cutting-edge university innovation persists, thanks\u2013in part\u2013to corporate R&D spending. These renowned inventions are shining examples of the types of scientific advancement that can arise from industry-academia partnerships. 1. The Discovery of the HBV Vaccine Universities have long played a central role in global medical advancement. Higher education institutions are responsible for inventing crucial equipment and techniques, such as the MRI scanner and surgery under anesthesia.\u00a0 Among these important innovations is the Hepatitis B vaccine, which emerged from a collaboration between the University of Pennsylvania and the Fox Chase Cancer Center, one of the nation\u2019s first cancer hospitals.\u00a0 At the time, virology was still a new science. So, doctors had limited resources and methodology for dealing with HBV and other sexually transmitted diseases. In a study that altered the course of medicine, researchers Baruch Blumberg and Irving Millman found the Australia Antigen (AuAg) by gathering serum samples from across the world in the 1950s and \u201860s. The antigen was named for the population from which it was primarily discovered, the Australian aborigines, who had developed antibodies relevant to HBV prevention.\u00a0 In 1972, Blumberg and Millman\u2019s patent was granted, and their work to develop an FDA-approved vaccine in pa",

They may not be exactly what you\u2019d think.\u00a0In 2015, someone asked me what I thought about innovation in higher ed in an email, so I responded with a couple of hundred words, which I added to in creating this short blog post. Today, I\u2019m going back and updating the post with some new thinking, examples of innovation, a revised order, some links for context, and excerpts from longer papers on innovation at the university level. I thought I\u2019d share it because I haven\u2019t talked much about higher ed, but for better or for worse, it is a big part of what we do in K-12. I don\u2019t follow higher education very closely, so this is all from 20 feet away. One of the big takeaways for me is how frustratingly little innovation there has been in higher ed. If this list seems underwhelming, that\u2019s in part due to the underwhelming nature of the innovations. Also note, the point of this post isn\u2019t to showcase how innovative higher education is but rather to point out innovations that are out there as a kind of survey while also hopefully helping pollinate the possibility of innovation in the upper end of the field and \u2018industry\u2019 of education. With that in mind, I\u00a0 started out with the more common, perhaps less exciting examples. Six Common Examples Of Innovation In Higher Education 1. Competency-Based Learning Competency-Based Education is something I\u2019m hearing more and more about, which is neither bad nor good, but worth understanding more carefully.

The middle of the twentieth century saw the development of research and the strengthening of trust both within academia and between academics and external actors. Since the later part of the twentieth century, however, the development of academic research has been characterised by reduced trust in universities and academics. It is argued that the lowering degrees of trust in universities and science are reflected in the current incentives in academia, often driven by governmental funding agencies, and the result of the altered position of universities within innovation systems. Universities are still important contributors to knowledge production, but they have slowly become more peripheral within innovation systems. Rather than setting their own research directions, they face strong incentives to do research primarily to serve others. This requires them to interact with organisations with which they have little in common and with which they find it difficult to communicate. The academic research pendulum seems to have swung too much towards knowledge transfer and application, with problematic outcomes. These developments indicate that it is necessary to reassess the purposes and potential benefits of academic research to restore trust in universities and increase the integrity and usefulness of research.

The Chinese government emphasizes higher education institutions\u2019 role in forming and developing students\u2019 innovation abilities. However, few studies have explored how to improve the innovation ability of higher education students from the academic atmosphere of higher education institutions. This study examines the impact of the academic atmosphere on Chinese graduate students\u2019 innovation ability and the chain mediating effect of scientific research self-efficacy and scientific engagement. Three hundred thirteen Chinese postgraduates were investigated with the academic atmosphere scale, scientific research self-efficacy scale, scientific engagement scale, and innovation ability scale. The bootstrap method was used to test the mediating effect. The results show that (1) there is a significant positive correlation between the academic atmosphere and the innovation ability of graduate students, (2) scientific research self-efficacy and scientific engagement play a mediating role between the academic atmosphere and graduate students\u2019 innovation ability, and (3) the mediating role includes three paths: the mediating role of scientific research self-efficacy, the mediating role of scientific engagement, and the chain mediating role of scientific research self-efficacy and scientific engagement.

BU.S. Universities and Industrial Innovation: An Interactive Relationship Producing Economic Value from Research1 HOW ACADEMIC RESEARCH INFLUENCES INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION The relationship between academic research and industrial innovation is a topic of great interest to policy makers and has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years. Although this relationship often is (mis)conceptualized as one in which \u201cacademia invents and industry invests\u201d in commercialization, in fact the relationship may be better understood as an interactive one that is supported by flows of ideas and people from universities to industry and vice versa. Indeed, industrial research may lead and influence the agenda of academic research in some fields, as was the case in the early stages of research on light-emitting diodes (LEDs) and semiconductors (Mowery, 2011). According to L\u00e9cuyer (2005), Provost Frederick Terman of Stanford University encouraged William Shockley to locate his new firm near the university in 1955 to expose Stanford's engineering faculty to new research in solid-state physics and electronics, and a future dean",

As society advances, it is these entrepreneurial pursuits, fueled by innovative ideas, that bring about impactful change. The crucial role of universities in this ecosystem is undeniable. They serve as the birthplace of pioneering ideas and are equipped to prepare the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. While universities have traditionally been recognized for their commitment to education and research, their role has significantly expanded in the 21st century. They are now viewed as catalysts for economic development, hubs for innovation, and incubators of entrepreneurship. Indeed, universities have emerged as key players in the global innovation ecosystem, acting as a bridge between academic theory and real-world application. Universities are often home to diverse talent, avant-garde ideas, and a wealth of resources - a combination that is conducive to a vibrant entrepreneurial environment. The exposure to a broad range of disciplines and ideas allows students to cultivate a multidisciplinary approach to problem-solving, a skill that is invaluable in the entrepreneurial journey. Furthermore, universities can nurture a culture of entrepreneurship by integrating it into their curriculum.

By producing new knowledge and exposing students to that knowledge, they not only generate new ideas but prepare knowledgeable, inventive, and motivated graduates who can carry those ideas into businesses, nongovernmental organizations, and governments. In addition, faculty members sometimes play a direct role by consulting with existing companies or even starting their own companies.

Universities, through their basic, use-inspired and applied research, and their varied knowledge exchange activities with partners generate and diffuse new ideas, technologies and approaches that not only have the potential to lead to ground-breaking innovations that transform the world but also help to deliver important incremental innovations that help to drive efficiency and productivity improvements.\u00a0 Through their research, universities also contribute to innovation well beyond driving technological advances. For example, research helps to drive: new business models and organisational practices to create and capture value; new ways of producing and supplying products and services in more efficient and sustainable ways; insights on how individuals and populations behave, respond and adapt to new technologies; and public policies, standards and regulations, and ethics frameworks that guide the development and diffusion of innovations.",

Fallon Farnam Jahanian President, Carnegie Mellon University This article is part of: World Economic Forum Annual Meeting The digital revolution is not only here, it is accelerating every day. Advances in automation, the digitisation of information, unprecedented access to data and the democratisation of knowledge are transforming every sector of our economy \u2013 from healthcare to transportation to energy and beyond. The scope, scale, and ubiquity of these disruptions is truly unprecedented. According to data from a recent McKinsey study, a dozen technologies, including genomics, energy storage, and automation, will drive major economic and societal transformation in the next several years. With a potential economic impact between $14 trillion and $33 trillion a year in 2025, the value of these emerging technologies could constitute one third of global GDP. As we embrace this tech-driven economy, universities must change, too, at a pace unfamiliar to higher education. While we retain our core mission of educating the next generation and cultivating new forms of knowledge, universities must also embrace our ever-expanding role in driving innovation and catalysing economic development. Our institutions must meet the challenges of the digital revolution head on, and play an increasingly important role in our innovation ecosystems and economies in four key ways. 1. Fostering entrepreneurship As the pace of discovery accelerates and global competition intensifies, universities are embracing entrepreneurship as part of the academic experience, creating cultures where innovative thinking is inspired and nurtured.

While most studies have examined the antecedents of spin-off creation at universities, the impact of spin-offs commercializing university research cannot be properly assessed without considering how these firms develop, grow, and perform over time. This study provides a systematic review of a recent research stream addressing the development, growth, and performance of university spin-offs. By critically analyzing 105 research papers published since 2000, this paper makes two main contributions. First, we present a conceptual framework outlining the variety of outcomes used in the literature to assess the development, growth and performance of university spin-offs, as well as the determinants of these outcomes at different levels of analysis. Second, we critically assess gaps in the extant literature and discuss promising directions for future research. We conclude that the university spin-off phenomenon provides an excellent empirical context for conducting research that contributes to more general theoretical discussions related to entrepreneurship, innovation and management.

However, there is a limited body of research that specifically explores the impact of university-industry collaborations on the performance creation of these spinoffs. This study aims to fill this gap by examining the effects of university-industry collaborations on the creation of Spin-Offs from two perspectives: the number of university collaborations with different companies and the number of previous collaborations between the same university-industry dyad. The research employs joint patents as a source to measure the university-industry collaborations and statistical methods to empirically examine the impact of these collaborations on Spin-Off creation. The study is based on data from 108 universities between the years 2014 and 2017. The findings of this study reveal that both the number of collaborations and specially the presence of previous collaborations between the university and industry have a positive effect on the creation of Spin-Offs. These results suggest that universities and companies should consider these findings when formulating their strategies or policies for technology transfer and innovation management by encouraging university-industry collaborations.

Their contributions to technological and scientific knowledge development have been supported by various types of funding. The current study investigates the impacts of two academic research funding sources\u2014industry and competitive\u2014on academic patents. We measure the effects with two indicators\u2014creation of progenitor inventions and the degree of diffusion. Using a patent database, this paper identifies a progenitor invention if a patent is granted without any backward citations and measures the degree of diffusion with patent citations. Focusing on Japanese university patents, the main finding of this paper is that competitive funding tends to produce progenitor inventions whereas industry funding is not likely to do so. By contrast, inventions produced from competitive funding are not likely to diffuse, whereas those produced from industry funding are likely to diffuse. Based on our findings, we argue that the competitive funding may work better when diffusion mechanism is introduced. An example is to increase academic researchers\u2019 proximity to the industry. Additionally, our findings also imply that when setting new funding or changing academic funding system such as replacing block funding with other types, it is important to understand what kind of outcomes are expected from the funding method.

Here\u2019s why \u2013 and how Oct 14, 2020 Image:\u00a0REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko Mark Dodgson David Gann Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Development and External Affairs, University of Oxford There are growing concerns over a slowdown in entrepreneurial activity at the world's universities. Entrepreneurship must be encouraged and facilitated, however \u2013 and students are increasingly demanding that this is so. Here's why this is so important, and how universities can get this vital area back on track. Fast-growth entrepreneurial ventures are essential for prosperity and social progress. Entrepreneurs create value by seizing opportunities, assuming risks, solving problems and taking action. They take risks in creating and commercialising innovative technologies in ways that larger businesses are unable to. Sometimes these technologies open completely new markets, transforming industries. Tesla is a good example. Small businesses can be agile early movers in adapting to new trends and responding to crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. They can pivot quickly to take advantage of opportunities or when their growth is slowing. Their early years of rapid growth can provide excellent returns to venture capital and the capital markets. Zoom is a good example. But there are growing concerns of a possible steep downturn in the development of ideas which feed the early stages of new business formation. Changes in the university sector caused by the pandemic and geopolitical tensions reshaping the global economy lie at the heart of these worries. Universities play a crucial role in underpinning innovation and entrepreneurial activities. They provide the conditions, facilities and talent that foster the emergence of breakthrough ideas. Many have systems in place to support the development of new ideas so that they have practical use. They play an important part in maintaining the deal flow that gives opport",

Encouraging entrepreneurship on campuses through incubators, mentorship, and real-world projects equips students with the skills and support needed to create innovative startups and drive economic growth. Universities play a key role by fostering creativity and providing resources to nurture the entrepreneurial mindset amongst students.\r Listen to Story Today, when the market dynamics are changing so fast, we don\u2019t just need jobseekers, we also need job creators. While accelerated change has brought forth challenges, it has also presented us with opportunities. An entrepreneurial spirit can act as the much-needed force presenting innovative solutions and contributing to the economic growth of our country. Recognising this, the Indian government has introduced significant initiatives like Make in India and Startup India to create an ecosystem that fosters entrepreneurship. Encouraged by the positive environment, India has emerged as a dominant force globally with more than 1,12,718 startups recognised by DPIIT, making us the third-largest startup ecosystem after the US and China. Professor Prakash Gopalan, President, NIIT University has shared insights on encouraging innovation and startups on campus. To keep up the momentum, universities and colleges should foster an entrepreneurial spirit, by providing students with platforms to explore their creativity, develop practical skills, and encourage them to set up their own ventures. As technology is advancing and industries are constantly evolving, young people are moving away from the traditional career path. By nurturing an entrepreneurial mindset, universities can help students attain the skills and attitude they need to adapt to change, take risks, and create their own opportunities. Universities will play a significant role in fostering creativity, ambition, and a risk-taking spirit by providing resources, support, and a conducive atmosphere for students. ON-CAMPUS INCUBATORS ",

You can also search for this author in PubMed \u00a0Google Scholar From the Internet to CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene editing, many seeds of progress were planted initially in the ivory tower of academia. Could research be doing even more for society? I argue that it could \u2014 if universities used artificial intelligence (AI) tools to maximize the impact of their scientists\u2019 outputs. Each year, millions of grant proposals, preprints and research papers are produced, along with patents, clinical trials and drug approvals. Massive data sets storing details of these outputs can be scoured by AI algorithms to better understand how science and technology progress and to identify gaps and bottlenecks that hinder breakthroughs. Over the past few years, my colleague and close collaborator Ben Jones, my team and I have been working with large US universities to maximize their research impacts. We\u2019ve already learnt a lot.

Technology transfer is the transmittal of developed ideas, products, or techniques from a research environment to one of practical application, and thus is an important component of rehabilitation science and engineering. By disseminating the knowledge and products that researchers have developed, their science attracts more attention and success and has value to society by improving the health and quality of life of those who ultimately benefit from the knowledge. No topic is likely the focus of more discussion but less productive action than technology transfer. The reason is simple: technology transfer is difficult and problematic. Rogers (1983, p. 1), in Diffusion of Innovations, says, ''One reason why there is so much interest in the diffusion of innovations is because getting a new idea adopted, even when it has obvious advantages, is often very difficult.\" In the context of governmental agency support for research, the idea of technology transfer usually means moving the results of government-",

INTRODUCTION Financial and social returns on scientific investments have not been realized in the general population and especially among communities that have been economically and/or socially marginalized. 1 Science fails to make a real\u2010world impact on health without adequate investment in implementation science and community\u2010engaged research. Implementation science, or the study of strategies that promote uptake of research into the real world, 2 must be coupled with an active and ongoing partnership with communities affected by the studied issues, so that scientific results are meaningful and used by the broader population. 3 Health care organizations, payers, policy makers, communities, and research funders need to embrace both implementation science and community\u2010engaged research methods to identify, evaluate, and sustain the most impactful programs and policies that improve population health and reduce disparities rapidly and effectively.

Yet, despite ambitious goals and increased technology investments, the path forward seems unclear. Challenges keep surfacing: legacy IT systems that can\u2019t keep up, faculty reluctant to adopt new teaching tools, and concerns over cybersecurity. Sound familiar? For universities, digital transformation isn\u2019t just a buzzword\u2014it\u2019s a necessity. In a rapidly evolving educational landscape, where hybrid learning and personalized education are becoming the norm, institutions must adapt or risk falling behind. However, embarking on this transformation is easier said than done. From legacy infrastructure to budget constraints, universities face unique hurdles that require careful planning and innovative solutions. In this post, we\u2019ll dive deep into the key challenges that universities encounter during their digital transformation journeys and explore practical strategies for overcoming them.

May 29, 2015 Gavin Moodie Adjunct professor, RMIT Universities have a vast array of measures to gauge how successful they are. Most of the measures have a lot to do with prestige and not much to do with the outcomes of their graduates or the quality of the education their students receive. Cut-off scores Probably the most pervasive measure of universities\u2019 success in Australia and in many other countries is their selectivity of undergraduate student entry, measured in Australia by cut-off scores. A program\u2019s cut-off score is the lowest score needed to gain entry to the program. Cut-off scores are not a good indicator of the quality or even of the prior attainment of entering students because most students have a score above the cut-off. Often programs with a cut-off score around 60, for example, admit most students with a score above 80. A far better measure of the attainment of students entering a program, inasmuch as it is a good measure of anything, is the median or middle entry score of students. Nonetheless, cut-off scores are widely viewed as an indicator of a program and university\u2019s quality by students, parents, schools, governments, members of the public and even by university staff who should know better. A good example is NSW Education Minister Adrian Piccoli and the Group of Eight elite universities who sought to require minimum entry scores for admission to teacher education programs or to all higher education bachelor programs. Student surveys Australia, with many other countries, relies heavily on student surveys to evaluate universities\u2019 performance. The course experience questionnaire is administered to graduates some four months after they complete their program. It has been rigorously evaluated and several studies have refuted the common criticisms that it favours shallow teachers or soft markers.

Elizabeth M Lawrence Direct correspondence to: Elizabeth Lawrence, 206 W. Franklin Street, Rm. 271 Chapel Hill, NC 27516; lizlaw@unc.edu Issue date 2017. Abstract College graduates live much healthier lives than those with less education, but research has yet to document with certainty the sources of this disparity. This study examines why U.S. young adults who earn college degrees exhibit healthier behavior than those with less education. I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which offers information on education and health behaviors across adolescence and young adulthood (N=14,265). Accounting for selection into college degree attainment substantially reduces the associations between college degree attainment and health behavior, but college degree attainment demonstrates a strong causal effect on young adult health. Financial, occupational, social, cognitive, and psychological resources explain less than half of the association between college degree attainment and health behavior. The healthier behaviors of college graduates are the result of sorting into educational attainment, embedding of human capital, and mechanisms other than socioeconomic and psychosocial resources. Introduction Health behaviors have clear practical and policy importance as a topic of study because they contribute so importantly to health and mortality risk in the United States. Understanding population health and personal well-being requires understanding of health behaviors. Epidemiologic calculations ",

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK The Education Effect on Population Health: A Reassessment David P Baker Juan Leon Emily G Smith Greenaway John Collins Marcela Movit Within the demographic literature are numerous reports of consistent and significant associations between formal educational attainment and individual health outcomes and risks such as mortality, smoking, drug abuse, and accidents, as well as the contraction of many diseases. The vast majority of these reports conclude that more highly educated individuals are healthier and live longer.1 This association is so prevalent that after an extensive survey of the health literature, Mirowsky and Ross (2003, p. 6) conclude, \u201ceducation has an enduring, consistent, and growing effect on health.\u201d Macro demographic and development studies also identify a significant positive association between expanding mass education and population health; yet many, especially the earliest ones, did not control for other factors, such as economic development, that may also be linked to better health (see review by Feinstein 1993). As a consequence, it is frequently suggested that the association between expanding education and population health is spurious because of the impact of general social development (e.g., economic growth, quality of health care) on both. Thus, related factors of modernity are often assumed to pave the way for both mass education and healthier populations (e.g., Bloom 2007). Social epidemiological research also reports extensive negative associations between education and disease, often after statistically controlling for indicators of socioeconomic status (e.g., Mackenbach et al. 2008; ",

The discussion that followed was moderated by Joshua Sharfstein, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (Highlights of this session are presented in Box 2-1.) Key Points Made by Steven Woolf. FACTORS THAT SHAPE HEALTH OUTCOMES Woolf outlined five domains from the report U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health (NRC and IOM, 2013) that are important to shaping health outcomes. These include health care and public health (which, he noted, account for only 10\u201320 percent of health outcomes); individual behaviors; the physical and social environment; social and economic factors (including education); and public policies and spending, which shape the other four domains (see Figure 2-1).

Previous analyses relate these improvements primarily to medical innovations and advances in health-related behaviors. Mostly ignored, however, is the question to what extent the gains in life expectancy are related to structural changes in the populations due to increasing education levels. We decompose changes of the total populations\u2019 life expectancy at age 30 in Italy, Denmark, and the USA, over the 20-year period between 1990 and 2010 into the effects of education-specific mortality changes (\u201cM effect\u201d) and changes in the populations\u2019 educational structure (\u201cP effect\u201d). We use the \u201creplacement decomposition technique\u201d to further subdivide the M effect into the contributions by the individual education groups. While most of the increases in life expectancy are due to the effect of changing mortality, a large proportion of improvements in longevity can indeed be attributed to the changing structure of the population by level of education in all three countries. The estimated contribution of the P effect ranges from around 15% for men in the USA to approximately 40% for women in Denmark. This study demonstrates strong associations between education and overall population health, suggesting that education policies can also be seen as indirect health policies. Introduction Reductions in mortality which started in Europe in the middle of the eighteenth century have continued to spread globally and led to huge increases in life expectancy, with industrialized countries being most advanced in this process.

The aim of our study was to estimate the reduction in all-cause adult mortality associated with each year of schooling at a global level. Methods In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we assessed the effect of education on all-cause adult mortality. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, Global Health (CAB), EconLit, and Sociology Source Ultimate databases from Jan 1, 1980, to May 31, 2023. Reviewers (LD, TM, HDV, CW, IG, AG, CD, DS, KB, KE, and AA) assessed each record for individual-level data on educational attainment and mortality. Data were extracted by a single reviewer into a standard template from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. We excluded studies that relied on case-crossover or ecological study designs to reduce the risk of bias from unlinked data and studies that did not report key measures of interest (all-cause adult mortality). Mixed-effects meta-regression models were implemented to address heterogeneity in referent and exposure measures among studies and to adjust for study-level covariates. This study was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183923). Findings 17\u2009094 unique records were identified, 603 of which were eligible for analysis and included data from 70 locations in 59 countries, producing a final dataset of 10\u2009355 observations.

The Relationship between Adults Education Level and Their Mental Health Status Kelsey Bergan Bethel University \u2013 PSY230M Introduction \u2022 Research has shown that those with a higher education are more likely to seek out sources to help them with mental disorders (Ibrahim, et al., 2019; Neimeyer, et al., 2011). \u2022 Previous studies have found that students with a lower GPA show signs of depression, anxiety and eating disorders (Eisenberg, Globerstein & Hunt, 2009). \u2022 There is a gap in investigating the relationship between education level and an adult\u2019s mental health experiences. \u2022 This study will provide insight to the relationship between an adults education level and their mental health. Methodology \u2022 Sample: Add Health Wave IV: 5,114 participants between 25 and 34; 62% White, 23% Black, 5% multiracial, 3% Asian/Pacific Islander, 1% Indian or Native American, 6% Other \u2022 Information was gathered from a group of adolescents (12-21) and when they were in adulthood (25-34). \u2022 Procedure: 90 minute computer assisted interview Is there a relationship between reaching desired level of education and developing signs of depression and does this rela",

Elizabeth M Lawrence Direct correspondence to: Elizabeth Lawrence, 206 W. Franklin Street, Rm. 271 Chapel Hill, NC 27516; lizlaw@unc.edu Issue date 2017. Abstract College graduates live much healthier lives than those with less education, but research has yet to document with certainty the sources of this disparity. This study examines why U.S. young adults who earn college degrees exhibit healthier behavior than those with less education. I use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health), which offers information on education and health behaviors across adolescence and young adulthood (N=14,265). Accounting for selection into college degree attainment substantially reduces the associations between college degree attainment and health behavior, but college degree attainment demonstrates a strong causal effect on young adult health. Financial, occupational, social, cognitive, and psychological resources explain less than half of the association between college degree attainment and health behavior. The healthier behaviors of college graduates are the result of sorting into educational attainment, embedding of human capital, and mechanisms other than socioeconomic and psychosocial resources. Introduction Health behaviors have clear practical and policy importance as a topic of study because they contribute so importantly to health and mortality risk in the United States. Understanding population health and personal well-being requires understanding of health behaviors. Epidemiologic calculations ",

According to a study from the University of Notre Dame, college graduates experience long-term health effects not seen in non-college grads. The study, titled \u201cThe Effect of College Education on Health,\u201d is part of the National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series. Notre Dame Economists Kasey Buckles, Abigail Wozniak and Andreas Hagemann, together with Melinda Sandler Morrill from North Carolina State University and Ofer Malamud from the University of Chicago, examined the completion of college on adult mortality and found a 28 percent reduction in early mortality for college graduates. Using variation in college completion induced by draft-avoidance during the Vietnam War, the researchers were able to identify the effect of increased higher education on the later health status of men who were eligible to be drafted into the war. They focused on the cumulative mortality rate between 1981 and 2007, taking into account factors such as better health insurance and higher wages enjoyed by college graduates, as well as the relationship between college completion and various health behaviors such as smoking, exercise and obesity. Much of the decrease in mortality was driven by fewer deaths from cancer and heart disease.

Issue date 2018 Apr 1. Abstract Adults with higher educational attainment live healthier and longer lives compared to their less educated peers. The disparities are large and widening. We posit that understanding the educational and macro-level contexts in which this association occurs is key to reducing health disparities and improving population health. In this paper, we briefly review and critically assess the current state of research on the relationship between education and health in the United States. We then outline three directions for further research: We extend the conceptualization of education beyond attainment and demonstrate the centrality of the schooling process to health; We highlight the dual role of education a driver of opportunity but also a reproducer of inequality; We explain the central role of specific historical socio-political contexts in which the education-health association is embedded. This research agenda can inform policies and effective interventions to reduce health disparities and improve health of all Americans.

Dewar Show more Add to Mendeley Share Cite https://doi.org/10.1016/S0272-7757(97)00034-4Get rights and content Abstract Inequalities in the availability of employer-based health insurance due to differences in formal educational attainment are examined. 7762 fully employed adult respondents are sampled from the 1987 National Medical Expenditure Survey. Respondents are classed as covered by employer, sponsored or individually purchased insurance or uninsured. Probit regression is used to predict the likelihood of employer sponsored health insurance. Fully employed persons with higher levels of formal education are more likely to have insurance. The likelihood of employer sponsored coverage is determined more strongly by industrial classes rather than the result of educational attainment alone. Based on the impact of employment and premium share on insurance type, incentives for the development of employee insurance purchasing cooperatives and premium subsidies may be feasible in increasing access to affordable health insurance. These policies may help alleviate detrimental effects to health status by reducing the negative fringe benefit effects of occupational selection. [JEL I1; J31; J33] Introduction Economists have noted that there is a direct association between formal educational attainment and returns from employment. Specifically, the age\u2013earnings profiles for workers with more formal education are steeper than the profiles of workers with less education (Ehrenberg and Smith, 1982). However, recent evidence has shown that employment compensation has a more complex association with education and other soc",

It can protect against the following circumstances: receiving less medical care, difficulty finding care in a timely fashion, having worse health outcomes, and financial burden (Urban Institute). Overall, health insurance can aid in protecting the health and financial future of an individual or family for a lifetime. It provides citizens with an affordable way to get the medical care that is needed. However, health insurance is not affordable for everyone and the cost of health insurance is in fact rising. There are many reasons that health insurance attainment is difficult for some and one of those reasons is education. I obtained data, from healthcare.gov, listing the percentage of uninsured residents in each state broken down by education level over a three year period (2009-2012). I used GIS to create four maps depicting this data which shows as education level increases the percentage of uninsured citizens decreases. Results: To show the effect of higher education on insurance attainment, the same legend scale was used for each graph. Figure 1 displays the percentage of uninsured citizens in each state who have not graduated from high school. As can be seen in Figure 1, the majority of states have 25-50 percent of uninsured citizens. Figure 2 displays the percentage of uninsured citizens in each state who have a high school diploma. As can be seen in Figure 2, the majority of states have 15-25 percent of uninsured citizens. Figure 3 displays the percentage of uninsured citizens in each state who have some colleg",

Research shows that college graduates live nearly a decade longer than those without a high school diploma, and they\u2019re 24% more likely to exercise regularly. You\u2019ll find that higher education shields you from economic stress while improving your health-related choices, from nutrition to smoking habits. Better educated individuals experience lower rates of chronic illnesses, better mental wellness, and make more informed healthcare decisions. If you\u2019re curious about the powerful connection between education and health, there\u2019s much more to learn about this life-changing relationship. Understanding Education\u2019s Impact on Longevity While many factors influence how long we live, education stands out as a powerful predictor of longevity. Research shows that higher education can reduce mortality rates by an astounding 93% when comparing those with 17+ years of education to those with 11 or fewer years. You\u2019ll find that educational attainment impacts your health in multiple ways. If you\u2019ve completed more years of education, you\u2019re less likely to die from preventable causes like lung cancer, respiratory diseases, accidents, and homicide. This connection between education and life expectancy has grown stronger over time, with the mortality gap between the most and least educated Americans widening notably since 1990. Your level of education also shields you from economic hardship, which directly affects both your physical health and psychological health. When you\u2019re better educated, you\u2019re less exposed to financial stressors that can lead to serious health complications. The evidence is clear: investing in your education isn\u2019t just about career prospects \u2013 it\u2019s a vital investment in your longevity. As educational levels have risen across the U.S., the impact of education on mortality rates has become even more pronounced. Better educated individuals tend to make healthier food choic",

Lam Quynh Vo, Outreach and Communications Fellow We all recognize that a good education is important for a good career and stable life. However, less recognized is the impact of education on health outcomes. Americans with more education live longer, healthier lives than those with fewer years of schooling\u2014and this has never been more true than today. Did you know that in the last few decades, the life expectancy gap between the most and least educated Americans has been widening? Or that Americans with less education are now, more than ever, more likely to have serious health conditions such as diabetes and heart disease? In the health equity sphere, education is classified as one of the so-called \u201csocial determinants of health\u201d\u2014conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work and age that shape health outcomes. This blog will give you a small glimpse of the multifaceted and interconnected ways in which education and health impact each other. Source\u00a0 1) Education can create better opportunities to health In today\u2019s job market, a highly educated applicant is more likely to be employed in a position that provides health-promoting benefits such as health insurance, paid leave and retirement. People with less education, on the other hand, are more likely to work in low-wage or higher-risk occupations with fewer benefits. High educational attainment tends to lead to higher income as well, which in turn has a positive effect on health: high-income families have time to exercise more regularly, and can afford to pay for healthier food, health care and transportation to health services. Given the high cost of health care, low-income families are often forced to choose between paying for health insurance and care, groceries, or rent. And speaking of rent, low-income individuals face higher risk of poor housing and housing insecurity, which is often connected to worse health outcomes. Through income, education is connected to many other social determinants as well, such as ",

Partners University of Melbourne provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation AU. View all partners It is recognised that healthy habits account for large differences in health outcomes. Unhealthy behaviour has been cited as the main predictor of premature and preventable disease. But this raises an important, policy-related question. Why do some people invest more in a healthy lifestyle than others? Health economists argue that better educated people are more likely to choose healthier lifestyles. This is in part because future returns for healthy behaviour (in terms of both health and lifetime earnings) are higher for the better educated, thus leading them to invest more in a healthy lifestyle. People of higher educational background are on average less likely to smoke, abuse alcohol, and will exercise more, eat healthier foods, and have more frequent health checks than the average population. This can be explained by a variety of different reasons. For instance, students with healthier lifestyles may be more efficient in acquiring knowledge so they tend to perform well in their education. One could also imagine that people who value future consumptions more than current consumption will stay in school for longer, work more at younger ages and invest more in positive health-related behaviours. New research in the area Most of the existing evidence cannot truly separate the true effect of education itself on health habits from other confounding factors as mentioned above. My colleague and I have recently conducted research to address this important question. We used an econometric technique to empirically identify the causal effect of education on a range of ",

Accepted 2020 Dec 15; Issue date 2021 Apr. Abstract Understanding the effect of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on students\u2019 health and financial stability is important to establish effective interventions to mitigate these effects, which may have long-term consequences on their health and well-being. Public universities in urban centers represent a substantial proportion of college students in the USA. We implemented a cross-sectional population-based online survey of 2282 students in a large, public university in New York City in April 2020. We created weights to account for non-response and used Poisson regression with robust standard errors to estimate adjusted prevalence ratios (aPR) for factors associated with mental health outcomes. Students experienced high rates of anxiety/depression and financial instability due to the pandemic. Half of the students reported anxiety/depression (54.5%) and an increased need for mental health services (49.0%) as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The majority (81.1%) reported loss of household income, and half (49.8%) reported worries about losing housing. High levels of food (aPR\u00a0\u2009=\u00a01.4, 95% CI 1.2, 1.6) and housing (aPR\u2009=\u20091.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.4) insecurity were the strongest predictors of anxiety/depression.

Abstract Background Lowered mental wellbeing of students is a growing health and societal problem. Experiencing high levels of stress for a longer period of time has been associated with an increased risk for lower mental wellbeing and mental health problems. To reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing it is important to understand how various sources of stress are related with mental wellbeing and which factors can buffer the impact of stress on mental wellbeing. Objectives Deriving from a conceptual model the aim of the study was to explore 1) the association of underlying stressors (academic pressure, family circumstances, side-activity pressure, and financial situation) with perceived stress and mental wellbeing, 2) whether perceived stress mediates the association between the sources of stress and mental wellbeing and 3) whether loneliness, self-esteem, personality and coping styles buffer or reinforce the impact of perceived stress on mental wellbeing.

Academic life exposes college students to multiple adjustments, demands, and vulnerabilities that can cause stress and mental health problems. This study aims to identify psychological well-being and psychological distress effects on college students\u2019 mental health. Methods: A correlational study was designed involving a non-probabilistic 560 sample of students (446 women) aged 18 to 41 years (M = 19.6; SD = 1.68). An online self-report questionnaire was used including demographic, relational, academic, and health behaviors variables, and the measures: Mental Health Inventory; Satisfaction with Social Support Scale; Academic Life Satisfaction Scale; and Psychological Vulnerability Scale. Results: Regression analyses indicate that male students, dating, good academic performance, exercise, sleeping seven hours, satisfaction with social support, and academic life satisfaction were significant correlates (p < 0.05) of psychological well-bei",

Whether you\u2019re going for your AA, BA, AS, BS or an industry-specific license, you\u2019re doing a lot more than just hitting the books. You\u2019re making big, hard decisions, stepping out of your comfort zone, embracing new challenges and \u2014 at least sometimes \u2014 making mistakes. Cleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center. Advertising on our site helps support our mission. We do not endorse non-Cleveland Clinic products or services. Policy That\u2019s a lot of growth and change for one person to handle. And the stress can be overwhelming at times, for sure. So, how are you supposed to tell the difference between pressure that\u2019s productive and pressure that\u2019s destructive? How do you tell when you\u2019ve crossed the threshold into mental illness? Psychologist Susan Albers, PsyD,\u00a0explains why there\u2019s a mental health crisis in higher education \u2014 and what to do if you or somebody you love is struggling. How extreme is the mental health crisis in college students? While the word \u201ccrisis\u201d sometimes gets overused, Dr. Albers believes it\u2019s accurate in the case of mental health in higher education. And the data suggests she\u2019s right. Gallup and the Lumina Foundation released the results of their 2023 State of Higher Education report in March. Many of us expected that the easing of COVID-19 restrictions in 2022 would have a positive impact on data around enrollment and retention. But that\u2019s proven not to be true. In fact, students are more likely to consider \u201cstopping out\u201d of a certificate or degree program now than they were in 2020 and 2021. Forty-one percent of students currently enrolled in a degree or certificate program described staying enrolled as \u201cdifficult\u201d or \u201cvery difficult.\u201d That answer is slightly more common for Black, Hispanic and Asian students than for white students. It was also slightly more common for male-identifying students to report s",

                  "raw_content": " Traditional Economic Impact Analysis of Universities One way to conceptualize the local economic impact of a university is to focus on the contributions the university makes to the productive capacity of the local economy (the \u201csupply side\u201d). A university provides educated and skilled labor to the local workforce and contributes to the knowledge and technology of local businesses through faculty research and consulting. An alternative way a university impacts the local economy is through its operating expenditures (the \u201cdemand side\u201d). The operations of a university require expenditures for a variety of goods and services\u2014from equipment purchases to building maintenance to meals for students. Universities are themselves large employers of faculty and staff. This directly contributes to local employment and income, and it does so indirectly when university employees spend a portion of their incomes on locally produced goods and services. Universities also bring in students and visitors from outside the local area who then also purchase goods and services. In a traditional economic impact analysis of a university, an attempt is made to measure the effects of all these university and university-related expenditures on local employment and income. Estimates of the impacts of a university on the local economy are not limited to the direct jobs and incomes provided by the university or the jobs and incomes supported among first-tier suppliers of goods and services to the university, its employees, and students. The estimated impacts also include so-called multiplier effects that arise when first-tier suppliers place upstream demands on other producers, when workers directly or indirectly associated with business operations spend a portion of their incomes in the local economy, and when state and local governments spend new tax revenues. Estimates of multiplier effects are made using an \u201cinput-output\u201d model\u2014a system of linear equations that describes the interindustry relationships in an economy.

View all partners Education helps us share knowledge, develop understanding, and supports our connection with each other. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, governments have been preoccupied with how to re-open schools. However, there has been more doubt about universities. Discussions about the rise in COVID-19 infections in student populations have often raised the question as to why students are at university at all, running risks for themselves and local populations. These questions often link with views of universities as expensive, elitist \u2013 and perhaps not worth it at all. Together with colleagues, I have conducted research commissioned by the British Council to assess the value provided by higher education. We reviewed 170 research studies published since 2010 on the contribution universities make to societies. Our survey showed that the value of universities lies not just in the education they provided to students, but in a host of other additional areas. These include expanding the economy, supporting democracy, and advancing equality and sustainability. The role of universities We looked in particular at low and lower middle income countries, with a gross national income of below US$4,125 (\u00a33,178) per person. Our research sought to assess the economic, social and political benefits \u2013 or disadvantages \u2013 universities and other other forms of tertiary education brought to these societies. The studies we reviewed explored how universities improve knowledge and skills, and how they contribute to economic development and support innovation. They in",

With the fall school semester already underway, the focus of this article is devoted to the significance of community engagement. I have been fortunate throughout my career serving the community in multiple ways, both as a university professor and a nonprofit consultant and executive leader. Here are my thoughts and experiences on community engagement. Community engagement refers to the active involvement and collaboration between a university and the surrounding community. It goes beyond traditional academic activities and involves establishing meaningful relationships, partnerships, and interactions with community centers, Ys, JCCs and various other local institutions. Community engagement aims to address community needs, promote social and economic development, and foster a sense of shared responsibility and mutual benefit. It involves listening to and valuing the perspectives and expertise of community leaders and works to create positi",

Xiuli Guo outlines how Created in partnership with Created in partnership with You may also like Popular resources Universities play a pivotal role within their local communities. Multiple studies have found a correlation between the presence of a university in a large town or city and socio-economic development in the local area. They are key drivers of social, technological and economic innovation. With that fact comes one simple question: how do we make sure the impact upon a region is long-lasting and fit for purpose? There is not a one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it requires a nuanced exploration of potential avenues through which universities can enhance their community impact. Partner with the local community Initiate and nurture collaborative partnerships between universities and local stakeholders. This involves forging alliances with community organisations, governmental entities, businesses, schools, community groups and charitable organisations. Collaborations like these are instrumental in addressing shared objectives and challenges, pooling resources and leveraging collective expertise. By fostering these partnerships, universities and local communities can establish a dynamic platform for exchanging knowledge, resources and skills. These partnerships can help amplify the impact of initiatives, leading to more effective and sustainable development. For example, many universities participate in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), getting involved in successful collaborations with businesses. These play a pivotal role in facilitating innovation for growth and create a positive impact on both the business landscape and the community at large. Universities also play a key role in bridging the gap between academia and industry by off",

Each institution and each place is different, so there is no one-size-fits-all approach, but some common themes for consideration include: Clarity of vision and strategy \u2013 Most universities undertake some kind of civic engagement, but embedding a holistic approach requires a\u00a0clear vision and strategy, underpinned by shared values and senior strategic leadership. As well as setting out a strategy, it is important that there is a clear delivery plan that explains what, why and how activity will make a difference. Critically, the strategy needs to set out the inter-relationship between civic engagement activity and the educational and research aims of the university. The way universities operate as large employers and anchor institutions also has a huge impact on local communities, so operational policies, such as social value procurement, Real Living Wage accreditation, Net Zero plans and support for volunteering all play a\u00a0part. They can also have a positive impact for our own staff and students.

Community development is a dynamic, comprehensive process aimed at improving the overall quality of life within a community. This includes enhancing economic opportunities and enriching social and recreational activities, generally through collaborative efforts among residents, local governments, businesses and various organizations. At the heart of successful community development is a robust educational system. An educated populace is better equipped to seize economic opportunities and effect positive change, helping to dissolve barriers and foster unity and cooperation. Education does more than facilitate individual achievement; it plays a critical role in attracting businesses and fostering job creation.

It then sheds light on how universities\u2019 expansion plans can have adverse localized price effects. It presents several lessons for urban and regional planning authorities to consider. First, the potential of universities to generate localized economic growth should not be underestimated. If surrounding housing supply remains inelastic, universities\u2019 expansion plans will create further upward pressure on housing prices. Second, the strategy of a university to concentrate its resources in particular urban areas, while attractive to certain businesses, hold potential downsides, including putting pressure on existing social and urban infrastructure. It is therefore important that planning authorities work closely together to ensure that both housing stock and associated infrastructure expand to mitigate any adverse impacts from a university\u2019s growth strategies. The entry concludes with a word of caution. The fallout of the global pandemic has left many universities facing major organizational restructuring, casting doubt on their ability, and need, to expand their physical footprints.

Many of the national efforts have been modelled after the U.S. Bayh-Dole Act. At the local level, universities and local governments have set up research parks located near university campuses, public venture capital funds, and business incubators with the goal of encouraging the formation of university spin-offs and regional high-tech clusters linked to university research. These policies have been motivated in part by a recognition that the high-value sectors of the economy are increasingly knowledge based and that universities, as both suppliers of knowledge workers and a source of ideas for industrial innovation, can play an important role in determining the location of new economy industries. Of more immediate and practical concern is that public funding of higher education and university research has been declining. Universities have been eager to find new sources of revenue and to demonstrate their broad economic value to government officials. Is it realistic to expect universities to be such a powerful attraction for high-tech firms? There are certainly some success stories. The current spatial distribution of biotech firms in the United States owes much to the residence and university affiliation of star scientists who made important early contributions to gene sequencing research. As has been told countless times in simple if incomplete stories of the Silicon Valley, faculty from Stanford University were important in the early growth of the semiconductor industry. Research Triangle Park would not have developed into a large high-tech cluster without early and continued support from the state of North Carolina. But associations do not imply causality.

Establishment-level data indicate faster growth in employment, wages, and corporate innovation after the Bayh-Dole Act\u2019s shock to the spread of innovation from universities in industries more closely related to the nearby university\u2019s innovative strengths. Federal research funding amplified the effect. University knowledge spillovers strengthen with geographic proximity, density, and local skills.

It then sheds light on how universities\u2019 expansion plans can have adverse localized price effects. It presents several lessons for urban and regional planning authorities to consider. First, the potential of universities to generate localized economic growth should not be underestimated. If surrounding housing supply remains inelastic, universities\u2019 expansion plans will create further upward pressure on housing prices. Second, the strategy of a university to concentrate its resources in particular urban areas, while attractive to certain businesses, hold potential downsides, including putting pressure on existing social and urban infrastructure. It is therefore important that planning authorities work closely together to ensure that both housing stock and associated infrastructure expand to mitigate any adverse impacts from a university\u2019s growth strategies. The entry concludes with a word of caution. The fallout of the global pandemic has left many universities facing major organizational restructuring, casting doubt on their ability, and need, to expand their physical footprints.

Multiple studies have found a correlation between the presence of a university in a large town or city and socio-economic development in the local area. They are key drivers of social, technological and economic innovation. With that fact comes one simple question: how do we make sure the impact upon a region is long-lasting and fit for purpose? There is not a one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it requires a nuanced exploration of potential avenues through which universities can enhance their community impact. Partner with the local community Initiate and nurture collaborative partnerships between universities and local stakeholders. This involves forging alliances with community organisations, governmental entities, businesses, schools, community groups and charitable organisations. Collaborations like these are instrumental in addressing shared objectives and challenges, pooling resources and leveraging collective expertise. By fostering these partnerships, universities and local communities can establish a dynamic platform for exchanging knowledge, resources and skills. These partnerships can help amplify the impact of initiatives, leading to more effective and sustainable development. For example, many universities participate in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), getting involved in successful collaborations with businesses. These play a pivotal role in facilitating innovation for growth and create a positive impact on both the business landscape and the community at large.

View all partners Education helps us share knowledge, develop understanding, and supports our connection with each other. As the COVID-19 pandemic has continued, governments have been preoccupied with how to re-open schools. However, there has been more doubt about universities. Discussions about the rise in COVID-19 infections in student populations have often raised the question as to why students are at university at all, running risks for themselves and local populations. These questions often link with views of universities as expensive, elitist \u2013 and perhaps not worth it at all. Together with colleagues, I have conducted research commissioned by the British Council to assess the value provided by higher education. We reviewed 170 research studies published since 2010 on the contribution universities make to societies. Our survey showed that the value of universities lies not just in the education they provided to students, but in a host of other additional areas. These include expanding the economy, supporting democracy, and advancing equality and sustainability. The role of universities We looked in particular at low and lower middle income countries, with a gross national income of below US$4,125 (\u00a33,178) per person. Our research sought to assess the economic, social and political benefits \u2013 or disadvantages \u2013 universities and other other forms of tertiary education brought to these societies.

Chapter First Online: 14 February 2023 pp 41\u201361 Cite this chapter Reframing the Civic University Sue Jarvis7\u00a0 Part of the book series: Rethinking University-Community Policy Connections ((REUNCOPOCO)) 178 Accesses Abstract The chapter considers what a civic agenda might look like from the perspective of the communities universities serve and shows how institutions can become more responsive to the resources, aspirations, needs and inequalities within their localities. It examines how community-university partnerships can begin to address complex issues of place by adopting asset-based approaches involving co-produced research and knowledge exchange of mutual benefit to the partners involved. One challenge is navigating the relationship between researchers and the researched to enable equal participation, which community-based participatory research methods seek to address. Another is the Research Excellence Framework\u2019s focus on world leading research over other forms of outputs, which can limit academic participation within institutions\u2019 localities. Drawing on three case studies, the chapter describes how the University of Liverpool collaborates with civic partners to leverage academic research for public benefit. It offers a reflection of how universities can position social impact within their strategic architecture and ensure community engagement practice and co-production methods become mutually reinforcing throughout the institution. It also reflects on practice from local government to assess how universities can go further in understanding their social impact.

Xiuli Guo outlines how Created in partnership with Created in partnership with You may also like Popular resources Universities play a pivotal role within their local communities. Multiple studies have found a correlation between the presence of a university in a large town or city and socio-economic development in the local area. They are key drivers of social, technological and economic innovation. With that fact comes one simple question: how do we make sure the impact upon a region is long-lasting and fit for purpose? There is not a one-size-fits-all answer. Instead, it requires a nuanced exploration of potential avenues through which universities can enhance their community impact. Partner with the local community Initiate and nurture collaborative partnerships between universities and local stakeholders. This involves forging alliances with community organisations, governmental entities, businesses, schools, community groups and charitable organisations. Collaborations like these are instrumental in addressing shared objectives and challenges, pooling resources and leveraging collective expertise. By fostering these partnerships, universities and local communities can establish a dynamic platform for exchanging knowledge, resources and skills. These partnerships can help amplify the impact of initiatives, leading to more effective and sustainable development. For example, many universities participate in Knowledge Transfer Partnerships (KTPs), getting involved in successful collaborations with businesses. These play a pivotal role in facilitating innovation for growth and create a positive impact on both the business landscape and the community at large.

But, as often happens, the more you think about it, the more difficult the decision becomes. The fact of the matter is, there are pros and cons to both options \u2014\u00a0it all comes down to which elements are most important to the college experience you hope to have. In an effort to make your choice easier, we canvassed a handful of professionals from all walks of life to learn the pros and cons of their experiences either attending a local college or moving to a new state to attend school. As you read their insight and determine which factors are most important in your college search, you\u2019ll be closer to deciding which option is right for you. 3 advantages of attending college close to home 1. It\u2019s a huge money-saver If you are able to live at home with your parents while attending college, there\u2019s no question that this can drastically minimize the overall price tag. Skipping the room and board costs alone can save you anywhere from $8,000 to $13,000 each year, according to Wendy Nelson, founder of mykidscollegechoice.com. Some students who choose to attend local colleges will opt to live on campus in hopes of still immersing themselves in the collegiate environment. Even in this case there are some money-saving perks to staying close to home. Some universities boast reduced in-state tuition opportunities for local students, and there is also the potential to receive local scholarships to aid in covering college costs. \u201cMany students are graduating drowning in student loan debt nowadays,\u201d explains Luis Rosa, financial advisor with Haydel Biel & Associates. \u201cStaying home and going to a local school can make a huge difference in how much the student or the parent will owe at the end of the four years.\u201d 2.

However, rather than drawing on the economic perspective, the research on which this chapter is based is focused on the socio-cultural impact of universities. It discusses some of the findings from the Higher Education and Regional Transformation (HEART) project, which explored the role universities play in the social and cultural experience of the regions, sub-regions and cities within which they are located, and especially in relation to alleviating social disadvantage. The chapter focuses on three themes running through the research project\u2019s case study universities: widening participation, community and civic engagement, and image and cultural attractiveness. These themes help explore the roles universities are performing and the extent to which they are helping to alleviate social disadvantage.

                  "raw_content": "Disadvantages of Community Colleges Transferring credits can sometimes be a problem, as each four-year college has its own requirements for enrollment. However, many four-year colleges (usually near the community college) have made arrangements, known as articulation agreements, allowing associate degrees to qualify for transfer, some cases allowing the student to complete the bachelor's degree via distance learning from the community college campus. Some states have passed rules whereby certain associate's degrees in a field will automatically transfer to state universities as the core curriculum for specified bachelor's degrees. Minnesota and Oregon have created a statewide \"transfer curriculum\" allowing credits to be transferred to any other public university and almost all of the private colleges. The North Carolina system has a similar agreement, whereby specific courses are designated for mandatory transfer credit to all statewide public four-year institutions. Illinois's I-transfer program program aids students in transferring credits across the state. California has a system known as Assist, which labels course equivalencies between all California Community Colleges and California public four-year colleges. In Arizona, the completion of the Arizona General Education Curriculum, or AGEC, at any Arizona community college guarantees residents of Arizona admission to any public university in the state of Arizona. It is frequent for many courses to be taught by part-time lecturers holding a master's degree (or bachelor's degree) in the field. Research conducted by the University of Washington's Labor Center suggests that community colleges' reliance on part-time (adjunct) faculty results in lower graduation rates than colleges with a full-time workforce. According to federal statistics, 42% of public community college freshmen take remedial courses, and further studies show that 79% of remedial courses are taught by part-time faculty.

Graduates with a four-year degree make more money than those with a two-year degree or a high school diploma. In fact, the National Center for Education Statistics suggests that, on average, people with a bachelor's degree make about 37% more than those with an associate degree. That's a big difference, and it\u2019s not just some groups that benefit. If you complete a four-year degree, regardless of gender or ethnicity, the pattern of earning more money holds true. Over a lifetime, with inflation and raises, this difference could easily amount to over a million-dollar difference in earnings. Of course, what you choose to study and the debt you take on will play a role in the equation. But if you finish a four-year degree, you'll set yourself up for better pay and more job security, especially when the economy is unstable. Historically, those with a bachelor\u2019s degree experienced a lower unemployment rate than those with only an associate degree. Most recently, this was true in 2020 when the unemployment rate tripled in the U.S. 2. Personal and Professional Development Arguably, one of the best parts of college is the opportunity to learn more about yourself and your interests and to find the right career path. In fact, when many people get to college, they discover ",

Promoting Success. \r \r Edit This Favorite\r \r New Study Shows Strong Evidence of Benefits of 4-Year Institutions Many NCAN members put a premium on enrollment in and graduation from a four-year postsecondary institution because of the benefits a bachelor\u2019s degree confers relative to other credentials. But a new study from Jonathan Smith, Joshua Goodman, and Michael Hurwitz offers more, and stronger, evidence of those benefits, especially for students from low-income backgrounds. The authors\u2019 findings are made possible by the University System of Georgia\u2019s (USG) minimum SAT requirement for admission to its 17 four-year universities (USGU). Having a minimum threshold like this is ripe for using a regression discontinuity design, and new research using data from Georgia shows causal evidence of the benefits. Jump to the bottom of this article for a quick refresher on terminology. The authors find many impacts of four-year enrollment: The paper\u2019s authors examined the outcomes of students who were just above and just below the SAT minimum for four-year admission to understand the impact of attending a four-year institution. The authors show that the students on either side of that threshold are essentially similar (a prerequisite\u00a0for their research design), so the differences observed in the outcomes of students above the minimum threshold are attributed to their enrollment in a four-year institution. (This is where the causality comes in.) This research has implications for both practice and policy. Programs looking to improve the evidence base for their emphasis on four-year enrollment can move this study to the top of their list. Policymakers should also consider this paper\u2019s conclusion, even in the midst of severe budget constraints: Many states explicitly ration access to the public four-year sector through required academic qualifications such as minimum SAT scores and GPAs. Others implicitly ration such access through processes that rely on the judgment of individual colle",

A new Pew Research Center survey, conducted in association with the Markle Foundation, and analysis of government data finds that employment in occupations requiring more education and training is on the rise, and many workers are realizing that retraining and upgrading their skills needs to be a lifetime commitment. Here are six key takeaways on the state of American jobs: Employment has been rising faster in occupations requiring more preparation. As of 2015, some 83 million people worked in jobs that require an average or above average level of preparation (including education, experience and job training), up from 49 million in 1980 \u2013 a 68% increase. This was more than double the 31% rise in employment in positions requiring a below average level of job preparation. Employment in these jobs increased from 50 million to 65 million over the same time period. Employment and wages have increased most in occupations that require higher social or analytical skills. While employment grew by 50% over all occupations from 1980 to 2015, this growth was much higher among jobs that require average or above average social skills (83%), such as interpersonal, management and communication skills, and those that require higher levels of analytical skills (77%), such as critical thinking and computer skills. Meanwhile, employment is up by only 18% in occupations depending more on physical skills such as manual labor, machinery operation or tool manipulation. Wages have also increased more among jobs requiring higher social or analytical skills. From 1990 to 2015, the average hourly wage for occupations requiring higher levels of analytical skills rose from $23 to $27. Simil",

In this article, we will discuss all of the above. Let\u2019s get to it! The Changing Landscape of Employment The constantly evolving job market is one of the main reasons why colleges are rethinking the traditional four-year degree model. Many employers value skills and experience over formal educational degrees. Businesses are looking for candidates with practical skills, adaptability, and ability to solve actual problems. Apart from that, rapid technological change means that traditional knowledge you have acquired in college may quickly become outdated. For instance, students often ask their professors how to develop essential skills that align with real-life applications so they don\u2019t have to look for \u00a0\u201cwrite me an essay\u201d services online.

Why Do You Need Adaptability This skill is vital due to several reasons: 1. Increasing Academic Challenges University courses often involve a significant step up in difficulty from high school. Students must adjust their study habits and learning strategies to cope with the depth and breadth of material presented. 2. The Use of More Technology With the increasing integration of technology in education, students need to be comfortable with online learning platforms, digital submission of assignments, and the use of various tech tools that are now standard in higher education. 3. Diverse Environments and Social Settings Students will meet peers from a variety of backgrounds and cultures.

Understandably, many families are reconsidering their higher education plans and evaluating other options including two-year degrees, trade schools, or a combination of starting at community college and then transferring after pre-requisites have been completed. Each pathway offers distinct advantages and disadvantages, including costs, future earning potential, varied student experiences and societal impacts.\u00a0\u00a0 For decades, the four-year degree has been considered the gold standard of higher education and associated with increased earning potential, a more advanced curriculum, and even higher life expectancy. The longer educational experience allows students to explore various subjects in greater detail and encourages critical thinking skills, intellectual curiosity and a deeper understanding of one's chosen field. Additionally, many students learn necessary life skills and benefit from significant personal growth during the traditional four-year college experience. Many professions require a bachelor's degree as a minimum qualification, therefore making a four-year degree essential for accessing certain career paths.\u00a0 However, the annual cost and duration of a four-year program requires significant investment, which is then compounded by the opportunity cost of lost potential income during those additional years of study (and compounded even further if the student needs additional time to complete the degree, which many do). Student loans have been necessary for many students to pursue this goal; however, students and their families may experience financial stress associated with that debt in the decades that follow. Some students have found that significant student debt resulted in delayed hom",

                  "raw_content": "The Benefits Of An Associate\u2019s Degree In Today\u2019s Job Market Education is crucial in securing and advancing one\u2019s career in the rapidly evolving job market. While bachelor\u2019s degrees have long been viewed as the standard for higher education, associate\u2019s degrees are gaining recognition for their practicality, affordability, and efficiency. This article explores the benefits of an associate\u2019s degree, highlighting how it can be a strategic investment for your future. What Is An Associate\u2019s Degree? An associate\u2019s degree is an undergraduate program typically completed in two years, offering a concentrated education in a specific field of study. These degrees are offered by community colleges, technical schools, and some universities. They provide a balance of general education courses and specialized training, preparing students for immediate entry into the workforce or further education. Cost-Effective Education Affordable Tuition The cost is one of the most significant benefits of pursuing an associate\u2019s degree. Tuition is generally much lower for associate\u2019s degree programs than bachelor\u2019s. This makes higher education accessible to a broader range of students, reducing the financial burden and potential student loan debt. Shorter Duration The two-year duration of an associate\u2019s degree program makes it more affordable and means students can enter the workforce sooner. This quicker transition from education to employment can lead to earlier earning potential and less time out of the job market. Flexibility And Accessibility Flexible Schedules Many associate degree institutions provide flexible scheduling options, including evening, weekend, and online classes. This flexibility allows students to balance their studies with work, family, and other responsibilities, making it an ideal choice for non-traditional students and working adults. Online Learning Opportunities With the rise of online education, earning an associate\u2019s degree has become more accessible than ever. Online programs offer the same rigorous curriculum ",

                  "raw_content": "How Connecting Degrees to Careers Can Address the Decline in Degree Value Four-year degrees have seen a marked drop in enrolment and completion rates in recent years. Learners are critically weighing the value of full degrees against typically shorter, less expensive skills-based learning, to quickly develop high-demand workplace skills. The investment in time and money \u2013 with no guarantee of work at the end \u2013 and the rise of skills-based hiring among employers are some of the key factors contributing to the decline in the perceived value of traditional degrees. In this information-rich Credentialate Guide, we ask \u2013 How much has the education landscape changed? What are the factors impacting enrolments? Where are learners going instead? And how can educators bolster the perceived value of degrees by connecting them more directly to work?

But as the COVID-19 pandemic forced learners around the world to confront a \u201cnew normal\u201d that in reality is far from new, that perceived value took a literal nose dive. Why? Well, it\u2019s simple. The economic value and return on investment of a four-year degree literally begs to be questioned. Learners who graduate no longer earn significantly more than those learners who choose alternate forms of education. In fact, one in four unemployed Australians has a degree. So are four-year degrees worth it? The question comes down to the evaluation of what degrees are for, and how they connect to a real-world benefit for learners. It is important to ad",

The rise in demand of bachelor\u2019s degrees for jobs that previously didn\u2019t require them is worrisome. And it\u2019s not because the skillsets have changed or the jobs have necessarily become more complicated or demanding. Rather, employers are defaulting to using a four-year degree as a proxy for a candidate\u2019s range and depth of skills. This degree inflation is a barrier to employment, it disenfranchises qualified, middle-skill workers, and it restricts employers\u2019 access to a wider pool of talent, as I previously wrote about here. Nearly two-thirds of employers have admitted to rejecting applicants with the required skills and experience simply because they didn\u2019t have a college degree, according to American Enterprise Institute\u2019s Frederick Hess. The root cause of degree inflation dates back to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, Hess continues. Employers couldn\u2019t discriminate against job applicants on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, but it did, however, allow employers to use professionally developed hiring tests as long as they weren\u2019t designed, intended or used to discriminate.

View the latest results and access historical reports: After two relatively down years connected with the COVID-19 pandemic, the outcomes rate for Class of 2022 bachelor\u2019s degree graduates returned to pre-pandemic levels. The unusual and uncertain times experienced by the college Class of 2021 in its final year was reflected in its outcomes, which improved from last year, but remained down from pre-pandemic levels, according to NACE\u2019s First Destinations for the College Class of 2021 report. NACE\u2019s First-Destination Survey Standards and Protocols were developed by a task force of practitioners, and reflect feedback provided during a public comment period by more than 100 career services professionals. The standards/protocols are designed to address the needs of individual institutions to track graduate outcomes, and can be used to address growing demand by accrediting bodies and governmental agencies. The College Scorecard limits post-graduate information to salary for the school as a whole. In this article, NACE's research director looks at how three factors\u2014type of school, demographics, and academic program\u2014affect salary results. Nearly 60% of Class of 2019 bachelor\u2019s grads were employed in full-time positions with a traditional employer and nearly 19% were going on for an advanced degree by the end of 2019. Class of 2020 graduates got fewer jobs than any other class since NACE first began reporting on employment trends with the Class of 2014.

Although it is acknowledged that health professionals need to possess high levels of resilience, there has been limited research comparing how different groups of health students, particularly school leaver undergraduates and mature age graduate entry students, develop resilience in their coursework. Methods This study combines both objective (academic grades with validated survey results) and subjective data (interviews) to compare how resilience is related to academic coursework performance for two groups of pharmacy students: the mature age graduate entry (GE, N\u2009=\u200964) learners and school leaver undergraduate (UG, N\u2009=\u2009208) learners. We employed a sequential explanatory mixed methods design using surveys, academic performance data and semi-structured interviews. The survey tapped constructs related to resilience (burnout, stressors and coping methods) while the interviews elicited a more nuanced understanding of individual and environmental factors. Results Although there was no statistical difference in burnout experience between the two groups, GE students exhibited more positive resilience attitudes than UG when selecting resilience statements on the survey. Both cohorts indicated in the survey that engaging in distraction activities (physical exercise, sleeping, listening to music, anything other than the stressor) was their most preferred method of relieving stress. Within UG student survey responses, those who indicated support from partners, friends and family had better academic performance, while those who did not report coping methods did worse academically. The three key environmental factors we identified that contributed to both undergraduate and graduate entry ",

All of these groups wonder, \u201cIs resiliency just a buzzword, or can we create action on it and impact our field?\u201d Higher education is asking the same question. While some institutions have unpacked and conceptualized resiliency so that it is woven into the fabric of their campus culture, others are mystified by resiliency programming, appreciating the end-goal but unsure of what it all looks like or where to start. Resilience is defined as \u201can ability to recover from or adjust easily to misfortune or change.\u201d In other words, resilience is the ability to bounce back.

Unlike a literature review, which broadly and inclusively assembles evidence, the focus of this synthesis has been intentionally narrowed to highlight common themes across empirical studies that meet a defined set of criteria for methodological scope and scale. The parameters are designed to emphasize those studies that reach evidence standards for the generalizability of findings. The results indicate that community-based and civic engagement in higher education have positive outcomes across six key areas: While there is rich and considerable evidence about the efficacy of high-impact practices on students\u2019 self-perceptions of their learning and engagement, and a perceived wealth of studies on the learning effects of students\u2019 participation in community-based and civic engagement, this synthesis reveals the gaps in current knowledge. Only fifty-three studies were identified that met our criteria for generalizability. Additionally, only eleven of those studies specifically address outcomes for historically underserved students, and those that do focus almost exclusively on retention and graduation outcomes. Existing research on community-based and civic experiences among college students most often examine a single community-based practice, primarily service learning. This narrow conception of community-engaged or civic practices has resulted in a paucity of evidence related to experiences such as study away, global learning, internships, field experiences, and community-based research.

However, a number of recent studies have questioned this established view by arguing that education is not a direct cause of political participation but only a proxy for other factors that are not directly related to the educational experience. This paper engages in a current debate regarding the application of matching techniques to assess whether there is a direct causal effect of education on political participation. It uses data from a British cohort study that follows everyone born during 1\u00a0week in the UK in 1970. The data includes a rich set of variables measuring factors through childhood and adolescence such as cognitive ability and family socioeconomic status. This data provides the opportunity to match on a number of important variables that are not included in the US datasets used by previous studies in the field. Results show that after matching there are no significant effects of education on political participation. This is a preview of subscription content, log in via an institution to check access.

There is abundant evidence that education at the individual level affects political participation. However, we lack studies that systematically link the effect of individual-level education to that of the environment. For example, what are the effects of being a member of a high vs. low education community? Using a dataset composed of a Norwegian citizen survey comprising more than 11,000 respondents living in 414 municipalities, we relate the effect of education at the individual level to that of the educational environment. The analyses reveal that the educational gap is smaller in high-educated environments and is in fact neutralized in those municipalities that have the greatest share of educated citizens. Thus, the Norwegian case lends support to the relative educational model; the higher the level of education in the environment, the smaller the effect of individual-level education. Judging from our study, citizens with few resources are not lifted by their environment, but educated citizens tend to free-ride in resourceful environments.

As we delve into the impact of education on voter participation, it becomes evident that despite increasing levels of education in the population, a proportional increase in voter turnout has not been observed. To understand this relationship, we will explore two theories: the absolute education theory and the relative education theory. The absolute education theory posits that higher education levels enhance cognitive skills and civic engagement, thereby increasing voter turnout. On the other hand, the relative education theory suggests that education\u2019s value is relative to other individuals in society. This means that as educational attainment increases across society, the threshold for educational gains also increases. Both theories have been found to hold true in various studies, but their impact may vary over time and in different election types. By examining these theories, we can gain insights into the complex relationship between education and voting behavior in the US. Key Takeaways: The Paradoxical Relationship Between Education and Voter Turnout When examining the impact of education on voter turnout in the United States, a paradoxical relationship emerges. While education is consistently associated with higher levels of political participation, including voting, the actual voter turnout does not reflect this trend. Despite the increase in educational attainment across the population, there has not been a proportional increase in voter participation. This paradox raises questions about the causal relationship between education and voter turnout and underscores the need to consider other factors in understanding political behavior. One possible explanation for this paradox is that education alone may not be sufficient to drive individuals to vote. While education contributes to increased civic engagement and political awarene",

Prior research suggests that the effect of college attendance on voting operates directly, by increasing an individual\u2019s interest and engagement in politics through social networks or human capital accumulation. College may also increase voting indirectly by leading to degree attainment and increasing socioeconomic status, thus facilitating political participation. However, few studies have empirically tested these direct and indirect pathways or examined how these effects vary across individuals. To bridge this gap, we employ a nonparame",

College Board New York\u2014As the price of attending college continues to rise and create anxiety among families, it\u2019s no surprise that the value of going to college is questioned. But the facts are clear: going to college pays off for individuals and society. Individuals with higher education levels earn more and are more likely to be employed and enjoy benefits such as a retirement account and health insurance. Adults with more education are also more likely to move up the socioeconomic ladder and less likely to receive public assistance, according to Education Pays 2019, the latest report from the College Board Trends in Higher Education series. \"Although obtaining a college degree can mean forgone wages during a time when a student is also paying tuition, by age 33 the average bachelor's degree recipient will have recouped those costs,\" explains Jennifer Ma, senior policy research scientist at College Board and a coauthor of the report. \"A higher education is an investment that pays significant dividends over the course of a lifetime\u2014even for students who accumulate some debt to obtain a degree.\" In 2018, the median earnings of bachelor's degree recipients age 25 working full time were nearly $25,000 higher than those of high school graduates.

Issue date 2021. Abstract Educational attainment is associated with voting and political trust, but less is known about whether voting and political trust are associated with subsequently higher educational attainment. In a sample of voting-age two-year college students in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent and Adult Health (n=1212), this study identified three markers of civic engagement in 2001 associated with greater attainment of certificates, associates degrees, and bachelor\u2019s degrees in 2008: voting, trusting the federal government, and affiliating with a political party. To minimize confounding, we used multivariate regression after exact and nearest-neighbor Mahalanobis matching within propensity score calipers on pre-college parent and adolescent socioeconomic status, demographics, educational expectations, health status, and parent civic participation. Voting in the 2000 presidential election was associated with greater likelihood of attaining a BA, or above; trusting the federal government was associated with greater likelihood of earning a certificate, associate\u2019s degree, or BA or above; and affiliating with a political party predicted greater likelihood of earning an associate\u2019s degree or BA, or above.

Introduction In a time of surging student loan debt, the benefits of a college education have once again become the subject of scrutiny and public debate. For younger Americans, the lesson of the Great Recession was that a four-year degree could no longer guarantee the career success and financial stability it once promised. What\u2019s more, the cost of a college education has exploded, leaving many graduates facing mounting debts. Many Americans are now left wondering: Is a college degree worth it? Amid this growing discussion, scholars, policy analysts, and legislators have been trying to quantify the financial advantage a secondary degree provides and measure its trade-offs. Despite concerns about rising student debt, the economic value of a college education is clear. Since the Great Recession, most of the jobs that have ",

College Board * January 2, 2017 NEW YORK \u2014 Individuals with higher education levels earn more, pay more taxes, and are more likely than others to be employed and to have job benefits such as retirement and health insurance. Adults with more education are also more likely to move up the socioeconomic ladder and less likely to rely on public assistance, according to Education Pays 2016, the latest report from the College Board\u2019s Trends in Higher Education series. Updated triennially since 2004, Education Pays: The Benefits of Higher Education for Individuals and Society documents differences in the earnings and employment patterns of U.S. adults with different levels of education. The report also establishes a correlation between education and health outcomes, community involvement, and indicators of the well-being of the next generation. In addition to documenting median earnings by education level, this year\u2019s report also includes data on variation in earnings by different characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, occupation, college major, and institutional sector. \u201cAlthough obtaining a college degree can mean forgone wages during a time when they are also paying tuition, by age 34 the average bachelor\u2019s degree recipient will have recouped those costs,\u201d explains Jennifer Ma, senior policy research scientist at",

Abstract While the robust and positive relationship between education and political engagement has been widely documented, the direct causal link is still a subject of debate. This study contributes to the ongoing debate by presenting suggestive evidence for the \u2018cause\u2019 view on the causal effect of education on political engagement. Exploiting the plausibly exogenous variation in education induced by the compulsory schooling reforms across 39 countries, we find that education cultivates political interest, promotes the acquisition of political knowledge, and fosters supportive attitudes towards political freedoms. Nevertheless, the better educated are no more likely to vote in elections nor adopt any specific position in the left\u2013right political spectrum. Introduction Political engagement refers to the emotional and cognitive involvement in political matters, such as political knowledge, interest, opinions, or attitudes; and encompasses citizens\u2019 actions to influence decisions of public officials such as voting, protesting, or political membership (Verba et al., 1995; Brady, 1999; Zukin et al., 2006; Barrett and Brunton-Smith, 2014).

You have full access to this open access article 20k Accesses 3 Citations 43 Altmetric 3 Mentions Explore all metrics Abstract The college-educated are more likely to vote than are those with less education. Prior research suggests that the effect of college attendance on voting operates directly, by increasing an individual\u2019s interest and engagement in politics through social networks or human capital accumulation. College may also increase voting indirectly by leading to degree attainment and increasing socioeconomic status, thus facilitating political participation. However, few studies have empirically tested these direct and indirect pathways or examined how these effects vary across individuals. To bridge this gap, we employ a nonparametric causal mediation analysis to examine the total, direct, and indirect effects of college attendance on voting and how these effects differ across individuals with different propensities of attending college. Using data from the 1979 and 1997 cohorts of National Longitudinal Surveys of Youth, we find large direct effects of college on self-reported voting and comparably smaller indirect effects that operate through degree completion and socioeconomic attainment. We find the largest impact of college on voting for individuals unlikely to attend, a pattern due primarily to heterogeneity in the direct effect of college. Our findings suggest that civic returns to college are not contingent upon degree completion or socioeconomic returns. An exclusive focus on the economic returns to college can mask the broader societal benefits of expanding higher education to disadvantaged youth.

Arke, 2005 iv Abstract This study investigated the relationship between media literacy and critical thinking skills. To date media literacy advocates have not developed a quantitative means of measuring media literacy. While numerous claims that media literacy and critical thinking are related, a review of the existing literature has not revealed any academic support for the assertion. As a result, a demographic survey and test to measure each skill set respectfully was administered to a sample of undergraduate college students. For this study, a new media literacy measure was developed. Statistical analysis of the test results did show a statistically significant correlation between the scores recorded on each measure (r(34) = 0.322, p < 0.05). The results did not provide support for statistically significant correlations between college students\u2019 self-reported level of media literacy education or self-reported media consumption and their critical thinking scores.

Unlike a literature review, which broadly and inclusively assembles evidence, the focus of this synthesis has been intentionally narrowed to highlight common themes across empirical studies that meet a defined set of criteria for methodological scope and scale. The parameters are designed to emphasize those studies that reach evidence standards for the generalizability of findings. The results indicate that community-based and civic engagement in higher education have positive outcomes across six key areas: While there is rich and considerable evidence about the efficacy of high-impact practices on students\u2019 self-perceptions of their learning and engagement, and a perceived wealth of studies on the learning effects of students\u2019 participation in community-based and civic engagement, this synthesis reveals the gaps in current knowledge. Only fifty-three studies were identified that met our criteria for generalizability. Additionally, only eleven of those studies specifically address outcomes for historically underserved students, and those that do focus almost exclusively on retention and graduation outcomes. Existing research on community-based and civic experiences among college students most often examine a single community-based practice, primarily service learning. This narrow conception of community-engaged or civic practices has resulted in a paucity of evidence related to experiences such as study away, global learning, internships, field experiences, and community-based research.

This new report synthesizes existing research on a range of widespread teaching and learning practices whose effects on college student outcomes have been extensively examined and documented. Several of these practices, known collectively as \u201chigh-impact practices,\u201d or HIPs, engage students in community-based experiences intended to develop their civic capacities. The report focuses primarily on the effects of various forms of community-based and civic engagement in higher education and identifies positive outcomes across six broad areas: Funded by a grant from Lumina Foundation, the report highlights empirical trends across studies that met a defined set of criteria for methodological scope and scale intended to speak to greater generalizability of findings. Though hundreds of studies exist with regard to outcomes related to community-based and civic engagement, relatively few studies (53) met the criteria for generalizability. Fewer still (11) specifically address findings for students from demographic groups historically underserved by higher education, and those that do are focused almost exclusively on retention and graduation rates. Much of the existing research on community-based and civic engagement examines a single community-based practice, most commonly service learning.

While personal advantages, such as career opportunities and growth, are often highlighted, we sometimes overlook how higher education impacts society as a whole. The broader benefits stretch far beyond individual achievements and contribute to a well-rounded, informed, and just society. Understanding this larger impact can motivate individuals to pursue higher learning, knowing they are part of a larger mission to improve the world.\u00a0 This article will explore how higher education plays a pivotal role in shaping societies that are not only successful but fair, innovative, and resilient. 1. Drives Economic Growth and Stability One of the most evident benefits of higher education is its impact on economic growth and stability. A well-educated workforce is essential for a thriving economy. With higher education, individuals can access better job opportunities that pay well, increasing overall economic productivity and consumer spending. This cycle bolsters local and national economies, fostering growth and stability. Furthermore, higher education institutions are hotbeds for innovation, often leading to the development of new businesses and startups. Graduates with entrepreneurial skills and creative thinking contribute fresh ideas and solutions that stimulate economic activity. For example, many successful tech companies started as university projects and have significantly boosted economic growth. 2. Promotes Justice and Fairness in Society Higher education strengthens society by contributing to a more just and fair environment. This is especially true in the legal and criminal justice sectors, where law and PsyD forensic psychology degrees play vital roles. Legal professionals armed with comprehensive knowledge can navigate complex cases and advocate for fairness, ensuring the legal system operates justly. Forensic experts with advanced e",

Key points that will help convince politicians and policymakers about the importance of funding and prioritising higher education include: 1. Higher education drives economic growth and competitiveness. A well-educated workforce is more productive, innovative and adaptable to changing market conditions. 2. Higher education promotes social mobility and reduces income inequality. Higher education provides individuals with the skills and knowledge to move up the social and economic ladder. 3. Higher education enhances social cohesion and develops an engaged and informed citizenry. 4. Investing in higher education results in positive economic and social outcomes. It supports the creation of new jobs, increased tax revenue and the growth of local businesses. Universities are major employers in their communities, contributing to local economic development. As an academic or institutional leader, persuading policymakers and governmental stakeholders to support higher education is a critical yet challenging task. Competing priorities, the complex nature of higher education, funding constraints, the immediacy of tangible results, political considerations, and levels of awareness and understanding can persuade or dissuade government to support higher education.

This new report synthesizes existing research on a range of widespread teaching and learning practices whose effects on college student outcomes have been extensively examined and documented. Several of these practices, known collectively as \u201chigh-impact practices,\u201d or HIPs, engage students in community-based experiences intended to develop their civic capacities. The report focuses primarily on the effects of various forms of community-based and civic engagement in higher education and identifies positive outcomes across six broad areas: Funded by a grant from Lumina Foundation, the report highlights empirical trends across studies that met a defined set of criteria for methodological scope and scale intended to speak to greater generalizability of findings. Though hundreds of studies exist with regard to outcomes related to community-based and civic engagement, relatively few studies (53) met the criteria for generalizability. Fewer still (11) specifically address findings for students from demographic groups historically underserved by higher education, and those that do are focused almost exclusively on retention and graduation rates. Much of the existing research on community-based and civic engagement examines a single community-based practice, most commonly service learning. Far less is known about the effects of global learning and study away, internships, field experiences, and community-based research.

Unlike a literature review, which broadly and inclusively assembles evidence, the focus of this synthesis has been intentionally narrowed to highlight common themes across empirical studies that meet a defined set of criteria for methodological scope and scale. The parameters are designed to emphasize those studies that reach evidence standards for the generalizability of findings. The results indicate that community-based and civic engagement in higher education have positive outcomes across six key areas: While there is rich and considerable evidence about the efficacy of high-impact practices on students\u2019 self-perceptions of their learning and engagement, and a perceived wealth of studies on the learning effects of students\u2019 participation in community-based and civic engagement, this synthesis reveals the gaps in current knowledge. Only fifty-three studies were identified that met our criteria for generalizability. Additionally, only eleven of those studies specifically address outcomes for historically underserved students, and those that do focus almost exclusively on retention and graduation outcomes. Existing research on community-based and civic experiences among college students most often examine a single community-based practice, primarily service learning. This narrow conception of community-engaged or civic practices has resulted in a paucity of evidence related to experiences such as study away, global learning, internships, field experiences, and community-based research. Campuses and higher education in general would benefit from the recognition of the community and civic contributions of these add",

However, the academic literature is unclear whether HE plays a causal role in changing peoples\u2019 political attitudes or is simply a proxy. Furthermore, in many contexts, there is limited descriptive evidence on whether students\u2019 political attitudes change during HE. This paper focuses on the UK, using data from the British Election Study, to make a twofold contribution. Firstly, the paper introduces recent political science theorising on the nature of contemporary political divisions, which has remained largely outside the HE literature to date. This theorising is illustrated through a cross-sectional analysis, comparing the political attitudes of those with and without experience of HE, showing that the former tend to be more left-leaning and less ethnocentric.\u00a0Secondly, a longitudinal analysis is performed to assess how students\u2019 political attitudes change during their time in HE. While in HE, students tend to make small movements to the left and become less ethnocentric, representing approximately 20\u201333% of the overall division between those with and without experience of HE. These findings are interpreted through a critical realist lens\u2014they evidence that HE could have a causal role to play in creating contemporary political",

Most say a college degree is important, if not essential, in helping a young person succeed in the world, and college graduates themselves say their degree helped them grow and develop the skills they needed for the workplace. While fewer than half of today\u2019s young adults are enrolled in a two-year or four-year college, the share has risen steadily over the past several decades. And the economic advantages college graduates have over those without a degree are clear and growing. Even so, there is an undercurrent of dissatisfaction \u2013\u00a0even suspicion \u2013 among the public about the role colleges play in society, the way admissions decisions are made and the extent to which free speech is constrained on college campuses. And these views are increasingly linked to partisanship. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that only half of American adults think colleges and universities are having a positive effect on the way things are going in the country these days. About four-in-ten (38%) say they are having a negative impact \u2013 up from 26% in 2012. The share of Americans saying colleges and universities have a negative effect has increased by 12 percentage points since 2012. The increase in negative views has come almost entirely from Republicans and independents who lean Republican. From 2015 to 2019, the share saying colleges have a negative effect on the country went from 37% to 59% among this group. Over that same period, the views of Democrats and independents who lean Democratic have remained largely stable and overwhelmingly positive.

A new report measures the \u201creturn on investment\u201d offered by various higher education programs. By Ann Carrns Most four-year degrees pay off by paving the way for graduates to recoup the cost of their education relatively quickly, a new analysis finds. But that\u2019s particularly true for some programs, while others may offer little economic advantage over a high school diploma. The findings are part of a report on some 38,000 post-high school degree and certificate programs published this week by Third Way, a center-left public policy group. The report analyzed data collected for the federal Education Department\u2019s \u201cCollege Scorecard\u201d tool to measure the \u201creturn on investment\u201d offered by various higher education programs. The report found that almost two-thirds of the 26,000 bachelor\u2019s degree programs in the study enabled a majority of their graduates to make enough money to recover their costs in 10 years or less after graduation. Bachelor\u2019s degree programs, which typically take four years, are generally more expensive but are most likely to show at least some return on investment \u2014 meaning graduates earn enough to pay off their college costs reasonably quickly \u2014 for those who complete a degree, compared with two-year associate degrees or shorter certificate programs. That\u2019s good news for students who completed those four-year programs, said the report\u2019s author, Michael Itzkowitz, senior fellow for higher education at Third Way and a former director of the College Scorecard. Certain fields of study, however \u2014 typically those in higher-paying fields like engineering or health care \u2014 are substantially more likely to lead to a speedier economic boost than fields like the arts, religion or biology.

It's no secret that college is expensive. Both private and public institutions ranked by U.S. News saw tuition increases for the 2022-2023 academic year, according to data submitted in an annual survey. Average tuition and fees at ranked private universities was about $40,000, while ranked public universities cost nearly $23,000 for out-of-state students and $10,500 for in-state students. In turn, the average student loan debt continues to rise, currently clocking in at about $30,000 per borrower, according to U.S. News data. Though students may encounter difficulties paying for it, college is a worthwhile investment when done wisely, experts say. In 2021, the median weekly wage for full-time workers age 25 and older who had at least a bachelor\u2019s degree was $1,334, compared to $809 for those with only a high school diploma and no college, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Abstract Our understanding about the relationship between education and lifetime earnings often neglects differences by field of study. Utilizing data that matches respondents in the Survey of Income and Program Participation to their longitudinal earnings records based on administrative tax information, we investigate the trajectories of annual earnings following the same individuals over 20 years and then estimate the long-term effects of field of study on earnings for U.S. men and women. Our results provide new evidence revealing large lifetime earnings gaps across field of study. We show important differences in individuals\u2019 earnings trajectories across the different stages of the work-life by field of study. In addition, the gaps in 40-year (i.e., ages 20 to 59) median lifetime earnings among college graduates by field of study are larger, in many instances, than the median gap between high school graduates and college graduates overall. Significant variation is also found among graduate degree holders. Our results uncover important similarities and differences between men and women with regard to the long-term earnings differentials associated with field of study. In general, these findings underscore field of study as a critical dimension of horizontal stratification in educational attainment. Other implications of the empirical f",

In 1963, the average total tuition and fees for all institutions was $4,939 (in 2022-2023 dollars) or $508 at the time. In 2023, it was $15,919 (in constant 2022-2023 dollars). Note that these are average tuition and fees for all public and private institutions. Students must also consider room and board, textbooks and supplies, and living expenses. Financial aid can cover tuition and fees, room and board, and books but not the incidental costs.\u00a0\u00a0 The actual cost of college degrees differs between institutions, too. Fayetteville State University, for example, charges $2,262 per year on average. Harvard University, in contrast, charges an average of $59,076 per year. Featured Programs Why should students and their parents understand the cost of college over time? First, it\u2019s useful in personal financial planning. Students can expect an increase in tuition and fees, among others, and plan for it. This can include applying for more financial aid and tapping into more resources. Second, policymakers use the information to create strategies for more affordable college costs. The government works toward an educated workforce because of its crucial importance. A more educated workforce contributes to better economic growth and social development. For these reasons, we\u2019ll look at the cost of a college degree over time in the United States. We\u2019ll also discuss effective ways of dealing with the rising costs of a college degree.\u00a0 Related Articles: The History of College Tuition We classified the increase in college tuition over time into specific time frames.

College graduates generally out-earn those who have not attended college, and they are more likely to be employed in the first place. At the same time, many Americans say they cannot afford to get a four-year degree \u2013 or that they just don\u2019t want to. Here are key facts about American college graduates. This Pew Research Center analysis about U.S. college graduates relies on data from sources including the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Student Clearinghouse and the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as surveys conducted by the Center. Everyone who took the Pew Research Center surveys cited is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about\u00a0the ATP\u2019s methodology. Nearly four-in-ten Americans ages 25 and older have a bachelor\u2019s degree, a share that has grown over the last decade. As of 2021, 37.9% of adults in this age group held a bachelor\u2019s degree, including 14.3% who also obtained a graduate or professional degree, according to data from the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey. That share is up 7.5 percentage points from 30.4% in 2011. An additional 10.5% had an associate degree in 2021. About four-in-ten Americans ages 25 and older had a high school diploma with no further education (25.3%) or completed some college but didn\u2019t have a degree (14.9%). In a reversal, women are now more likely than men to graduate from college, according to the Current Population Su",

A new report from the Strada Institute for the Future of Work and the Burning Glass Institute finds that many students struggle with this transition, with only about half of graduates with a bachelor\u2019s degree securing employment in a college-level job within one year of graduating. In this report, college-level employment refers to jobs that require a four-year degree, and underemployment refers to jobs that do not require a bachelor\u2019s degree. Key highlights from the report include: First job matters: Among those that secure a college-level job as soon as they graduate, 79 percent remain in a college-level occupation five years after graduating. Underemployment stays with you: Individuals who start out underemployed are 3.5 times more likely to be underemployed a decade after graduation compared to those whose first job is a college-level job. Underemployment is a large, persistent problem: Fifty-two percent of graduates with a bachelor\u2019s degree are underemployed one year after graduating, and 45 percent are still underemployed ",

                  "raw_content": " Class of 2024: Young college graduates have experienced a rapid economic recovery Key findings: The labor market for young college graduates today is stronger than it was before the pandemic and has been for quite some time. This strong recovery was not guaranteed\u2014instead, it was a direct result of an aggressive fiscal policy response to the pandemic\u2019s economic shock. This bounceback\u2014not just for young college graduates but for all workers\u2014has been much faster than recoveries following recessions over the past 30 years, when fiscal policy was not used at scale. In this blog post, we first examine employment and enrollment outcomes to determine what young college graduates are doing. We then analyze the short- and long-run trends in unemployment, underemployment, and wages for young college graduates\u2014defined as workers ages 21 to 24\u2014with only a four-year college degree and who are not enrolled in further schooling.1 As of March 2024, 65.2% of young college graduates are \u201cemployed only\u201d (not enrolled in further schooling), while only 10.0% are \u201cidled\u201d (not enrolled and not employed, which includes the unemployed). The share of young graduates who are \u201cemployed only\u201d has been above its pre-pandemic level (64.3% in February 2020) in every month since February 2023. While the share of young college graduates who are neither employed nor enrolled in further schooling is lower relative to the pre-pandemic peak, there is a mild long-run upward trend in this share since 1989. Young people can be \u201cidled\u201d for many reasons, including caring for children (or other family members) or having a disability. \u201cIdled\u201d young adults lose vital work experience and further education, which translates to compounding losses in their lifetime earnings. Next, we narrow the sample of young college graduates to those not currently enrolled in further schooling to assess the labor market for those looking to make work their primary activity.

According to April 2024 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, people with bachelor's degrees earn a median salary of $77,636 per year\u2014more than $30,000 above the median earnings for people whose highest education is a high school diploma. Of course, though, not every college grad will hit those numbers. Stacker compiled a list of the majors with the highest and lowest unemployment rates using data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which created its latest analysis using 2021 data from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey via IPUMS. Majors listed are ranked from highest to the lowest unemployment rate, with ties broken by underemployment rate. Median wages are for full-time workers with bachelor's degrees. Unemployment and underemployment rates listed here are for recent college graduates, which the analysis defines as those between ages 22 and 27 with at least a bachelor's degree.

This article explores diverse careers that don\u2019t require a college degree, practical steps to pursue them, and how to overcome common challenges.

Countless opportunities prioritize skills over degrees. Did you know that nearly 35% of U.S. jobs don\u2019t require a college degree but offer competitive salaries and growth potential? Fields like technology, skilled trades, and freelancing are booming, providing a wealth of options for individuals ready to focus on building expertise rather than accumulating debt.

In January 2024, the Associated Builders and Contractors (ABC) organization estimated that the construction industry will need to attract an additional 501,000 workers this year on top of the normal pace of hiring to meet the demand for labor. In 2025, another 454,000 new workers will be needed to keep the industry on track. \u201cABC estimates that the U.S. construction industry needs to attract about a half million new workers in 2024 to balance supply and demand,\u201d said Michael Bellaman, ABC president and CEO. \u201cNot addressing the shortage through an all-of-the-above approach to workforce development will slow improvements to our shared built environment, worker productivity, living standards, and the places where we heal, learn, play, work and gather.\u201d The Impact of the Skilled Tradesmen Shortage CNBC reported that the tight U.S. labor market, where job openings have reached as high as two for each available worker, is helping stoke the engine of inflation that continues to challenge companies looking to hire skilled workers. \u201cBroadly, there are two factors shaping the interaction between construction worker supply and demand,\u201d said ABC Chief Economist Anirban Basu. \u201cThere are structural factors, including outsized retirement levels, megaprojects in several private and public construction segments, and cultural factors that encourage too few young people to enter the skilled construction trades. There are also structural factors, including those related to interest rates, consumer sentiment, and general economic performance.\u201d From a shortage of electricians to plumbers to carpenters to machinists to steelworkers to welders to pipefitters, the skilled tradesmen shortage is a drag on the U.S. economy\u2019s continuing recovery from the pandemic.

While my school did offer a vocational track, there was quite a bit of pressure placed upon me to work towards attending a 4-year university\u2026 not just by society, but by my family. My parents only attended community college and often attributed their career choices to this fact. Dad was a postal worker and mom a secretary.\u00a0 Later, she went to teach in a pre-school as an instructional aide (although I felt she could have taught the class on her own).\u00a0 Finally, after a back injury, she went to work for a doctor as a receptionist. Despite them both having full-time jobs, my father still had a lawn business before and after work. It was necessary in order to pay the bills, put food on the table and take us on vacations once a year. They always said my brother and I deserved better and needed to go away to school. So, we did. I finished school with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and am doing what I always wanted to do. I\u2019m a mother of four and part-time writer/editor. My brother, on the other hand, never wound up doing what he originally set out to do \u2013 which was become a veterinarian. Instead, he dropped out of college and took an entry level job as an insurance underwriter. Today, my brother is making six figures and lives a very comfortable life\u2026 and he is a \u201ccollege dropout\u201d. So why all the fuss today about needing a master\u2019s degree or more to lead a successful life?

But while having a college degree can make it easier to get a job sometimes, there are plenty of other ways to succeed. Just look at these people, who did just fine without one. Bill Gates The classic example of someone achieving without a college degree, Gates' dropped out of Harvard before he finished his course, and is now worth $76 billion.

Not exactly a model student, but when he's directed the two most successful films of all time in Avatar and Titanic, it's hard to complain. Henry Ford Advertisement Although he didn't invent either the car or the production line, he improved on the two ideas so much that his Model T was the first really affordable car ever made, and brought driving to the masses. Adjusted for inflation, Ford's peak net worth was around $188 billion before his death in 1947. John D. Rockefeller Sr. But even Ford wasn't as rich as John D. R",

While my school did offer a vocational track, there was quite a bit of pressure placed upon me to work towards attending a 4-year university\u2026 not just by society, but by my family. My parents only attended community college and often attributed their career choices to this fact. Dad was a postal worker and mom a secretary.\u00a0 Later, she went to teach in a pre-school as an instructional aide (although I felt she could have taught the class on her own).\u00a0 Finally, after a back injury, she went to work for a doctor as a receptionist. Despite them both having full-time jobs, my father still had a lawn business before and after work. It was necessary in order to pay the bills, put food on the table and take us on vacations once a year. They always said my brother and I deserved better and needed to go away to school. So, we did. I finished school with a bachelor\u2019s degree in English and am doing what I always wanted to do. I\u2019m a mother of four and part-time writer/editor. My brother, on the other hand, never wound up doing what he originally set out to do \u2013 which was become a veterinarian. Instead, he dropped out of college and took an entry level job as an insurance underwriter. Today, my brother is making six figures and lives a very comfortable life\u2026 and he is a \u201ccollege dropout\u201d. So why all the fuss today about needing a master\u2019s degree or more to lead a successful life? If you are willing to put in the work, there are plenty of opportunities for success; but don\u2019t just take my word for it. Today, we\u2019re going to p",

Guess what, though? They have accomplished much more than getting good grades from school or university. People continue to question the decisions that were made by dropouts, asking, \"Will they thrive as successful contributors to society?\" But trust me when I say that going from being a dropout student with nothing in their pocket to becoming one of the most successful millionaire entrepreneurs in the world has greatly increased respect for determination and commitment to one's aims.

However, there are certain people who have proved this notion wrong by turning this mistake into huge achievements. The following is a list of the biggest entrepreneurs in the world, who dropped out of their education in the middle. Bill Gates Bill Gates is known to be the inventor of the college-dropout billionaire trope in 1975 when he left Harvard to start his career in establishing Microsoft. At the age of 13, \u00a0he wrote his first software program to get admission to a private Lakeside school, which revealed his affinity for programming. Whilst at Lakeside school, Gates earned the title of National Merit Scholar, in which he scored 1590 out of 1600 on the SAT. To support his father\u2019s dream of making him becoming a lawyer, he enrolled at Harvard as a pre-law student in 1973, and aced mathematics and computer science courses.

That may be true for some, but for a select few in this world, they just seem to have what it takes to make millions, even billions, without any type of degree to their name. It starts with an idea and that idea develops into a plan that leads to a successful business, product or company that takes off and makes the developer or owner very wealthy.

What are the Costs of Not Finishing College Critiques of higher education have become more widespread than ever before. As new scandals emerge, student loan debt rises, and job scarcity ebbs and flows, people are frequently questioning the sanctity of a college degree. Is it really worth it? Do I really need a college degree to be successful? The answer is complex; it depends on who you are, but chances are that if you started and never finished, there was something that drew you in the first place. Think about the personal and professional goals that prompted you to enroll. If those haven\u2019t changed, they might be better achieved with a college degree. Going back to school can be an intimidating endeavor, but the costs of not finishing college can be an even greater burden to bear. One of the biggest costs of not finishing your college degree is lower earning potential. A college degree has, for the most part, remained a valuable tool to enter a well-paying career. While money may not be a motivation for all, it is certainly not to be ignored. According to an issue paper published by the Lumina Foundation, individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree make about 134% more than high school graduates with some college experience. This trend means that individuals with at least a bachelor\u2019s degree are less likely to fall under the poverty line and enjoy higher overall lifetime earnings.\u00a0 Pervasive criticisms claim that the burden of student loans outweighs the benefits of a college degree. Student loan debt is at an all time high, and students are right to be wary of incurring debt. However, it\u2019s not just about money! Many critics fail to account for other benefits to having a college degree: Health Insurance One of the most valuable forms of compensation is employer-provided health insurance. On average, 76% of individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree receive health insurance through employment, whereas only 61% of those with some college receive ",

Of first-time, full-time students in four-year institutions, less than 60 percent finish a bachelor's degree within six years. In community colleges, it's worse: just a third of students earn an associate's degree within three years. A new working paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research has examined this \"completion crisis\" to understand its causes and potential interventions. The result is a compact comparison that helps college leaders understand the differences between various college completion programs, including their costs. The report identified four broad hurdles for students in completing their degrees: Under-preparation. Often students don't take the courses in high school to set them up for college success, forcing them to take non-credit remedial or development coursework to make up for the loss \u2014 setting them back from the beginning. Students may also lack the study skills needed to tackle college-level coursework. Institutional barriers. Many students have difficulty navigating systems such as enrollment, financial aid and other processes. For example, studies have found that students need help understanding course and degree requirements, or are sidetracked by failing to register for the right courses on time. Personal non-academic barriers. These obstacles can include health issues, financial problems, mental health struggles, child care challenges, transportation difficulties and even disconnection from the college community.

College graduates generally out-earn those who have not attended college, and they are more likely to be employed in the first place. At the same time, many Americans say they cannot afford to get a four-year degree \u2013 or that they just don\u2019t want to. Here are key facts about American college graduates. This Pew Research Center analysis about U.S. college graduates relies on data from sources including the Census Bureau, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the National Center for Education Statistics, the National Student Clearinghouse and the Federal Reserve Bank, as well as surveys conducted by the Center. Everyone who took the Pew Research Center surveys cited is a member of the Center\u2019s American Trends Panel (ATP), an online survey panel that is recruited through national, random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories. Read more about\u00a0the ATP\u2019s methodology. Nearly four-in-ten Americans ages 25 and older have a bachelor\u2019s degree, a share that has grown over the last decade.

That share is up 7.5 percentage points from 30.4% in 2011. An additional 10.5% had an associate degree in 2021. About four-in-ten Americans ages 25 and older had a high school diploma with no further education (25.3%) or completed some college but didn\u2019t have a degree (14.9%).

With the state of the economy, a bachelor\u2019s degree isn\u2019t enough anymore. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re college-educated because you won\u2019t find a job. College isn\u2019t worth what it used to be; that\u2019s why the success rate of college graduates vs. non-graduates is important.

On the other hand, high school graduates faced a 5.2% unemployment rate.That\u2019s a pretty stark divide. Fast forward nearly two years into the current administration (August 2018), and these numbers are much closer: a 2.1% unemployment rate for college graduates and a 4.3% unemployment rate for high school graduates.Clearly, neither college graduates nor high school graduates have issues finding a job. Still, college graduates hold a slight edge over high school graduates in this regard.In fact, data indicate that the employment of college graduates has been up 21% since the last decade, meaning that the demand for college graduates is in in",

It shows the highest level of academic progress made, broken out by the type of starting institution and enrollment intensity at entry. The report is designed to help institutions and states better identify and inform effective intervention points to increase student success. The latest data presents yearly academic progress for approximately 2.3 million individuals who began college for the first time in fall 2016 with the intent to earn a credential. Their overall four-year and six-year completion rates have increased compared to the fall 2015 cohort but the disadvantage for those enrolling part time remains unchanged. This report series measures academic progress in each subsequent academic year for six years after entry, broken out by the type of starting institution and enrollment intensity at entry (full-time vs. part-time). Results do not account for enrollment intensity changes after entry. The outcome categories are modeled after those used in the Student Achievement Measure (SAM), and can be used as the most current national and state benchmarks for institutions participating in SAM. Unlike in SAM reporting, undergraduate certificates are counted as completions in this report. National Highlights National four-year and six-year completion rates continued to improve but stop-out rates also rose over the previous cohort. Of 1.9 million full-time starters, 48.8 percent completed a postsecondary credential by year four, and 67.7 percent by year six. These reflect completion rate gains of 1.5 percentage points (by year four) and 0.4 percentage points (by year six) over last year\u2019s cohort. In contrast, 25.1 percent left college without earning a credential six years later, up from 24.9 percent last year. About 20 percent of 420,000 part-time starters c",

Many wonder if the investment in time and money is worth it. In this article, we explore some compelling reasons why going to college is crucial for your professional life. From higher earnings to personal growth, the benefits of obtaining a college degree can shape your career trajectory in ways you might not have imagined. Let\u2019s dive into how a college education can open doors to better opportunities and secure a brighter future. 1. Broader Employment Opportunities Attending college can dramatically widen your job prospects. Many careers today require at least a bachelor\u2019s degree as an entry-level qualification. Fields such as engineering, healthcare, education, and technology emphasize the importance of a comprehensive educational background that a four-year program provides. Moreover, a degree from a reputable college can often catch the eye of top employers who value the rigorous training and education provided at these institutions. This broader range of opportunities is crucial in finding a fulfilling and stable career path. 2. Higher Earning Potential One of the most straightforward reasons to go to college is the potential for higher earnings. Statistics consistently show that people who go to four year colleges tend to earn more than those without a degree. According to BLS, individuals with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn about $650,000 more in their lifetime than those with only a high school diploma. Over a lifetime, this difference can add up to a significant income disparity, making the financial aspect of earning a degree quite appealing. 3.

                  "raw_content": "Does College Matter? College does matter and is absolutely worth it - if you choose a program that matches your career goals, graduate on time, and avoid too much debt. Almost every job that leads to a promising career, with good pay and benefits, requires education or training beyond high school. For most high-paying professional jobs, that means a four-year college degree. At the same time, career training or short-term educational programs for a growing number of technical fields can pay off, too. For many, the question is: college or trade school? Is college worth the cost? If you stick with your studies and graduate in a reasonable time, college is worth the cost. The vast majority of college graduates are better off financially than their peers who didn\u2019t complete college. College degrees are still in high demand from employers, and completing college is a strong sign that you\u2019re ready for high-skilled work. The key is finding a school where you\u2019re likely to graduate and finish with low or modest debt. The national average is about $29,400, which most graduates are able to pay off because their degree helped them earn a well-paying job. You can find detailed information about college graduation rates, the real cost of college over time, and how potential earnings vary by career field at bigfuture.org. And you can give yourself the opportunity to save time and money toward a degree while you\u2019re in high school by scoring a 3 or higher on an AP Exam to earn college credit. Students can get into trouble when they don\u2019t graduate, or when they take on significant debt before they\u2019re able to finish. Many college students don\u2019t graduate on time, which makes a degree more expensive. Or they don\u2019t finish at all, which means they don\u2019t get the benefit of higher earnings. Finishing college is the single most important thing you can do to make it affordable. Students who leave college without graduating are the most likely to have trouble with debt and future employment. As many as 4 in 10 students who start a 4-year de",

I didn\u2019t go to Harvard, but the people working for me did.\u201d ~ Elon Musk In the unfolding narrative of the 21st-century job market, the spotlight has shifted from the paper credentials of certificates and degrees to the robust display of skills.\u00a0 This third and final article in our series explores the rising value of practical abilities over traditional academic achievements, a trend that mirrors the demands of a dynamic global economy.

Table of Contents The Rising Value of Skills over Certificates Two years ago, former McKinsey partner Byron Auguste founded Opportunity@Work, catering to what he felt was \u201can invisible pool of capable people.\u201d His take on this subject was that employers were overlooking skilled candidates who were blocked by arbitrary degree requirements. (Source) Today\u2019s Students are attuning to a fundamental truth: while degrees lay the theoretical groundwork, it\u2019s the practical, hands-on skills that carve the path to professional success. This realisation is rooted in the shifting sands of the job market, where the currency of skills has never been more vital. Why Employers Are Betting on Skills vs Certificates Immediate Value and Reduced Ramp-Up Time Employers are increasingly pursuing candidates who can leap into action with minimal hand-holding. The appeal of skill-based hiring is clear: such candidates often require less orientation and training, translating to quicker contributions to company goals. In a world where change is the only constant, the ability to learn and adapt is king. Employers treasure candidates who showcase current competencies, the potential for growth, and the agility to navigate through an ever-evolving technological landscape. Degrees may suggest a level of proficiency, but skills\u2014demonstrated through practical work, such as portfolios or specific project experiences\u2014provide concrete evidence of what a candidate can do.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the question of whether online certifications are as valuable as traditional degrees has taken center stage. As technology continues to reshape industries, education has not remained untouched. The emergence of online certifications, often touted for their accessibility and affordability, presents a compelling alternative to traditional degree programs. But are these certifications truly on par with traditional degrees in terms of value and credibility? Let's delve into the factors that contribute to this ongoing debate. The Rise of Online Certifications Online certifications have gained significant traction in recent years, driven by the growing demand for flexible and targeted learning. Unlike traditional degree programs, which typically span several years, online certifications can be completed in a matter of weeks or months. This condensed timeframe allows learners to acquire specific skills or knowledge quickly, making them attractive to both professionals seeking to upskill and individuals looking to pivot their careers. Platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and edX have capitalized on this trend, offering a wide range of courses taught by industry experts and esteemed university professors. The appeal lies not only in the convenience of learning from home but also in the ability to choose courses that align directly with one's career goals. For many, online certifications offer a fast track to acquiring in-demand skills without the time and financial commitment required by traditional degree programs. The Value Proposition: Skills Over Degrees The debate over the value of online certifications versus traditional degrees often centers around the perceived credibility and recognition of these credentials.

The importance of degrees and skills is reevaluated as employers seek a balance between traditional qualifications and practical abilities. It's time to address the evolving needs of the future job market, where you may need more than being a degree holder to secure your desired position in your field. In the past, degrees were seen as the ultimate ticket to success. However, we now understand that skills are equally crucial in shaping career paths. Employers are increasingly looking beyond academic achievements and seeking candidates with practical expertise and adaptability. So, how can you navigate this new reality?

Redefining Talent: The Shift Towards Skills In today's ever-evolving job market, talent is no longer solely defined by academic achievements. Employers are increasingly recognizing the value of practical skills over theoretical knowledge. This shift towards skills as the new currency in determining employability has reshaped how organizations evaluate and hire candidates. Talent Goes Beyond Academic Achievements Gone are the days when a college degree was considered the ultimate measure of one's talent.

Find Your Perfect School Key Takeaways: If you\u2019re considering higher education, you may have some concerns about what it\u2019s going to cost you. With most students graduating with nearly $30,000 in student loan debt, it\u2019s natural to consider whether or not your investment of tuition dollars will pay off in the future.

These expenses often change from year to year and can vary based on where you attend school, your enrollment status, and how much financial aid you receive, if any.

That means 13 million students pursue their future careers by obtaining an education at one of these institutions each year. These programs will go on to graduate about 25% of all the first-time, full-time students that take classes each year. The two-year college is a vital pathway toward the more advanced educational opportunities that a four-year university offers. Students receive access to enhanced employment opportunities with this choice as well. By earning an associate\u2019s degree, it is possible to advance toward a better job or the eventual bachelor\u2019s degree that someone desires. Most programs require at least two years, but less than four years of full-time college work. A 4-year university provides a larger institution for students to gain an accredited degree. Universities are different than colleges because of their size and potential availability of graduate programs. Some might have a medical or a law school that allows for the pursuit of a professional degree. Community colleges can get students started on that process, but they can\u2019t lead to a completion of them. There are several additional 2-year college vs. 4-year university pros and cons worth considering as well. List of the Pros of a 2-Year College vs. a 4-Year University 1.

Eighth graders take the PSAT to be evaluated for college readiness, to see scholarship opportunities and to prepare for taking the SAT. College Board even hosts college information nights at middle schools to share tips for improving PSAT and SAT scores prior to the junior year of high school. Being prepared for college is a great idea - we should absolutely ensure our children understand the ins and outs of attaining a college degree. But is a college degree always worth it? Here are three reasons why a college degree should not be the only career path recommended to our students: 1. A 2015 survey found that the most important reasons students choose to pursue a four-year degree is for a high-paying job. Obviously, financial security is a priority for the majority of us and college is seen as the primary way to find that stability. Yet only 59 percent of those entering college will earn a bachelor\u2019s degree within 6 years, and many of them will graduate with a nice chunk of student debt. In fact, one in four Americans owe student debt, which currently totals $1.5 trillion. The average student debt is over $37,000 and climbing \u2014 a number that seems low to many.

We have also discussed the decreasing value of college degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Best Alternatives to a 4-Year College.\u00a0 In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on alternatives to traditional four-year college degrees due to several factors. One major reason is the rising cost of higher education, which has led many individuals to seek more affordable options. Additionally, the job market\u2019s evolving nature demands a broader range of skills and competencies, prompting a shift towards alternative pathways such as vocational training, apprenticeships, and online certifications.\u00a0 However, it\u2019s essential to acknowledge the lasting benefits of a four-year college degree. Beyond providing specialized knowledge in a particular field, a bachelor\u2019s degree often cultivates critical thinking, communication, and problem-solving skills that are valuable across various professions. Moreover, a college education opens doors to a broader range of career opportunities and typically leads to higher earning potential over the long term. In fact, there are easy college degrees that are quite high paying as well.\u00a0 It is interesting to note that Liberal Arts is one of the easiest 4 year degrees to get. However, Liberal Arts is also one of the most useless associate degrees if you want high-paying jobs.\u00a0 Moreover, data from the Burning Glass Institute highlights a decline in jobs requiring a college education, dropping from 51% in 2017 to 44% in 2021. Similarly, Gallup reports a stark decline in the percentage of young adults viewing college education as \u201cvery important,\u201d plummeting from 74% to 41% within six years.\u00a0 C",

Attending college can be a helpful starting point when you're interested in deepening your knowledge and strengthening your skills, but earning a degree isn\u2019t the only path toward career success. In fact, there are plenty of ways to qualify for jobs without immediately pursuing a bachelor\u2019s degree. In this article, we\u2019ll explore nine alternatives to the traditional four-year college experience, including ways to start earning money quickly, build job-specific skills, and attain career credentials over time. 9 alternatives to college Whether you're interested in more affordable and flexible ways to earn a college degree, or you're interested in other kinds of opportunities to develop your skill set without attending college, we've compiled nine ways to get started. 1. Enter the workforce. It\u2019s becoming increasingly common for companies to ease or eliminate their education requirements for job candidates, particularly in the high-paying tech industry. Many jobs, like web developer or project coordinator, now don\u2019t require a college degree. If you demonstrate that you have the right job skills, you may already qualify for entry-level positions. It can help to search for jobs that don\u2019t include an education requirement. However, if you meet most of the remaining requirements, it may be worth applying for the role anyway. Some surveys suggest that hiring managers will consider hiring candidates who meet half of their stated requirements, particularly if they can train employees in the areas where they\u2019re less skilled. Read job descriptions for the roles you are interested in, and take note of the skills mentioned. Then, use those",

Here Are Top 9 Alternative Paths For many high school graduates, the traditional path of pursuing a four-year college degree has long been considered the default route to a successful career. However, the landscape of education is evolving, and numerous alternatives are gaining traction, offering diverse opportunities for students with varying goals and preferences. The escalating cost of college education and the looming burden of student loan debt have spurred a shift in perspectives, prompting many to explore alternative pathways. Monica Jones, a college and career readiness coach at Frederick Douglass High School in Kentucky, notes, \"Some students have no desire to pursue a four-year college education but recognize that the opportunity to pursue high-paying careers still exists with alternative routes.\" A report from YouScience, based on survey data from over 500 students nationally who graduated high school between 2020 and 2023, reveals a significant trend. Approximately 55% of respondents from the class of 2023 opted for alternative routes instead of pursuing a traditional four-year college degree. 1. Earn an Associate Degree A compelling alternative is the pursuit of an associate degree, with over a quarter of 2023 high school graduates choosing this option. Community colleges provide a cost-effective and quicker pathway compared to traditional universities. An associate degree not only offers affordability but also leads to lucrative career opportunities, with graduates earning more than those holding only a high school diploma.

Could anyone share their thoughts on why this might be the majority choice? 4 months ago Sure, there are a few key factors that might contribute to the popularity of a traditional, four-year college experience. Firstly, exposure and societal expectations. From a young age, we're often presented with university as a goal after high school. Culturally, it's a mark of achievement. This view permeates our society, from media portrayals to high school curriculums, making it a default path for many students. Additionally, the college provides opportunities to gain a comprehensive education in a chosen field. It allows students to delve deeply into an academic discipline and attain a high level of expertise, which can be advantageous in a job market that often values specialized skill sets. The social aspects of college should not be overlooked either. These years are often seen as formative. College introduces many students to new ideologies, perspectives, and people that they may not encounter otherwise, contributing to personal growth. Finally, many future employers still favor a traditional degree. Despite discussions about skill-based hiring, many jobs list a bachelor's degree as a requirement.

The new foundational skills of the modern economy include greater digital savvy, increased business acumen, and more versatile human and team-centered workplace competencies. These skills generate substantial salary premiums for the students and workers who master them, and demand for these skills is large and growing at all levels of educational attainment. Middle and high schools\u00a0that embrace these skills will be setting their students up for future success. However, the nature and prevalence of education in these new foundational skills during middle and high school is unclear. In this report, American Student Assistance and Burning Glass Technologies present the view from the schoolhouse: What is the value that students can gain from mastering these new foundational skills, how do educators understand the value to students that these skills offer, and how do educators feel about the quality of education in these skills that their schools provide.

                  "raw_content": "Site Search Teens Turning Away from Traditional College Paths Due to Trades Opportunities In recent years, a significant shift has emerged in teenagers' attitudes toward higher education. More and more teens are questioning the traditional four-year college route, opting instead for alternative educational pathways that promise lucrative careers without the burden of massive student debt. This blog explores the reasons behind this trend, the benefits of skilled trades, and the evolving landscape of education in America. The College Conundrum The traditional narrative around higher education has long been that a four-year degree is essential for a successful career. However, mounting evidence suggests that this belief is losing its grip. According to a recent report from NBC Philadelphia, 49% of teens believe that a high school diploma, trade program, or two-year degree is sufficient for their future careers. This marks a significant shift in mindset, as young people increasingly recognize the limitations of the conventional college experience. The Financial Burden of College One of the most pressing issues for teens considering college is the staggering cost of tuition. With student loan debt in the U.S. surpassing $1.7 trillion, many are reconsidering whether the investment is worth it. The Public Policy Institute of California reports that while graduation rates at four-year institutions are improving, many students still do not finish their degrees in the expected timeframe. At California State University, for instance, only 36% of students graduate within four years, and about 62% complete their degrees within six years. These statistics highlight a critical flaw in the traditional education model: the uncertainty of return on investment. Many students are in debt with little guarantee of a high-paying job upon graduation. Rising Interest in Skilled Trades Amidst this financial uncertainty, skilled trades are emerging as a viable alternative to college. Professions such as electricians, plumbers, and wind tur",

A growing proportion of high school students think they need to continue their education after they earn their diploma, and the jobs that offer them the best chance at living a comfortable life increasingly require training after high school. But that postsecondary education is less likely to involve enrolling at a four-year college and earning a bachelor\u2019s degree. So how have K-12 schools been changing in response?

Americans today have less confidence in institutions of higher education than they did even less than a decade ago, according to regular tracking by the polling firm Gallup. Another Gallup survey in 2021 found that, even if there were no obstacles, only a slim majority of parents, 54 percent, preferred that their children pursue a four-year college education.

While gap years are considered common practice for new high school graduates in many countries abroad, more and more students and colleges in the United States are seeing the benefits of taking a gap year between high school and college. Gap years are now widely recognized as an effective way for young people to grow, learn, and better prepare for higher education and beyond. So what exactly are gap years, and how do they impact college success?\u00a0 Gap year statistics collected over the past decade show us that students taking a break from the traditional high-school-to-college pipeline tend to have greater self-confidence, increased personal awareness, improved communication skills, better mental health, and a higher rate of success as undergraduates than those who do not. Let's explore how gap years can positively impact college success, and what factors students should consider when planning their own gap year experience.

From Joe O\u2019Shea\u2019s book, Gap Year: How Delaying College Changes People in Ways the World Needs: \u201cSome studies have looked at the academic performance of gap year students while in college. In Australia and the United Kingdom, economic researchers found that high school students who deferred their admission to college to take a Gap Year went to college (after their gap year) at the same rate as those who accepted an offer and intended to go straight there (Birch and Miller 2007; Crawford and Cribb 2012). They also found that taking a gap year had a significant positive impact on students\u2019 academic performance in college, with the strongest impact for students who had applied to college with grades on the lower end of the distribution (Birch and Miller 2007; Crawford and Cribb 2012).\u201d In fact, in the United Kingdom and in the United States, students who had taken a Gap Year were more likely to graduate with higher grade point averages than observationally identical individuals who went straight to college, and this effect was seen even for gap year students with lower academic achievement in high school (Crawford and Cribb 2012, Clagett 2013). 2020 National Alumni Survey Following the highly successful 2015 National Alumni Survey, the Gap Year Association commissioned the efforts of Kempie Blythe, MA, and reprising her role from the 2015 survey, Nina Hoe Gallagher, PhD, as well as the GYA Research Committee, to complete the 2020 Gap Year Alumni Survey.

Their journeys defy conventional wisdom and inspire countless others to pursue their dreams. Let\u2019s take a look at incredibly successful people who didn\u2019t follow the traditional educational route. Steve Jobs image credit: ZorroGabriel/Shutterstock Steve Jobs, co-founder of Apple Inc., revolutionized the technology industry without a college degree. After dropping out of Reed College, he launched Apple from his garage. His visionary approach led to the creation of iconic products like the iPhone and iPad. Bill Gates Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, left Harvard University to pursue his passion for software development. Under his leadership, Microsoft became a global tech giant. Gates is now a philanthropist, focusing on global health and education through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

I could really use some positivity! 4 months ago Absolutely, it's important to remember that while college can be a great path for many, it isn't the only path to success. There's a wide array of individuals who have achieved great things without a traditional college education. One such individual is Richard Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, which comprises over 400 companies. Branson struggled with dyslexia and dropped out of school at 16, but this didn't deter him from launching his first business: a mail-order record company called \"Virgin\". This grew into a record store, then a recording studio, and slowly but surely into the extensive conglomerate it is today. On another front, Ellen DeGeneres, a beloved talk show host and comedian, never attended college. She held a series of jobs - from waiting tables, to house painting, to oyster shucking - before she began performing stand-up comedy in coffee houses. She eventually scored her own sitcom and later, a massively popular daytime talk show, proving that there isn't a single path to success in the entertainment industry.

Many find their calling through self-education, passion, drive, and an undeterred will to succeed against the odds. Within this narrative lie the stories of tenacious individuals who, without formal degrees, have carved their own paths and achieved monumental success. As we explore the tales of ten college dropouts who made it big, it\u2019s necessary to reflect on the qualities and strategies that fueled their ascensions\u2014illuminating a different angle to personal development and showing that often, real-world experience, personal conviction, and continuous learning form the bedrock of genuine achievement. The Unconventional Path: Learning Beyond the Classroom Steve Jobs\u2019s journey is a testament to how a clear vision and pursuit of perfection can revolutionize global industries. Dropping out of Reed College after just six months, Jobs didn\u2019t immediately set off on a path to success. He spent months sleeping on friends\u2019 floors, returning Coke bottles for food money, and attending creative classes that interested him. These experiences, especially a course on calligraphy, later influenced Apple\u2019s approach to typography and design. Harvard University couldn\u2019t hold Bill Gates for long; he dropped out to pursue his dream of writing software for the emerging market of personal computers. Gates\u2019s story underlines the importance of recognizing opportunities and seizing them with both hands. Without his decision to put theory into practice in the real world, the technology landscape today might look very different.

Edition 1st Edition First Published 2019 Imprint Routledge Pages 32 eBook ISBN 9781315678924 Share ABSTRACT This chapter discusses the theoretical and empirical links between interests and work outcomes as well as the potential mechanisms for the relationships. It explains the vocational psychology literature on interests with the substantial literatures on job satisfaction, job performance, and career success from industrial and organizational psychology research. The chapter also discusses the importance of congruence in vocational interest theories before discussing the relationships between interests and work outcomes. Despite evidence contradicting the homogeneity assumption, there is substantial evidence that interests are related to occupational choice. Motivation is defined as the set of internal processes that directs, energizes, and sustains behavior over time. Given the influence of interests on occupational choice and their ability to direct attention and focus effort on relevant job-related tasks, vocational interests should also be related to both declarative and procedural job knowledge. One direction for future research is to examine the psychological mechanisms underlying the relationships between interest congruence and important work outcomes.

Building upon the insights from the earlier publication, \u201cEmpowering Choices: A Framework for Measuring and Maximizing the Impact of Professional Choices,\u201d the study delves into the multifaceted factors that contribute to these emotions and introduces an innovative approach to career and education decision-making. The paper presents the findings of an experimental approach to career advice, where participants were encouraged to envision a life without financial constraints and express their lifelong passions. The research suggests that aligning career choices with one\u2019s passions and interests can lead to heightened job satisfaction, improved overall well-being, and greater overall success. By referencing the earlier publication, we emphasize the continuity and evolution of our research efforts in this paper.

But is that the best choice? For many seniors, college selection is the most daunting and significant part of the final year of high school. The application process is time consuming, and the time spent waiting for responses from chosen schools anxiety-inducing. But apart from the nuts and bolts of application and acceptance, there is another factor at play: the underlying social pressure that values college \u201cprestige.\u201d College prestige culture is not new. Throughout our society, the most exclusive and distinguished institutions of higher education have become synonymous with success. Indeed, we have created an entire \u201cleague\u201d of schools that are considered to be the most desirable to attend. The reasons for this are numerous, and sometimes justified. Mr. Peter Johnson, a college advisor at Jesuit, stated that while \u201cprestige\u201d is in the eye of the beholder, \u201cPursuing prestigious, highly selective institutions could be an expectation of high quality of faculty, surrounding the student with a high quality peer group, it can be based upon academic qualifications or expect",

Sadly, this vital part of what makes society unique and interesting is slowly being suffocated in the schooling system. As we consider the children to be the future of our world, let\u2019s consider the role that the schooling system has on helping them reach their full creative potential\u2014and how they are currently missing the mark. The Current Education System The current education system does little to foster creativity. Let\u2019s consider two major aspects of the system that dampen and leave little room for curious minds to be inspired. Lack of Creativity in Education While it\u2019s clear that many people are born naturally creative, the fact is that creativity can be nurtured and encouraged in the right environment. Education systems often lack creativity, stifling students\u2019 imagination and innovation skills. This is due to a rigid curriculum that values memorization over creative thinking.\u00a0To fix this, educational institutes must create an atmosphere that values and nurtures creativity. It could improve in the following ways. Teachers should give project-based learning and open-ended assignments for students to explore multiple solutions. By granting students freedom to express their ideas and think critically, we can unleash their creative potential. To boost creativity in education, art and music should be incorporated into the curriculum. These subjects allow students to think creatively and explore various forms of expression. Incorporating art into subjects like science and math helps students comprehend abstract concepts and hone problem-solving skills. Technology also plays an essential role in promoting creativity. Virtual reality experiences, gamified learning platforms, and multimedia presentations provide interactive ways for students to learn and express their ideas.

In a typical Western education system, results indicated that \u201csince 1990, even as IQ scores have risen, creative thinking scores have significantly decreased\u201d. Traditional education does not sufficiently value innovative and entrepreneurial thinking \u2013 our system even dumbs down the creative genius that we were born with, according to a test developed by NASA. Yet creative skills and mindsets are indispensable in a workforce that must be responsive to change and capable of finding new solutions to complex problems. The World Economic Forum itself has identified social abilities such as coordinating with others and persuasion, as well as complex problem-solving skills, as essential in the knowledge-based workplace of the near future. We live in the times of autonomous cars, reusable rockets and artificial intelligence, yet we are still teaching in an education system that was set up for factory workers some 200 years ago. What we should be doing instead is to focus on skill-building and setting any learner \u2013 be it in compulsory education or in lifelong learning \u2013 up for success. Entrepreneurial education as solution Entrepreneurial education teaches the important skills of innovative and creative thinking, helping people develop a flexible \u201cgrowth mindset\u201d that can adapt to new problems. It is not about teaching business skills such as accounting and pitching, but what it means to be entrepreneurial \u2013 what mindset does an entrepreneur have, how does she stay motivated, how does she solve problems, and get people to see and follow her vision?

Range vs. Specialization: Why Exploring Diverse Career Paths is Key to Success When I was 12 years old, I was inspired to become a surgeon after reading the book \"Gifted Hands\" by Dr. Ben Carson. This story isn't peculiar to me - in fact, it was a catalyst for a lot of Nigerians that became interested in pursuing a career in medicine. As a result, when I moved to the States for college, I majored in Biology with a Pre-medicine concentration. It was a given - my path was defined. However, all that changed in my senior year of college after I won first place in an entrepreneurship competition. This led to the creation of a sexual health public heath nonprofit (The ARISE Africa FDN) in Nigeria and it exposed me to other paths in healthcare. I came to the realization that becoming a doctor was not the only path to making a difference in the lives of others. In addition, my foray into a leadership role also illuminated the significant role of business in driving change and ensuring sustainable impact. Prior to this experience, my worldview was limited and that also limited my perspective on the diverse career paths that were available and ways to impact individuals in the health field. Having this first hand experience also provided me the opportunity to connect with mentors, who eventually advised me to expand my skillset and pursue a graduate degree in Business. And that was how my medical dreams ended. However, it wasn't so simple - there were lifestyle and financial limitations as an international student that contributed to this career swerve. As predicted, getting an MBA further expanded my option and ultimately led me to a career in tech as a Business Analyst. While I'm fortunate to still work in the healthcare sector, the courage to explore different paths eventually led me to a role that sometimes feels like it was curated just for me.

The study also explores key trends in the economic outcomes of young adults among those who have and have not completed a four-year college degree. The analysis in this report is based on three data sources. The labor force, earnings, hours, household income and poverty characteristics come from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Annual Social and Economic Supplement of the Current Population Survey.

Many professionals cite \u201cthe ability to make more money\u201d as the motivating factor behind why they chose to pursue a college degree. But does earning a college degree\u00a0actually\u00a0lead to a higher salary? And if so, how much higher? Is the increase in pay ultimately\u00a0worth it\u2014worth the time, effort, and money spent earning it? The short answer is: Yes! Advancing in your education does typically lead to higher annual and lifetime earnings, at all levels of education. Below, we explore the average salary earned at each educational level so you can better understand your current earning potential and make a smarter decision as to whether or not earning a college degree makes sense for you.

Key Takeaways The evidence that a college degree significantly improves one\u2019s employment prospects and earnings potential is overwhelming. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders are half as likely to be unemployed as their peers whose highest degree is a high school diploma and they make $1.2 million in additional earnings over their lifetime.1,2 Analyzing outcomes data from over 30 million students, a group of economists also found public universities offer the greatest upward economic mobility. Bolstered Prospects Two-thirds of bachelor\u2019s degrees in the United States are awarded by public universities.3 College-educated workers enjoy a substantial earnings premium. On an annual basis, median earnings for bachelor\u2019s degree holders are $40,500 or 86 percent higher than those whose highest degree is a high school diploma.4 The earnings gap between college graduates and those with less education continues to widen. In 2023, median income for recent graduates reached $60,000 a year for bachelor\u2019s degree holders aged 22\u201327. For high school graduates the same age, median earnings are $36,000 a year.5 Eighty-seven percent of bachelor\u2019s degree holders report financial wellbeing, 20 percentage points higher than groups with any other level of education.6 Recent college graduates also weathered the Great Recession far better than their peers with a high school diploma. Today, the jobless rate for bachelor\u2019s degree holders is less than 3 percent.7 And the incidence of poverty among bachelor\u2019s degree holders is 3.5 times lower than it is for those who hold high school degrees.8 A college education is expected to become even more valuable. Over the past decade, all net job growth has gone to workers with bachelor\u2019s degree or graduate degrees.9 Additional Benefits to Graduates Of course, a college education is about more than just securing a job and a steady income.

College Board * January 2, 2017 NEW YORK \u2014 Individuals with higher education levels earn more, pay more taxes, and are more likely than others to be employed and to have job benefits such as retirement and health insurance. Adults with more education are also more likely to move up the socioeconomic ladder and less likely to rely on public assistance, according to Education Pays 2016, the latest report from the College Board\u2019s Trends in Higher Education series. Updated triennially since 2004, Education Pays: The Benefits of Higher Education for Individuals and Society documents differences in the earnings and employment patterns of U.S. adults with different levels of education. The report also establishes a correlation between education and health outcomes, community involvement, and indicators of the well-being of the next generation. In addition to documenting median earnings by education level, this year\u2019s report also includes data on variation in earnings by different characteristics such as gender, race/ethnicity, occupation, college major, and institutional sector. \u201cAlthough obtaining a college degree can mean forgone wages during a time when they are also paying tuition, by age 34 the average bachelor\u2019s degree recipient will have recouped those costs,\u201d explains Jennifer Ma, senior policy research scientist at",

When it comes to return on investment (ROI), not all degrees are considered equal. This article exposes eight college degrees with poor ROI.

One type of job popular among high school graduates is retail or customer service. This includes roles at department stores, coffee shops, restaurants, and other businesses.

As a high school senior, I'm curious about the types of jobs I'll be able to qualify for once I graduate. What kinds of positions are generally available to high school grads? 2 months ago High school graduates can often find positions in a variety of fields, typically in roles that are entry-level or require less specialized skill sets, but this can vary widely depending on your specific interests or prior work/volunteer experience. In the sales and retail sectors, roles like sales representatives, cashiers, or customer service representatives are common. In these jobs, you'll likely interact regularly with customers, so they're a good fit if you're personable and handle stress well. In the food service industry, jobs include waitstaff, baristas, and food prep workers. These roles require good communication and customer service skills, as well as the ability to work in a fast-paced environment. Administrative and support roles, such as receptionists, office clerks, and administrative assistants, are also commonly available to high school graduates. These roles often involve tasks like answering phones, organizing files, and scheduling appointments. Maintenance and labor jobs, like custodial staff, movers, and warehouse workers, often don't require a degree, but they may require physical stamina and, in some cases, specialized knowledge or skills.

The rise of online learning platforms, coding boot camps, and self-directed learning has made it possible for individuals to acquire highly specialized skills without officially going to college and getting a degree in that field. \u00a0This has sparked a debate about whether prioritizing skill development over a college degree is more effective as a recruitment strategy. This article discusses the differences between focusing on skill development and having a college degree and the advantages each approach offers. The Case for Skill Development Skills are abilities and expertise that are directly relevant to performing tasks effectively. These include both technical and soft skills, which can be developed outside of the academic setting. Some people argue that hands-on skills matter more than just fancy degrees. They argue that someone who has practical experience in the field \u2013 and therefore the necessary skills \u2013 offer more value for companies than someone who has a degree that focused more on theory. Many professionals nowadays focus on skill development through online courses, workshops, and hands-on experiences. This approach to professional development is not exclusive to those without a college degree. Many diploma-holders do this to shift to a career that\u2019s different from what they studied. Skills development courses also allow individuals to stay current with industry trends and technologies, making them more adaptable and immediately valuable to employers. The Benefits of Skills-Based Hiring Focusing on practical skills during recruitment offers several advantages: Enhanced Job Performance: Candidates with proven skills are often better equipped to perform their roles effectively from day one. This can lead to higher productivity and quicker onboarding. Increased Diversity: Hiring based on skills can open doors for candidates from non-traditional backgrounds who may not have f",

SNS | New Delhi | October 29, 2021 5:42 pm (Representational Image: iStock) Colleges have been in existence for ages. Right from the advent of humanity, colleges have been a go-to place to learn, acquire knowledge and get exposure to the outside world. Generations have spent the first third of their lives in colleges to acquire a degree and create a bright future ahead. However, the world as we see it today isn\u2019t the same as it was two decades ago. The degrees obtained were the only proof of eligibility to get placement in the industry, which of course is no longer true. According to the facts, around 3.7 Cr students are enrolled in higher education (Source: 2019 Aishe.nic.in report) across multiple degrees and colleges. Although the number of jobs rolled out and the so-called successes measures is less than 10% i.e., not even 37 Lacs students are getting jobs after completing their degrees. This represents the future of work will not be just about college degrees and qualifications. Advertisement With the emergence of the gig economy, the nature of work is more about skills. Given the estimates of the World Economic Forum \u2013 more than 1 billion jobs, almost one-third of all jobs worldwide are likely to be transformed by technology in the coming decade. The accelerated digital adoption has already made this happen. For instance \u2013 the conventional way of buying groceries, ordering medicines and other essential items have already transformed and become digital. Now even small stores or retailers are moving to app-based businesses to increase their customer base and retain the existing ones. Th",

School and university students have long sought after placements, volunteer work and part-time jobs to introduce them to the professional world and help them decide what line of work to pursue after their studies. Students need to actively shape their careers as early as possible. An important part of this is securing work experience that not only looks good on their CVs but also helps develop the employability skills that employers are looking for. Students who don\u2019t have work experience are unlikely to receive job offers Work placements come in many forms: from paid and unpaid internships to volunteer work and part-time work. Any work experience undertaken by students carries value in terms of skill development and enhancing career prospects and career planning. It exposes students to the pace of professional life, provides the information and insights that can assist in choosing career paths, introduces them to the attributes required in working life and offers them a chance to take on new levels of responsibility. Work experience is often just as important as a degree, with research from 2013 by High Fliers indicating that students without work experience are unlikely to be offered a job. Work experience not only benefits hopeful job seekers but employers too The job market has always been perceived as competitive, however, 2017 presents graduates with a fiercely more competitive landscape than ever before. Work experience twenty years ago served the purpose of offering young people a taster of different career paths and adding weight to a CV. Today, it is also a means for employers to identify and recruit talent. By offering students (from as early as their first year) short-term work placements, organisations can determine whether candidates are suitable for a role.

We focus on one core individual resource, work values, and assess its contribution to early career trajectory dynamics among a cohort of Millennials between the ages of 18\u201335 and years 2005 through 2019. Using eight waves of the Transition to Adulthood Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we consider how extrinsic and intrinsic work values predict both cumulative occupational and employer changes as well as observed annual earnings and occupational prestige trajectories. Extrinsic work values are highly predictive of employment change and destination. However, results vary significantly by educational attainment and sex, as extrinsic work values are associated with contrasting outcomes depending on whether respondents have a college degree, while the bulk of benefits of returns to work values are found for men. The current paper sheds light on the critical dynamics of early career mobility processes.

Some might even decide that furthering their education is not the right choice. When you begin to look at what the long-term implications of your choice in this matter will be, then it becomes even more challenging to make. Should you be going to a trade school? Or would attending a four-year traditional college or university be the best option? You could even opt for an online degree or decide to take a year off, find a job, and then re-evaluate whether or not college is right for you. The truth here is hard to accept sometimes: every choice is one that offers viable options. If you decide to go to a technical college, then you can receive an advanced education and skill-building opportunities that might get you into a high-paying job faster with less student debt.

Should you invest four or more years in college, or is a shorter, hands-on trade school program the better option? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive comparison to help you decide. What Is Trade School and How Does It Differ from College? Definition of Trade School Trade schools, also known as vocational or technical schools, provide specialized training for hands-on careers. Programs typically range from 6 months to 2 years and are designed to equip students with practical skills for HVAC, cosmetology, healthcare, and more. The curriculum is focused on real-world applications, preparing graduates to enter the workforce quickly. Overview of a Traditional College Education In contrast, a traditional college education usually spans 4 or more years and includes a broad academic curriculum. Students must complete general education courses in addition to their major-specific studies, often focusing on theoretical knowledge and critical thinking skills.

For instance: In comparison, college graduates\u2019 salaries can vary widely: Long-Term Earning Potential It\u2019s true that, on average, college graduates earn more over a lifetime. However, this largely depends on the career path. Skilled trades like electrical work or dental hygiene can lead to salaries that rival or even surpass those of some college-educated careers.

While both avenues offer opportunities for learning and skill development, apprenticeships provide distinct advantages that cater to different learning styles and career aspirations. Here are some key benefits of apprenticeships over traditional education: Apprenticeships: Apprenticeships emphasize practical, hands-on experience from day one. Apprentices work directly in their chosen field, gaining valuable skills under the mentorship of experienced professionals. This immersive learning environment allows apprentices to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, enhancing their understanding and proficiency. Traditional Education: Traditional education often focuses on theoretical knowledge imparted through lectures, textbooks, and assignments. While this foundation is crucial, practical application may come later through internships or entry-level positions, depending on the program. Apprenticeships: Apprenticeships are tailored to specific industries and job roles, providing targeted skill development aligned with industry needs. Apprentices learn industry-specific techniques, technologies, and best practices directly applicable to their career paths. This focused training enhances job readiness and increases employability upon program completion. Traditional Education: Traditional education offers a broader academic curriculum that may include theoretical knowledge across various subjects. While it provides a comprehensive understanding of concepts and principles, graduates may require additional training or experience to transition smoothly into specific roles within their chosen field.

                  "raw_content": "What are the Key Differences Between Apprenticeships and Traditional Education? For many, the journey toward a stable career often begins with the question of which educational path to take. Traditional education routes, such as college or university programs, have long been a go-to choice. However, apprenticeships present an increasingly appealing alternative, particularly for those seeking hands-on experience and an immediate entry into the workforce. Let\u2019s look at some key differences between apprenticeships and traditional education and explore the unique benefits of each. 1. Earning While Learning One of the standout advantages of apprenticeships is the ability to earn an income while gaining skills. Traditional education often requires students to take on student loans, relying on financial aid or part-time jobs to support themselves during their studies. In contrast, apprenticeships provide a paycheck, allowing individuals to learn on the job without accumulating debt. For instance, in skilled trades like manufacturing, plumbing, or electrical work, apprentices are paid as they complete their training. This model not only makes apprenticeships financially accessible but also gives apprentices a taste of real-world financial responsibility. 2. Practical, Hands-On Experience While traditional education emphasizes theory and knowledge-building, apprenticeships prioritize hands-on experience. Apprentices are trained by experienced mentors and spend much of their time actively practicing their skills in a real-world setting. This immediate application of knowledge helps apprentices develop a solid skill set directly applicable to their careers. In fields where technical proficiency is essential\u2014such as construction or advanced manufacturing\u2014learning by doing can make all the difference. An apprenticeship graduate often enters the workforce with a level of practical experience that can take years to build through traditional education. 3.

One such form is apprenticeships. Apprenticeships offer a unique learning experience that combines on-the-job training with classroom instruction. Apprentices work alongside experienced professionals in their chosen field, gaining invaluable hands-on experience while earning a wage. Classroom instruction provides theoretical knowledge to complement practical skills gained on the job. One of the major advantages of apprenticeships is that they provide a direct pathway into employment. This means that upon completion of an apprenticeship, individuals already have valuable work experience and are often offered full-time employment within their company or industry. Another advantage is the flexibility of apprenticeships. They can be done at any age, regardless of whether or not you hold a degree or other qualifications. This makes them accessible to anyone looking for a career change or wanting to upskill in their current field. Apprenticeships also offer many benefits beyond just employment opportunities and skill-building. They allow individuals to network with seasoned professionals in their chosen field, opening doors for future job opportunities and mentorship relationships. Furthermore, unlike traditional schooling where students accumulate debt, apprentices earn money while they learn. The cost of tuition is usually covered by the employer or government funding agencies which means less financial burden on the individual. The success stories from those who have completed apprenticeships are numerous; it\u2019s easy to see why so many people choose this path over conventional schooling. Take Jamie Oliver for example: he started his culinary journey as an apprentice chef at Neal Street Restaurant before rising through ranks to become one of Britain\u2019s",

Trade schools are also known as technical-vocational schools. These are post-secondary colleges that offer skills-centric, job-focused training for skilled professions. Their training programs combine classroom instruction and practical skills training. These professions are in a wide range of disciplines, too. Think from aviation technology to zoological maintenance. The hands-on experiences occur in laboratories, workspaces, and workplaces. Laboratories can be physical facilities and virtual spaces. Apprenticeships and internships are common, too. Students learn the specific technical skills that their future jobs demand. Plumbing students learn pipe installation and repair and plumbing schematics. Aspiring electricians learn electrical wiring and circuitry and blueprint reading.

That\u2019s a whopping $500,000 over a 30-year career. However, college isn\u2019t the best fit for everyone due to rising costs and other drawbacks. Trade schools offer a compelling alternative. They provide specialized training and direct career pathways, and are often focused on high paying jobs that are not typically trained for at four year universities.

The rising concern of investing in trade school over college is shocking the society. Let\u2019s look at the reality of the world of higher education. The cost of learning from a typical college, be it public or private, is increasing so steadily and continuously that aids and scholarships aren\u2019t making any significant difference. Besides, the four-year degree program doesn\u2019t usually take four years. Recent research shows the many students enrolled in the four-year degree program take up to six years to complete it.

According to recent research, student debts for forty-four million Americans have reached an all-time high of $1.9 trillion. A solution to this crisis is to learn, hone, and practice a particular skill trade. That is where trade schools come in. What Is a Trade School? A trade school is a vocational educational institute, focused on teaching the student a particular skill set. This razor-sharp focus reduces classroom time when eliminating irrelevant courses. These schools offer a wide range of courses to pick from. You can select the most relevant ones for your chosen career path. 9 Statistics to Consider 1. Estimated 56% Savings in the Price of Education An average bachelor\u2019s degree for four years costs as much as $147,200 in tuition and fee alone. In contrast, spending two or fewer years at a trade college, after accounting for grants and scholarships, can cost from $4,000 to $15,000 per year. That means a trade college degree can cost you up to $40,000. The difference of nearly 56% between both the costs is staggering. You will be saving $107,000 in just the cost of the degree, if not more. 2. Lower Debts The next important concern is the debts that the student incurs during their study.

Should you invest four or more years in college, or is a shorter, hands-on trade school program the better option? Let\u2019s dive into a comprehensive comparison to help you decide. What Is Trade School and How Does It Differ from College? Definition of Trade School Trade schools, also known as vocational or technical schools, provide specialized training for hands-on careers. Programs typically range from 6 months to 2 years and are designed to equip students with practical skills for HVAC, cosmetology, healthcare, and more. The curriculum is focused on real-world applications, preparing graduates to enter the workforce quickly.

The\u00a0U.S. Department of Labor\u00a0defines an apprenticeship as \u201can industry-driven, high-quality career pathway where employers can develop and prepare their future workforce, and individuals can obtain paid work experience, classroom instruction, and a nationally-recognized, portable credential.\u201d Many see apprenticeships as a \u201cfast track\u201d to gain a relatively high-paying job while obtaining career-specific training, all without the requirement of a college degree. While there are many personal considerations that impact a person\u2019s choice to pursue an apprenticeship over a college education, the stark differences in terms of employment outlook, starting salary, and both upfront and continual costs of college versus apprenticeships likely make the latter seem attractive to a growing number of young adults in America.\u00a0 Apprenticeships: Input and Output During 2020, over 636,000 apprentices completed apprenticeship programs across the United States, and roughly 221,000 new apprentices began their apprenticeships (Department of Labor). These high levels of apprenticeship participation endured throughout the pandemic, only dipping slightly from pre-pandemic numbers in 2019, when 252,000 new apprentices began programs. Looking at the past decade, it is clear that apprenticeships are becoming increasingly popular because participation has grown dramatically. The Department of Labor has\u00a0reported\u00a0a 128 percent growth in new apprentices between 2009 and 2019. Likewise, over 12,000 new apprenticeship programs were put in place between 2014 and 2019.

Since money wages have rarely, if ever, fallen in the United States, this cost reset is effectively permanent, threatening margins and long-term growth. And this squeeze on labor is set to get worse as demographic headwinds intensify. Our methodology Our analysis is grounded in the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Occupational Outlook Handbook calculations and projections of current and future occupational employment from the latest dates available (2022\u00e2\u0080\u009332). Skilled-trades roles were selected based on frequent migration to other jobs or significant portions of the workforce entering retirement, along with extensive barriers to entry, slow career progression, and criticality to the advancement of public and private infrastructure (including clean-energy projects and advanced manufacturing). Comparing the most recent BLS net new job growth of skilled roles between 2022 and 2032 with the average annual job openings, there is an imbalance of 20 job openings for every one net new employee. In other words, for the 26,000 net new employees that are projected to fill these 12 roles, there will be an estimated 584,000 annual openings. For most roles, the number of program completions lags substantially behind the number of job openings (for example, construction laborers and helpers show 3,400 program completions versus 151,000 projected annual openings).

But are trade schools expensive? In this guide, we\u2019ll break down the cost of trade school, compare it to college, and explain why trade school can be a smart financial investment. How Much Does Trade School Cost? Average Tuition and Fees The cost of trade school programs varies depending on the field of study and program length. On average, trade school tuition ranges from $5,000 to $30,000. Here\u2019s a breakdown: In comparison, the average cost of a 4-year college degree can easily exceed $100,000 for tuition alone. The financial gap becomes even wider when you factor in the additional time spent in school. Factors That Influence Trade School Costs Additional Costs to Consider While tuition is the primary expense, there are other costs associated with trade school: Supplies and Materials Many trade school programs require students to purchase tools, uniforms, or specific materials. Here are a few examples: Certification and Exam Fees Certain fields require licensing or certification exams, which can add to the overall cost. For example: These fees are usually one-time investments that ensure job readiness and certification. Living Expenses Whether you attend trade school or college, you must budget for housing, transportation, and meals. However, trade school programs are shorter, meaning you\u2019ll likely spend less on living expenses compared to a 4-year college experience. For many students, this can make a significant financial difference. Financial Aid Options for Trade School Fortunately, there are several financial aid options available to trade school students.

Trade Schools and Traditional Colleges are excellent options for students who dream of achieving their lifelong careers someday. However, there are some differences that one must consider when choosing which one is right for them. One significant factor students consider when comparing trade schools to conventional colleges is the cost.\u00a0 Both trade school and traditional college are valuable educations, but they rank in different prices and benefits. The Education Data Statistics reports that in-state students\u2019 average tuition for one year at a four-year public college was more than $9,750. Put this into perspective: by comparison, private colleges averaged over $27,146 annually. The trade school option, on the other hand, is often much cheaper and takes less time. How do these trade schools compare costs to traditional colleges, and which is your better choice? Table of Contents Tuition Costs When discussing cost differences, tuition is the first thing that comes to mind. Traditional colleges, especially four-year universities, tend to charge more for tuition. Students who attend conventional college often go for at least four years or more, and the cost builds up over time. By contrast, trade schools only offer short courses in specific job skills. Tuition prices for trade schools are usually much more affordable due to program lengths that may last only one to two years. This makes trade school an affordable option for many students who wish to enter the workforce while taking as little debt as possible. Time to Complete the Program Another important consideration is the length of the program. Traditional colleges generally take four years for a student to complete their bachelor\u2019s degree, while some programs, such as engineering and medicine, take longer. This extended time in school also means more years of paying tuition, fees, and other expenses. On the other hand, a trade school specializes in specific skills and training that be",

Both trade schools and apprenticeships allow you to pursue fulfilling careers without having to go through the conventional 4-year college route. Whether you choose to attend a trade school or become an apprentice is a matter of preference. Let\u2019s first understand the basics about both. Definitions Trade Schools Trade schools are also known as vocational schools or technical colleges. They\u2019re a form of secondary school that gives you a more focused educational background than a traditional college. Enrolling in a trade school is a much faster option compared to a traditional college. You also don\u2019t need to learn subjects that don\u2019t fit your specific career goal. Trade school classes will take several months up to a few years to complete. In trade school, curriculums are structured and focused on specific fields. This means the abilities you\u2019ll learn are highly industry-relevant. Some trade schools also offer apprenticeships depending on your program. Trade schools are available for careers in construction, automotive technology, culinary arts, cosmetology, plumbing, healthcare, information technology, and more.\u00a0 These schools are often accredited, offering certification and licensing training. NOTE: To enter, you must be a state resident where you are applying for, and complete high school or get your GED. It may also be necessary to pass a placement exam.

The Truth About Attending a Trade School Instead of a 4-Year College The Truth About Attending a Trade School Instead of a 4-Year College When looking to further your education, there may be various options available - a trade school and a 4-year college being two of them. A 4-year college experience may not be the right way to go for some individuals, despite the possible stigma surrounding attending a trade school. However, there are some truths to know about furthering your education with a different option than four years at a traditional college. Difference in Length of Time1 Attending a trade school can take less time than attending a 4-year college. In most cases, the completion of a trade program takes two years or less. At a majority of colleges, bachelor's degree programs take up to four years to complete. Taking this into account, an individual can get a trade education in half the amount of time it would take to complete an education at a 4-year college. Cost Difference1 The odds of a trade school tuition being lower than a 4-year college's tuition is usually fairly high, depending on what school you attend. However, due to the nature of a trade school taking less time to complete than a 4-year college, the amount of time a student pays tuition, in itself, is significantly lower - making the total cost of tuition lower. In addition, programs at a trade school tend to be lower in tuition price in general. Career Option Differences At a traditional 4-year college, the fields of study may veer more towards white-collar jobs such as accounting, psychology, journalism, business, etc. However, at a trade school, more blue-collar type jobs may be highlighted. This can include programs such as plumbing, welding, HVAC, electrical, and more.

More and more teens are questioning the traditional four-year college route, opting instead for alternative educational pathways that promise lucrative careers without the burden of massive student debt. This blog explores the reasons behind this trend, the benefits of skilled trades, and the evolving landscape of education in America. The College Conundrum The traditional narrative around higher education has long been that a four-year degree is essential for a successful career. However, mounting evidence suggests that this belief is losing its grip. According to a recent report from NBC Philadelphia, 49% of teens believe that a high school diploma, trade program, or two-year degree is sufficient for their future careers. This marks a significant shift in mindset, as young people increasingly recognize the limitations of the conventional college experience. The Financial Burden of College One of the most pressing issues for teens considering college is the staggering cost of tuition. With student loan debt in the U.S. surpassing $1.7 trillion, many are reconsidering whether the investment is worth it. The Public Policy Institute of California reports that while graduation rates at four-year institutions are improving, many students still do not finish their degrees in the expected timeframe. At California State University, for instance, only 36% of students graduate within four years, and about 62% complete their degrees within six years. These statistics highlight a critical flaw in the traditional education model: the uncertainty of return on investment. Many students are in debt with little guarantee of a high-paying job upon graduation. Rising Interest in Skilled Trades Amidst this financial uncertainty, skilled trades are emerging as a viable alternative to college. Professions such as electricians, plumbers, and wind tur",

Hart Main At age 13, Hart Main came up with the idea of manly scented candles after teasing his sister about the girly scented ones she was selling for a school fundraiser. It wasn't until Hart set out to purchase a $1,500 bike that he reconsidered what he suggested in jest. Hart and his parents contributed nominal amounts to begin the business and worked together to develop the candles, cleverly named ManCans. They are now handmade by the Beaver Creek Candle Company in Lisbon, Ohio, by a workforce consisting of people diagnosed with developmental challenges. Adopting a simple and masculine theme, ManCans candles\u2014with available scents including Campfire, Bacon, Sawdust, Fresh Cut Grass, and Grandpa's Pipe\u2014are made using soup cans. As of 2016, Hart's candles are sold in every state, with sales exceeding six figures annually.

This was among the findings from the latest\u00a0Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) 2021/2022 U.S. Report by Babson College.\u00a0 The report, which polled more than 2,000 U.S. adults in 2021, also shows that more Americans found and pursued new opportunities to persist despite the continued impact of the pandemic.\u00a0 Young Entrepreneurs This year\u2019s GEM report presented a pattern of high entrepreneurship rates and entrepreneurial intentions among the youngest adult age group, individuals 18-24, part of \u201cGen Z.\u201d This trend hasn\u2019t been seen in recent GEM USA report history. Among the 18-34 age group, 67% emphasized a focus on environmental sustainability and 58% were highly likely to take actions to maximize social impact and positively impact their communities. GEM Report findings also show the 18- to 24-year-olds also had high entrepreneurial intentions (20%), high entrepreneurship rates (19%) but also high business closure rates (6.2%). \u201cGenerally entrepreneurship rates peak among those who are old enough to have enough work experience, resources, and networks, but this GEM survey shows a growing interest in entrepreneurship among young people, who can bring novel ideas, their knowledge of youth market segments, and their openness to risk and learning to the entrepreneurship ranks,\u201d said GEM U.S. Team co-leader and Babson College Entrepreneurship Professor Donna J.

It highlighted a continuation of last year\u2019s surge in Total Entrepreneurial Activity (TEA) being driven by these young 18-24 years of age entrepreneurs (TEA measures the percentage of adults actively engaged in starting or running a new business). Nearly one-fourth of those in this age range surveyed (24%) are currently entrepreneurs, and 21% are intending to start a business in the next three years. From 1999 \u2013 2021, the highest TEA levels were consistently among the 25\u201334 or 35\u201344 age groups.\u00a0 The report notes the following:\u00a0\u201cThese young adults are often regarded as having creative ideas and a willingness to experiment. Additionally, they have the rest of their careers to make up any losses if their ventures do not work out, and they can apply what they learn as young entrepreneurs to their careers moving forward. However, they may not have the experience, resources and networks of those who have been in the workforce for at least several years. It may therefore be valuable to help them generate personal assets that they can leverage in their entrepreneurial pursuits and guide them in applying what they are learning along the way to maximize the success of their ventures.\u201d Other Key Findings\r The report also noted: About the Research\r This marks the 25th\u00a0GEM USA Report (GEM was founded in 1999 as a joint venture between Babson College and the London Business School).

Many employers require candidates to have a bachelor's degree or higher for entry-level positions, making it a prerequisite for advancing in certain fields.

Over a lifetime, this earnings gap can translate into substantial financial benefits.

                  "raw_content": "College Graduate Salaries vs the Cost of Living In recent years, young adults and graduates have been voicing concerns that their wages aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t keeping up with the market trends, with the cost of living eating up more and more of their earnings, leaving them with less to put towards savings. To understand if this is the case and how earnings and the cost of living have changed for young adults, this study has analyzed data from the National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) average earnings and Bureau Of Labor Statistics (BLS) expenditure data. This study aims to find out how earnings for new graduates have changed, and whether they are keeping pace with living costs. Contents Key findings Average graduate income in the U.S. The average annual graduate salary, without adjusting for inflation, has changed from $6,084 in 1960 to an estimated $61,088 in 2023. [See all sources here] But adjusting for inflation, using the BLS CPI Inflation Calculator, this actually means 1960\u2019s graduates were earning the equivalent of $62,121 in 2023 money. [10] Bureau Of Labor Statistics (BLS) CPI Inflation Calculator https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm Adjusted for inflation, 1969 saw the highest average graduate salary of $79,868 ($9,504 without inflation), while 1994\u2019s graduates had the lowest average annual graduate salary of $57,642 ($28,169 without inflation). The study also looks to review this salary data alongside the historical cost of living in the country. This data from the BLS is only available from 1984 onwards for people aged under 25 (the typical age bracket of graduates).

For years, parents, counselors, and other concerned adults told high school graduates that college was the only certain path to success. But today, college costs have soared requiring substantial private loans. Over 44 million Americans carry massive student loan debt. This reality has pushed families to view trade school with fresh eyes. In fact, a 2019 survey found that over 90% of parents would recommend a vocational career to a student. While attitudes toward trade school are changing, many families may still wonder if vocational school graduates will earn as much as those who attend a four-year college or university. This article will compare trade school and college degree salaries. The findings just might surprise you. What Is a Trade School? Trade schools (also called vocational schools) differ from traditional colleges in several ways. First, the schools offer very different educational experiences.

But anyone who wants to go down this path will have to develop certain skills that will enable them to create a thriving business. Here are the valuable skills that you will find behind every successful business owner - qualities that truly stand the test of time. 1. Ability to Communicate It\u2019s no secret that communication is an important skill for business people, but have you ever thought about why? Without the ability to communicate, i.e. pitch, educate, inspire, entrepreneurs cannot sell their products, gain support for their ideas, or raise venture capital. Communication is basically the ability to transmit ideas in an effective way, and it\u2019s a highly valuable skill for entrepreneurs, as confirmed by some of the top individuals in business. Take Warren Buffet as an example - he once said that the only diploma he hangs in his office is the communications diploma he got from Dale Carnegie in 1952. It\u2019s evidently a skill he highly values. You can have the smartest strategies in the world, but if you can\u2019t convince people to follow you or buy from you, you have no business. Any good entrepreneurship class will teach the art of persuasion and techniques to improve your people skills because they are foundational skills for business. Your ability to communicate will help you get your first few customers, but it will also help you nurture relationships and keep customers in the long run. While other parts of business can be automated or managed by computer systems, developing good communication skills can\u2019t be avoided ",

The importance of degrees and skills is reevaluated as employers seek a balance between traditional qualifications and practical abilities. It's time to address the evolving needs of the future job market, where you may need more than being a degree holder to secure your desired position in your field. In the past, degrees were seen as the ultimate ticket to success. However, we now understand that skills are equally crucial in shaping career paths. Employers are increasingly looking beyond academic achievements and seeking candidates with practical expertise and adaptability. So, how can you navigate this new reality? Whether you're a recent graduate or a seasoned professional, understanding this shift is vital for staying competitive and achieving long-term career growth. Redefining Talent: The Shift Towards Skills In today's ever-evolving job market, talent is no longer solely defined by academic achievements.

This shift towards skills as the new currency in determining employability has reshaped how organizations evaluate and hire candidates. Talent Goes Beyond Academic Achievements Gone are the days when a college degree was considered the ultimate measure of one's talent. While a degree may provide a foundation of knowledge, more is needed to guarantee practical proficiency or adaptability in a rapidly changing work environment. Employers now understand that true talent encompasses more than just what is learned within the confines of a classroom. The Rise of Skills as Currency Skill",

Historically, employers placed a heavy emphasis on formal education and job titles when selecting candidates. However, this traditional model often overlooks individuals who may have acquired the necessary skills through alternative means. Skills-based hiring is changing that, shifting the focus from credentials to capabilities and sparking a broader conversation about the value of experience vs degree and the effectiveness of merit based hiring. Traditional vs. Skills-Based Hiring Traditional hiring practices tend to prioritize degrees and certifications, using them as proxies for skill. While these credentials can be valuable, they often exclude candidates who possess relevant skills but lack formal qualifications. This brings to light the debate of degree vs experience and whether the ability to perform a role effectively is best demonstrated through academic achievements or practical skills. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, less than 40% of individuals aged 25 and older hold a bachelor\u2019s degree. This means that by requiring a degree for certain roles, companies could exclude a significant portion (62%) of the working-age population from consideration, limiting access to a large ",

With the rapid rise of technology, remote work, and a demand for specialized talents, many industries are shifting their focus away from traditional academic qualifications to real-world skills and competencies. But is it accurate to say that skills have completely overtaken a degree\u2019s value? Or do degrees still play a vital role in specific fields? The answer depends on the industry, the role, and the individual\u2019s career goals. Check out our latest podcast: Rewriting the Rules: The Future of Hiring with Former White House Appointee Lisa Gable. Listen to our latest podcast with former White House Appointee Lisa Gable The Value of Skills In a world where technology is evolving faster than academic curricula, employers increasingly prioritize skills, experience, problem-solving, and adaptability over formal education. Degrees often provide a broad education in a particular field. Still, skills are developed through hands-on experience or targeted training, making them more closely aligned with the demands of specific roles. Employers recognise that candidates with relevant skills can quickly apply their knowledge to real-world problems, making them valuable assets to the organization. A report by Intelligent.com stated 45% of companies plan to eliminate bachelor\u2019s degree requirements for some positions this year, and 55% of companies eliminated bachelor\u2019s degree requirements in 2023. Tech and IT Industries: The tech world is one of the prime examples where skills often outweigh degrees. In roles like software development, data analysis, or cybersecurity, what you can do matters far more than a degree on your resume. Many top tech companies, including Google and Apple, have made headlines for de-emphasizing degree requirements favouring practical problem-solving abilities and coding expertise.

Abstract Given the emerging concern for student wellbeing in public health discourse, a question arises: What role do campus buildings play in shaping the overall wellbeing of students? Following the PRISMA guideline, this study reviews the current building science literature that explores the relationship between higher education learning environments, specifically classroom spaces, and the wellbeing of students. Our investigation reveals that the existing literature primarily frames student wellbeing in terms of individual comfort and health. While acknowledging the importance of these aspects, we emphasize the desirability of embracing wider social and collective dimensions from an interdisciplinary perspective. We also advocate for a departure from the traditional approach that focuses primarily on mitigating adverse environmental effects to one focused on net positive environmental and human benefits. Encompassing these two perspectives, this paper presents a holistic approach to better understand the wellbe",

Understanding the interaction and influencing mechanisms between mental health and academic achievement can help individuals adjust learning and psychological states and achieve a virtuous cycle between mental health and academic achievement. A survey was conducted on 3871 freshmen using the Symptom Check-List-90 (SCL-90), Academic Self-efficacy Scale (ASES), China College Student Adjustment Scale (CCSAS), and basic quality assessment scores. The results showed that (1) Mental health is significantly correlated with learning adaptation, academic self-efficacy, and academic achievement, and mental health can significantly negatively predict academic achievement; (2) Learning adaptation partially mediates the relationship between mental health and academic self-efficacy; Academic self-efficacy plays a complete mediating role between mental health and academic achievement; (3) Learning adaptation and academic self-efficacy play a chain mediated role between mental health and academic achievement. Therefore, schools can enhance the cultivation of students\u2019 psychological qualities, cultivate their adaptability to changes in learning environments and learning methods, and systematically enhance the cultivation of students\u2019 academic self-efficacy to improve their academic achievements.

This article explores the increasing demand for mental health services, the role of staff, and various innovative programs colleges are implementing to tackle these challenges. Short Summary Rising demand for mental health services on college campuses has outpaced student enrollment growth, highlighting a mental health crisis among students. Faculty and staff play a vital role as frontline mental health support but require comprehensive training to effectively assist students. Innovative initiatives like peer counseling and wellness programs are essential for expanding mental health resources beyond traditional counseling centers. Rising Demand for Mental Health Services on College Campuses Image by freepik on Freepik The surge in the usage of counseling services on college campuses is undeniable, with rates increasing five times faster than student enrollment growth. This alarming trend reflects the growing mental health crisis among college students, characterized by heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts. The American College Health Association has reported that 76% of students experience moderate to serious psychological distress. The situation is further exacerbated by personal life stressors and global events, which significantly impact student mental health condition. In 2019, 90% of counseling center directors observed an increase in students seeking help, indicating a widespread recognition of mental health issues. Despite this rising demand, many institutions struggle to keep up, leading to common wait times for counseling appointments ranging from two to five weeks. This backlog ",

Issue date 2015 Oct. Abstract Attending college can be a stressful time for many students. In addition to coping with academic pressure, some students have to deal with the stressful tasks of separation and individuation from their family of origin while some may have to attend to numerous work and family responsibilities. In this context, many college students experience the first onset of mental health and substance use problems or an exacerbation of their symptoms. Given the uniqueness of college students, there is a need to outline critical issues to consider when working with this population. In this commentary, first, the prevalence of psychiatric and substance use problems in college students and the significance of assessing age of onset of current psychopathology are described. Then, the concerning persistent nature of mental health problems among college students and its implications are summarized. Finally, important aspects of treatment to consider when treating college students with mental health problems are outlined, such as the importance of including parents in the treatment, communicating with other providers, and employing of technology to increase adherence. It is concluded that, by becoming familiar with the unique problems characteristic of the developmental stage and environment college students are in, practitioners will be able to better serve them.

But on the flip side, all these new opportunities can cause anxiety. In fact, a 2018 study from the American College Health Association (ACHA) revealed that more than 63% of college students stated that they had felt overwhelming anxiety within the last 12 months. What\u2019s more, many colleges and universities are reporting that the number of students seeking counseling is rising. So what\u2019s driving the number of college students suffering from anxiety and seeking help? The answer is complicated, but below are the common causes: #1. Underdeveloped brains College students are particularly vulnerable to anxiety since the human brain doesn\u2019t fully develop until the mid-to-late 20s. \u201cStudent decisions aren\u2019t always the best as their frontal lobe \u2014 the lobe responsible for higher order processing such as critical thinking and decision-making \u2014 is not yet fully formed,\u201d says AJ Marsden, PhD, assistant professor of psychology at Beacon College in Leesburg, Florida. So when faced with new problems and pressures, college students tend to feel overwhelmed. #2. New environment, new challenges Moving and acclimating to a new environment, such as college, can be extremely stressful. Just imagine the number of changes going on simultaneously: they\u2019re adapting to new schedules, heavy loads",

Students entering university are from different socioeconomic background, which can bring a variety of mental health risk factors. The aim of this review was to investigate present literatures to identify risk factors associated with stress, anxiety, and depression among university undergraduate students in developed and developing countries. I identified and critically evaluated forty-one articles about risk factors associated with mental health of undergraduate university students in developed and developing countries from 2000 to 2020 according to the inclusion criteria. Selected papers were analyzed for risk factor themes. Six different themes of risk factors were identified: psychological, academic, biological, lifestyle, social and financial. Different risk factor groups can have different degree of impact on students' stress, anxiety, and depression. Each theme of risk factor was further divided into multiple subthemes.

Abstract Aim: To estimate the prevalence of symptoms of depression, anxiety, stress and associated factors in a population of college students. Method: Cross-sectional study of psychological distress measured through the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21) in a sample of 1074 college students. Results: We found a moderate prevalence of depression (18.4%), anxiety (23.6%) and stress (34.5%) symptoms in our study population. Being <21, having problematic Internet use behavior, smoking, presenting insomnia and having a low self-esteem were independently associated with symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. Being a woman, living with their family, having a stable partner, consuming alcohol frequently and having poor nutritional habits were significantly associated with symptoms of stress; lacking a stable partner was significantly associated with depressive symptoms; and frequent consumption of alcohol was significantly associated with symptoms of anxiety. Conclusion: We found a moderate prevalence of depression, anxiety and stress ",

The rapid rise of online education due to the COVID-19 pandemic has left many wondering: how does this learning environment shift impact students\u2019 mental health? While online learning offers flexibility and convenience, research suggests it can also have negative consequences, particularly for children and teens. In this article, we\u2019ll explore strategies for mitigating the potential drawbacks of remote learning for mental well-being. How does online learning affect mental health? Because online learning is a relatively new phenomenon, we still need more research studies to determine, with certainty, how it affects mental health. From the studies conducted so far, we know it can have harmful effects, especially for children and teens. Here are some of the ways remote learning can negatively impact mental health. Social isolation One of the primary effects of the switch to remote learning was increased social isolation. In various studies, students across multiple countries, including the United States, China, Denmark, Peru, and more, reported less interaction with peers and greater feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was likely caused by social distancing measures in general, but most young people experienced social distancing primarily through school closures (remote learning)[2]. We may be able to get the same educational information online as in person, but school serves a purpose much greater than academic knowledge. School is like a workplace; it\u2019s a place where we go to connect with other people. It\u2019s especially important for children to have a community of peers while they\u2019re developing. Often, school is the only place where children have access to this community. Remote learning simply doesn\u2019t offer t",

The focus included six aspects: academic performance, physical activity, social isolation, food insecurity and other stressors, pros and cons, and religion and mental health. Each aspect included advantages and disadvantages that adolescent students experienced. The study included 6th - 12th graders attending a Charter school. The eligibility requirement was that participants participated in online learning during the 2020-2021 school year. Academic performance data was obtained from the school office for students who attended the school during online learning and requested from parents if they attended other schools. Both positive and negative effects of factors were obtained using online questionnaires, which were reviewed during in-person interviews to investigate what challenges students experienced and how online learning effected mental health. Parents of student participants and current teachers were recruited and administered a short questionnaire to obtain their perspectives and observations of the six aspects.

Abstract The mental health of students learning online is a critical task for many countries around the globe. The research purpose was to analyse the factors affecting the quality of mental health of young individuals who learnt under conditions of not total lockdowns but adaptive quarantine restrictions. The research involved 186 volunteers from Zhengzhou University of Technology, 94 were first-year students, and 92 were fourth-year students. The experimental group involved first-year students, and the control group involved fourth-year students. An average age of the participants in the experimental group was 18.3 years, and in the control group, the average age was 22.4 years. The scholars conducted the research after four months of distance learning under the adaptive quarantine. The students could be involved in their usual entertainment activities and interpersonal communication outside the home. The Behavioural Health Measure, better known as BHM-20, was the core psychometric tool. The research finds that distance learning is less effective for first-year students than for fourth-year students because the former cannot effectively adapt and ",

Abstract This article aims to analyze the trend of publications on student stress and mental health topics during online learning as well as the potential for post-COVID-19 curriculum development. 1456 articles were analyzed by the bibliometric method. Data were obtained from the Scopus database consisting of 1382 articles, 73 review articles, 1 conference article. Based on the analysis, Li X is the most productive author with 16 documents, while in terms of the number of citations, Wang C ranks first with 3897 citations. Meanwhile the most frequently used keywords were COVID-19 (n\u00a0=\u00a0862), followed by stress (n\u00a0=\u00a0312), mental health (n\u00a0=\u00a0260), anxiety (n\u00a0=\u00a0248), and depression (n\u00a0=\u00a0214). These represent the trend of publications related to the topics discussed in 2020. Moreover, alternative research themes such as online learning, higher education, sleep, loneliness, perceived stress, insomnia, emotional intelligence, and psychological resilience can be further investigated in the future. This article recommends developing a curriculum that can accommodate various issues during COVID-19 and the changing learning climate after the pandemic.

Alternative means of support, such as online interventions, have been identified as cost-effective and efficient ways to provide inclusive support to HE students, removing many of the barriers to help-seeking as well as promoting mental health and wellbeing. Case presentation The current case study initially outlines the rigorous approach in the development of one such online intervention system, MePlusMe. It further highlights key features that constitute innovative delivery of evidence-based psychological and educational practice in the areas of mental health, promotion of wellbeing, support of mood and everyday functioning, and study-skills enhancement. Conclusions This case study aims to present the innovative features of MePlusMe in relation to current needs and evidence-basis. Finally, it presents future directions in the evaluation, assessment, and evidence of the fitness-for-purpose process. Background Entering Higher Education (HE) is an exciting, yet challenging time. Students have a host of changes to manage, including making new relationships, living apart from friends and family, acquiring new study skills, and learning to function as independent adults [1]. Several studies have indeed shown rising levels of anxiety and depression amongst HE students, compared to pre-university levels [2,3,4]. Apart from severe mental health issues, mild to moderate psychological difficulties, which occur more frequently, can have a big negative impact on the life of students and often go undetected and unsupported [5].

Substance use refers to the use of selected substances, including alcohol, tobacco products, drugs, inhalants, and other substances that can be consumed, inhaled, injected, or otherwise absorbed into the body with possible dependence and other detrimental effects. Suicide management resources and guidance can assist schools and school districts in designing and implementing strategies to prevent suicide and promote behavioral health. School staff trainings, development of partnerships with mental health professionals in a school\u2019s community, and capacity building for mental health support in schools play a vital role in promoting students\u2019 mental health and well-being.

Here are nine strategies to do just that. \u2018An Acute Concern\u2019 Ron Berger has nearly 50 years of experience in education, 28 of them as a public school teacher. He is the author of a collection of books on education and has been instrumental in developing EL Education\u2019s foundational practices, deeply embedding his belief in the transformative power of high-quality student work into the organization\u2019s vision for teaching and learning: I parked my truck in a school parking lot recently and had to walk around a large ambulance to get up the steps to the front door. I greeted the principal and asked if everything was OK. \u201cAnother mental health crisis,\u201d she said sadly. \u201cOur third this year. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on.\u201d In my 48 years working in public education, I have never seen conditions as challenging for students\u2019 mental health as these. This issue is an acute concern for all the schools and districts I am privileged to collaborate with. There are alarming data that support my concerns. Last year, the American Psychological Association described the situation in this way in their Trends Report: \u201cIn the 10 years leading up to the pandemic, feelings of persistent sadness and hopelessness\u2014as well as suicidal thoughts and behaviors\u2014increased by about 40% among young people, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s (CDC) Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System. \u2018We\u2019re seeing really high rates of suicide and depression, and this has been going on for a while,\u201d said psychologist Kimberly Hoagwood, PhD, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at Ne",

This study investigates the various dimensions of academic pressure and its implications for student well-being, emphasizing the effects on mental health in the classroom and advocating for a supportive learning environment that encourages academic risk-taking. The methodology consists of a literature review of various peer-reviewed sources, Test anxiety theoretical frameworks, and a community partner interview with an experienced educator. The positionality explains how personal and professional experiences aligning with the theoretical frameworks influenced this study. Throughout this study, readers will learn about the psychological outcomes associated with excessive academic pressure, such as anxiety, depression, burnout, and suicidal ideation. Readers also learn about the hindrances in the study including institutional practices, and societal and parental expectations. Incorporating Social Emotional Learning (SEL) into education strengthens academic performance while understanding the many sources of academic pressure will help educators to support students effectively. Findings include educators prioritizing mental health discussions, advocating for students, fostering strong relationships, creating safe environments, and continually educating themselves to better support students. As a future teacher, prioritizing creating a supportive classroom environment that values imperfection is vital.

This involves regularly planning their future and doing what it takes to get there academically. While this can be productive and encourage kids to aim high, the cycle of always looking ahead in one\u2019s academic life can be harmful. Many young adults go through a tremendous amount of academic pressure to get good grades, get into a prestigious college, and prepare for a successful career. Here, we\u2019ll examine academic pressure, its causes and effects, and some of the most effective coping strategies. What is Academic Pressure? Academic pressure is \u201cthe tension, discomfort, and other emotions caused by the pressure from school, family, and society in the learning process [*].\u201d From an early age, children are highly encouraged or sometimes even required by parents, guardians, or educators to think ahead and achieve academic milestones. This pattern of constantly anticipating the next step can be stressful for students, thus resulting in tension, discomfort, and other negative emotions. While it is common for young students to be motivated by mild academic pressure, many also have negative experiences with such pressure, especially if it is in excess. Part of a young person\u2019s development through adolescence is learning how to balance the demands of life, and academic pressure can end up hindering one\u2019s growth. Causes of Academic Pressure on Students There are several causes of academic pressure on students, including the following: Signs That a Student is Experiencing Excessive Academic Pressure Academic pressure is not necessarily a bad thing.

Abstract Background Lowered mental wellbeing of students is a growing health and societal problem. Experiencing high levels of stress for a longer period of time has been associated with an increased risk for lower mental wellbeing and mental health problems. To reduce stress and improve mental wellbeing it is important to understand how various sources of stress are related with mental wellbeing and which factors can buffer the impact of stress on mental wellbeing. Objectives Deriving from a conceptual model the aim of the study was to explore 1) the association of underlying stressors (academic pressure, family circumstances, side-activity pressure, and financial situation) with perceived stress and mental wellbeing, 2) whether perceived stress mediates the association between the sources of stress and mental wellbeing and 3) whether loneliness, self-esteem, personality and coping styles buffer or reinforce the impact of perceived stress on mental wellbeing.

She discusses how mentally preparing helped, as well as pushing herself out of her comfort zone. She also shares how she was able to receive support at university for her mental health. Francesca found moving to university a daunting experience, she discusses the things that helped her to adjust and finding support for her mental health. Hi. My name is Francesca and I'm in my third year of my law degree at Leeds Trinity University. Going to university, I was scared. I was scared I wouldn't make any friends. I was scared I couldn't handle being away from home. I was scared my mental health wouldn't be supported. Most of all, I was scared that I wasn't going to enjoy my time at university. As my second year came to a close, I can safely say I had the best year of my life whilst being at uni. I realised that my anxieties were just that. Anxiety. And the actuality of the experience was fun and new and granted, at times, a bit scary. But mostly I experienced happiness. Moving away from home to go to university is an increasingly common occurrence. However, this doesn't make the experience any less scary. Prior to my acceptance at uni, I had never lived away from home. I'd never lived in a town that wasn't my home town and I'd never lived in a big multicultural city like Leeds. Frankly, I was terrified to move away from home and from my comforts but I took that leap of faith and wanted to conquer my fears. Moving away from home is scary for everyone, even those who claim it's not because we are creatures of habit and comfort and being thrust into a brand new environment is inevitably going to be a nerve wracking experience. One of the biggest pieces of advice I can give for moving to a new city is to be prepared. And I don't mean getting all your IKEA kitchen equipment bought, I mean be ready to make new friends",

It\u2019s easy to get overwhelmed by all the new responsibilities, even if you\u2019ve been fairly independent before. But remember, university life is a time where you can get used to living on your own in a safer, more supported way.\u00a0 Managing your space The fantastic thing about living away from home is that you get to decide what you want your space to look like. It\u2019s a great time to figure out what a good home looks like for you. What makes you happy to see? What do you want close to hand? Do you want everything spick and span, or do you want to drop everything on a chair and move on?\u00a0 Whatever you want your home to be, it\u2019s amazing what a difference it makes to feel like it\u2019s a clean, comfortable space where you\u2019re in control.\u00a0 Keeping on top of housework Especially when stresses are piling up, it\u2019s easy to let things like washing up, laundry and cleaning fall by the wayside. Of course, if you\u2019re renting, your landlord will hold you accountable \u2013 but it\u2019s also important for your own wellbeing.

As advocates for their emotional, mental, and social health, counselors play a pivotal role in shaping not just successful students but fulfilled individuals. Let\u2019s explore the significance of prioritizing student well-being and delve into tangible examples that illustrate how counselors champion this cause. 1. Addressing Academic Stress: Counselors recognize the academic pressures students face, especially during the college preparation phase. By fostering an open dialogue, they create a supportive space where students can discuss their concerns and develop strategies to manage stress. Encouraging healthy study habits, time management skills, and effective coping mechanisms becomes a cornerstone of their advocacy. 2. Nurturing Emotional Resilience: Transitioning to college can be emotionally challenging. Counselors guide students in building emotional resilience, helping them navigate the ups and downs of this significant life change. Through one-on-one sessions or group workshops, counselors provide tools for self-reflection, emotional regulation, and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. 3. Promoting Mental Health Awareness: Counselors advocate for mental health awareness by destigmatizing seeking support. They actively engage in conversations about mental health, ensuring students understand the resources available to them. Whether it\u2019s organizing mental health awareness campaigns, workshops, or integrating mindfulness practices, counselors foster a culture where well-being is a shared priority. 4. Facilitating Social Connections: College is not just an academic journey but a social one. Counselors recognize the importance of social connections in overall well-being. They guide students in finding communities, clubs, or organizations that align with their interests, ",

Abstract Aims The review of reviews had three aims: (i) to synthesize the available evidence on interventions to improve college and university students\u2019 mental health and wellbeing; (ii) to identify the effectiveness of interventions, and (iii) to highlight gaps in the evidence base for future study. Methods Electronic database searches were conducted to identify reviews in English from high-income OECD countries published between 1999 and 2020. All review-level empirical studies involving post-secondary students attending colleges of further education or universities that examined interventions to improve general mental health and wellbeing were included. Articles were critically appraised using an amended version of the AMSTAR 2 tool. Evidence from the included reviews were narratively synthesized and organised by intervention types. Results Twenty-seven reviews met the review of reviews inclusion criteria. The quality of the included reviews varied considerably. Intervention types identified included: mind",

Objectives: To assess the 12-month prevalence of psychiatric disorders, sociodemographic correlates, and rates of treatment among individuals attending college and their non-college-attending peers in the United States. Design, setting, and participants: Face-to-face interviews were conducted in the 2001-2002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (N = 43,093). Analyses were done for the subsample of college-aged individuals, defined as those aged 19 to 25 years who were both attending (n = 2188) and not attending (n = 2904) college in the previous year. Main outcome measures: Sociodemographic correlates and prevalence of 12-month DSM-IV psychiatric disorders, substance use, and treatment seeking among college-attending individuals and their non-college-attending peers. Results: Almost half of college-aged individuals had a psychiatric disord",

To compare mental health status of college students and their non-college-attending peers whether working, attending a secondary school, or non-college-attending peers who are neither employed nor students or trainees (NENST) will allow to focus on high risk group. Methods Data were drawn from a large cross-sectional survey conducted by phone in 2005 in four French regions in a randomly selected sample of 22,138 adults. Analyses were restricted to the college-age subsample, defined as those aged 18 to 24 (n\u2009=\u20092424). Sociodemographic, educational, and occupational status were determined. In addition, respondents were administered standardized instruments to assess mental health and well-being (CIDI-SF, SF-36, Sheehan Disability Scale, CAGE), mastery, social support, and isolation. The four occupational groups were compared. All analyses were stratified by gender. Results Mental health disorders were more prevalent among the NENST group, with significant differences among men for anxiety disorders including phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panic disorder, impairing at least one role in their daily life. This was also true among women except for panic disorder. The NENST group also reported the lowest level of mastery and social support for both genders and the highest level of social isolation for women only. After adjustment, occupational status remained an independent correlate of PTSD (OR\u2009=\u20092.92 95 % CI\u2009=\u20091.4\u20136.1), agoraphobia (OR\u2009=\u20091.86 95 % CI 1.07\u20133.22) and alcohol dependence (OR\u2009=\u20092.1 95 % CI\u2009=\u20091.03\u20134.16).

With refreshed data about test-optional admissions, we address the import of institutional responsiveness to redress persistent equity gaps that impact our state\u2019s workforce diversity and hiring challenges. Leveraging data to inform advocacy is representative of the skillset cultivated in the CANDEL program for evidence-based decision-making. Moreover, the pre-pandemic position over standardized testing exemplifies how CANDEL encouraged us to explore novel approaches to address persistent and troublesome equity issues. With leadership roles in the community college and the University of California systems and a particular emphasis on workforce development, we reflect on the CANDEL ethos of scholar-practitioner leadership in our practice areas to promote equitable educational and career outcomes.

Harun Ar Rashid | Aug 29, 2023 | Teaching & Learning The Effects of Standardized Testing on Student Learning: In the realm of education, standardized testing has emerged as a key tool for assessing student learning outcomes and educational system effectiveness. These assessments are designed to measure students\u2019 knowledge, skills, and abilities in a uniform manner, with the aim of providing valuable insights into their academic progress. However, the impact of standardized testing on student learning is a subject of ongoing debate. This article explores the effects of standardized testing on student learning. 1. Accountability and School Improvement: Standardized testing plays a pivotal role in maintaining accountability at various levels of the education system. Darling-Hammond and Adamson (2017) note that these tests offer an objective and standardized measure of student proficiency. This objectivity allows policymakers, educators, and parents to gauge the performance of schools, districts, and educational systems as a whole. When tied to performance metrics, such as Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) in the United States, standardized testing provides a transparent mechanism for evaluating the effectiveness of schools in meeting predetermined academic benchmarks. Moreover, the accountability fostered by standardized testing encourages schools to engage in continuous improvement. Schools that consistently achieve positive results are celebrated for their success, motivating other institutions to replicate effective strategies. Conversely, schools that fall short of expectations are prompted to identify areas for enhancement and implement targeted interventions. This accountability mechanism thus drives a culture of striving for excellence and promotes the overall betterment of the education system. 2. Data-Driven Instruction: One of the most significant advantages of standardized testing lies in its ability to facilitate data-driven i",

Well before the current outbreak of COVID-19, skeptics questioned the value of standardized testing as a college admissions requirement. Some argue this pandemic, however, will be the final nail in the testing coffin. As this outlet has pointed out, the majority of colleges are now test optional or test blind, and headlines proclaim \u201cthe beginning of the end\u201d for standardized tests or (put more simply) \u201cKill the SAT.\u201d There is another side to this story, however, that should not be left out: standardized tests can\u200a -- when used constructively and administered safely\u200a -- drive higher standards in education and more rigorous, targeted instruction for students in essential college readiness skills. Too often, standardized tests are created as a single moment in students' lives: they take the test, they receive a score and they move on. Instead, we have found that college entrance exams can be used as powerful learning opportunities to help students master academic skills. These skills help students succeed both on and beyond the tests\u200a -- in high school, in college and in their careers. The conversation about college readiness and quality of instruction should include a careful and intentional review of student performance on standardized tests. Indeed, we believe that standardized tests can be a valuable tool for educators to better prepare students for college-level work. With continued remote learning anticipated well into the 2020-21 school year, we predict a continued amplification effect to extended summer learning loss. The increased time out of the physical classroom has led to research predicting increased losses in foundational skills for students returning this fall, a phenomenon now commonly called the \u201cCOVID slide.\u201d Current research predicts students may retain only 50\u00a0percent of the gains they made in math during the 2019-20 school year, which was abruptly cut short as the nation",

One of the most the most pressure-packed tests a young adult can take, the SAT brings back memories of stress and anxiety for many students. The American Psychological Association\u2019s annual Stress in America survey reported 31 percent of teens feeling overwhelmed and another 30 percent feeling sad or depressed as a result of stress, pointing to school and school-related activities as a key cause. With stress levels rivaling those of adults, students could really benefit from eliminating some stress-inducers from their daily lives. Considering the SAT is a proven to be reflection of socioeconomic status (SES) and a poor indicator of success in college, it is time that the test gets\u00a0removed from the college admissions process once and for all. The belief that the standardized test is the \u201cgreat leveler\u201d that sets all students on an equal playing field for evaluation is a huge misconception. It has been empirically proven year after year that performance on SAT and ACT tests is\u00a0positively correlated to a student\u2019s SES by College Board data and National Center for Fair and Open Testing research. Thus, those who are already advantaged in education are given another leg up in college admissions. The reasons for the correlation are not difficult to uncover. Money buys expensive SAT practice test books, test prep classes, private college counselors, etc. While there are a myriad of factors that create SES-related inequality in education, the SAT test in particular is a measure of whether a student can afford to \u201clearn the tricks\u201d of the tests. Even signing up for the test costs about $50. While students can receive aid from the government, the fee waive",

These tests were designed to provide a fair and consistent way to evaluate students, but as education evolves, people are starting to ask: Are standardized tests still relevant today?

The paper, to be published in the Journal of Educational Psychology, suggests that hundreds of thousands of college students have been affected by differential and varied predictions of their success based on how they perform on standardized tests such as the SAT and GRE. \u201cOur main implication is that tests do not work in the same way across colleges and universities, and we have found that hundreds of thousands of people's predicted GPA based on SAT scores were under- or overestimated,\u201d said lead author Herman Aguinis, the John F. Mee Chair of Management and a professor of organizational behavior and human resources at Kelley. \u201cIf the prediction is not the same, that means that you can benefit or suffer based only on your ethnicity or gender, because your performance is expected to be higher or lower than it will be, which means you\u2019re more or less likely to be offered a scholarship or you\u2019re more or less likely to be offered admission.\u201d His co-authors on the paper, \u201cDifferential Prediction Generalization in College Admissions Testing,\u201d are Steven A. Culpepper of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Charles A. Pierce of the University of Memphis. Their results are timely, given that an increasing number of colleges and universities are making the SAT an optional part of the admissions process. In 2010, the same co-authors first examined the issue in a groundbreaking paper in the Journal of Applied Psychology, which concluded that the methods used by the College Board and other entities for admissions or employm",

Now two years later, while COVID-19 continues to complicate how schools approach education, students, teachers, and parents are questioning the necessity of standardized tests. As the pandemic exacerbates many inequities in education, more educators and parents seem to finally be turning their attention to an issue that BIPOC students have long suspected: the only standard thing in standardized testing is bias. For most students, standardized testing requirements often carry intense pressure and expectations because of their value to U.S. college admissions. Tests like the SAT, ACT, and GRE are designed to measure a student\u2019s aptitude in critical areas like math and English and can influence the decisions institutions make regarding applications and admittance. Although each test has the same questions and timing limit for \u201cstandardized\u201d results, education experts and advocates have been increasingly critical about how the tests can be biased against students of color. The presence of COVID-19 has only heightened the stakes for BIPOC students, whose communities continue to disproportionately suffer the effects of the pandemic and the further ero",

Is that a mistake? By Natalie Proulx Many colleges have stopped requiring standardized tests like the SAT and ACT for admissions. Are you planning on going to college? If so, are you planning to take the SAT and ACT? Or do the schools you want to attend no longer require them? What is your opinion on standardized tests when it comes to college admissions? Do you believe they are a useful measure of a student\u2019s academic capabilities? Do you think they make college admissions more or less equitable and fair? Why? In \u201cThe Misguided War on the SAT,\u201d David Leonhardt writes that, while colleges have fled standardized tests on the theory that they hurt diversity, that\u2019s not what the research shows: After the Covid pandemic made it difficult for high school students to take the SAT and ACT, dozens of selective colleges dropped their requirement that applicants do so. Colleges described the move as temporary, but nearly all have since stuck to a test-optional policy. It reflects a backlash against standardized tests that began long before the pandemic, and many people have hailed the change as a victory for equity in higher education. Now, though, a growing number of experts and university administrators wonder whether the switch has been a mistake. Research has increasingly shown that standardized test scores contain real information, helping to predict college grades, chances of graduation and post-college success. Test scores are more reliable than high school grades, partly because of grade inflation in recent years. Without test scores, admissions officers sometimes have a hard time distinguishing between applicants who are likely to do well at elite colleges and those who are likely to struggle. Researchers who have studied the issue say that test scores can be particularly helpful in identifying lower-income students and underrepresented minorities who will thri",

Hughey Western Kentucky University For several years, educational researchers have noted a direct correlation between socioeconomic status and scores on standardized tests such as the ACT, SAT, and GRE. It is well documented that students from more affluent families typically score significantly higher on these tests than do their counterparts from families who are less affluent. And the relationship is linear; the higher the socioeconomic status of the family, the higher the test scores. Now there is solid scientific evidence that the brain is physically affected by being raised in poverty. In a study that was published earlier this year in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found chronic stress experienced from growing up in poverty appears to have a direct impact on the development of the br",

Yet the immutable factors of socioeconomic status (SES) and race have, consistently, been implicated in fostering an achievement gap. The current study explores, at the school-level, the impact of these factors on test scores. Percentage of students proficient for Language and Math was analyzed from 452 schools across the state of New Jersey. By high school, 52% of the variance in Language and 59% in Math test scores can be accounted for by SES and racial factors. At this level, a 1% increase in school minority population corresponds to a 0.19 decrease in percent Language proficient and 0.33 decrease for Math. These results have significant implications as they suggest that school-level interventions to improve academic achievement scores will be stymied by socioeconomic and racial factors and efforts to improve the achievement gap via testing have largely measured it.

Educational accountability falls short of addressing the diverse requirements of students with disabilities, which poses a significant challenge in achieving educational equity for all. Through a comprehensive review of relevant literature, this study highlights the inherent challenges faced by students with disabilities in meeting the AYP targets, as these assessments often fail to accommodate their diverse abilities and learning styles. By analyzing the unintended consequences of NCLB, this research emphasizes the urgent need for alternative assessment strategies that promote inclusivity and foster educational growth for students with disabilities. The study explores various alternative assessment methods, including performance-based assessments and portfolio assessments. It examines the potential benefits and challenges associated with modified assessments, emphasizing the importance of incorporating multiple measures of student performance to provide a comprehensive evaluation of their academic achievements. Furthermore, this research addresses the need for policy reforms that recognize the needs of students with disabilities to ensure equitable evaluation of practices. It calls for a shift in educational policies towards alternative assessments that provide meaningful and valid measures of academic progress for students with disabilities.

However, upon closer examination, it becomes evident that this widely accepted practice is far from equitable. In fact, it perpetuates inequality and hinders marginalized individuals from accessing quality education. One of the biggest myths surrounding standardized testing is that it provides an equal opportunity for all students. The reality is that students from disadvantaged backgrounds often face numerous barriers that impede their performance on these tests. Factors such as limited access to resources, inadequate preparation, and the absence of a supportive learning environment put them at a significant disadvantage. Consequently, their scores do not accurately reflect their true potential, further marginalizing them and hindering their chances of pursuing higher education. Moreover, standardized testing exacerbates existing inequalities by favoring students from privileged backgrounds. Affluent families can afford expensive test preparation courses, private tutors, and additional resources that give their children an unfair advantage. This creates a vicious cycle where the rich get richer, while marginalized students are left behind, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and limited opportunities. Furthermore, standardized testing fails to account for the diverse learning styles and abilities of students. It places undue emphasis on rote memorization and regurgitation of information, neglecting critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving skills. This narrow focus not only limits the potential of students but also undermines the inclusive and holistic nature of education. To achieve fairness, equity, and inclusion in education, it is crucial to deconstruct the myths surrounding standardized testing. Instead of relying solely on test scores, educational institutions should adopt a more comprehensive and multifaceted approac",

The rise of the test-optional movement over the past several years has served as a natural experiment putting these questions to the test. The New York Times recently published a piece titled The Misguided War on the SAT that supports the claim that the tests are useful for predicting important outcomes such as college GPA and graduation rates and do not, as feared, diminish student diversity. An academic study released last summer by the group Opportunity Insights, covering the so-called Ivy Plus colleges (the eight in the Ivy League, along with Duke, M.I.T., Stanford and the University of Chicago), showed little relationship between high school grade point average and success in college. The researchers found a strong relationship between test scores and later success. \u00a0 Likewise, a faculty committee at the University of California system \u2014 led by Dr. Henry S\u00e1nchez, a pathologist, and Eddie Comeaux, a professor of education \u2014 concluded in 2020 that test scores were better than high school grades at predicting student success in the system\u2019s nine colleges, where more than 230,000 undergraduates are enrolled.

UChicago Consortium researchers found that the predictive power of GPAs is consistent across high schools\u2014something that did not hold true for test scores. At many high schools, they discovered no connection between students\u2019 ACT scores and eventual college graduation. The authors were also surprised to find that, at some high schools, students with the highest ACT scores were less likely to succeed in college. These findings suggest that college admissions may be overemphasizing test scores, or that high school students with high test scores may be less prepared for demanding college programs than they believe. \u201cThe bottom line is that high school grades are powerful tools for gauging students\u2019 readiness for college, regardless of which high school a student attends, while ACT scores are not,\u201d said co-author Elaine M.

Updated: May 25, 2024 When I was applying for college (over 20 years ago), SAT or ACT scores were required by every major school and were widely thought to be a significant determining factor in admissions. This is no longer the case. Over the years, colleges and universities have undergone shifts in their views on standardized admissions tests. While standardized tests such as the SAT and ACT have been widely used as a component of the college admissions process, there has been a growing acknowledgment of their limitations and a movement toward more holistic admissions practices. In my opinion, this is a good thing. Here are several ways in which colleges have changed their views on standardized admissions tests: Test-Optional Policies: One significant trend is the adoption of test-optional or test-flexible policies by an increasing number of colleges. Test-optional policies allow applicants to decide whether or not to submit standardized test scores as part of their application. This change reflects a recognition that standardized tests may not be t",

Although admissions tests measure skills needed in college work and are useful in predicting college performance, the substantial test-score differences among ethnic and socioeconomic groups are a cause for concern.\u00a0 Asian and White test takers score higher, on average, than Black, Hispanic, and Native American test takers, and test takers from higher-income families perform better than lower-income test takers.\u00a0 While group differences do not in themselves demonstrate that a test is biased or unfair, a heavy emphasis on test scores in admissions decisions will result in lower selection rates for candidates who are Black, Hispanic, or Native American or are from low-income families. These concerns have led to an increased emphasis on high school grades and personal characteristics in the admissions process.\u00a0 Grades are predictive of college success and reflect four years of academic accomplishments.\u00a0 However, grading stringency varies over high schools, courses, and teachers and over time.\u00a0 Grades can also be influenced by extraneous factors such as a student\u2019s socioeconomic status, gender, or ethnicity.\u00a0 In the absence of tests, grades could be vulnerable to lobbying efforts by parents and other inflationary pressures.\u00a0 Also, the patterns of group differences in grades are typically similar to, though less pronounced than, the patterns observed for test scores.

These tests offered a way for colleges to recognize and admit talented students who they might otherwise overlook because they do not come from traditional \u201cfeeder\u201d high schools. But the use of these tests has been extensively criticized for favoring children from wealthier families because these applicants have greater opportunity for test preparation, can afford to take the test multiple times, and, possibly, the test questions are biased in their favor. During COVID, many colleges made applicants\u2019 submission of standardized test scores optional, or even adopted test-blind admissions. But now many top-tier private colleges have shifted back to requiring students to provide test scores. This memo looks at some recent research on whether standardized testing is a useful and fair tool in admissions decisions and discusses what this means for efforts to ensure that higher education contributes to a just and productive society. Standardized testing can be a valuable tool in helping selective colleges identify talented students from disadvantaged backgrounds.

Ever since the Progressive and Civil Rights Era, students from low-income backgrounds have been discriminated against with the use of these tests. My findings demonstrate that standardized tests have consistently disadvantaged low-income students Additionally, students of low-income backgrounds cannot afford the resources, such as test booklets, practice tests, and tutors, that help students to do well on these tests. As future generation teachers, we need to help students keep a growth mindset in which they feel positively about themselves and their test-taking skills. We also should try to assess students in alternative ways such as using project-based assessments and accessing students based on the basic skills that will allow them to be successful adults. Keywords: Standardized Testing, Low-income, and discriminate 3 The Disadvantages of Standardized Testing Standardized testing has been a huge problem in US public schoolsThese tests are geared toward advantagingstudents of affluent backgrounds, eaving the students of low-income backgrounds to struggle. For many decades now this has been an issue. Students have been discriminated against by using these tests for many years and different Eras now including the Progressive Era and Civil Rights Era. For example, in the Progressive Era, they used these tests to penalize students who were not white and during the Civil Rights Era, these tests were used to discriminate against Title 1 schools (Cunningham, 2019). These tests are biased and mean a great deal to students' futures, therefore it's unfair we rely so heavily on these tests. Students of low",

Multimedia Editor S21 & F21 (Jade McIntyre / Daily Titan) The SAT and ACT standardized testing is unfair for low-income and first-generation students whose families can\u2019t provide aid for higher education due to unawareness or financial insecurity. For example, Krystal Raynes is a Filipina first-generation college student whose plans for higher education were threatened because she didn\u2019t have the resources to prepare for the two mandatory college entrance exams, the SAT and ACT. \u201cI got a pretty average SAT score,\u201d Raynes said. \u201cIt was so disheartening, because I was like, \u2018I studied, and I\u2019m almost a straight A student.\u2019 It felt like all of my hard work I did in high school, all extracurriculars were meaningless because it all depended on this SAT score.\u201d\u00a0 Today, Raynes is serving as the 2020-22 student trustee for the California State University system. She is currently studying at CSU Bakersfield, majoring in computer science and business. After graduation, Raynes wants to attend Sacramento State to pursue a masters in public policy.\u00a0 Standardized testing should slowly transition away from the college application process because a low test score for disadvantaged students becomes a barrier that limits access to higher education.\u00a0 Raynes said that although she didn\u2019t live in a low-income household, she still felt disadvantaged as a first-generation student. Raynes lacked the aid and resources that wealthy students usually had access to, such as private tutors and learning programs for standardized testing.\u00a0 Roughly 2 million students in the United States take the SAT every year. The bar is set high as high school seniors strive to be a shining star, hoping to stand out among millions of applicants applying for",

Anushka Shah Oct 30, 2024 How Standardized Testing Policies Reflect Wider Changes in College Admissions \u201cI\u2019m Sorry, I Can\u2019t Always Know the Answer.\u201d The debate over the value of standardized testing, specifically in regards to college admissions, is nothing new. For decades, critics, educators, families, and students alike have argued that standardized testing does not provide an accurate assessment of individual abilities. Instead, scores are often determined by available resources and external factors that disadvantage students from marginalized groups. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic gave these critics a cause for celebration, with FairTest reporting that over 1600 colleges\u00a0went test-optional for the 2020-2021 application season. For the first time, students could choose whether or not to submit standardized test scores. Since then, the majority of schools have yet to revert back to pre-COVID standards. In 2021, the prestigious University of California System unanimously chose to no longer consider any standardized testing scores\u00a0when making admissions or scholarship decisions. The system\u2019s board reasoned that this permanent test-blind admission process is intended to combat assertions that the SAT/ACT is an unfair and outdated measure of student prowess. As a result of this decision, UCLA Professor and Association for the Study of Higher Education former president Sylvia Hurtado explained\u00a0that, \u201call racial and ethnic groups benefited with increases in admissions\u201d due to the shift to more holistic review processes. Nevertheless, it has maintained its exceptional reputation, while UC Berkeley and UCLA remain tied for the #1 spot in the yearly U.S. News & World Report.

Even among college graduates searching for work, employers have found them lacking employable skills. Research that examines how college graduates transition into the workforce has intensified since the 1990s when researchers connected graduates\u2019 career success with the quality of their education. Thus, improving graduates\u2019 employability became a subject that was gaining attention. The needs in the labor market have been changing due to technological advances and economic globalization, which created uncertainties about which skills college graduates needed for the workforce. There became a need to revisit what four-year colleges and universities are teaching students and what students are learning to be adequately prepared to enter the workforce. In 2016, I conducted a research study, An Examination of Perceived Employability Skills between Employers and College Graduates, that compared how employers perceived the employability skills of college graduates and how college graduates perceived their own skills. I found that there is a significant gap between what employers expect of their new hires and what college graduates can offer. Using the Department of Education\u2019s framework, employability skills are general skills used in the labor market by workers across experience levels and job types. The framework comprises nine key skills which fall into three broad categories and includes 39 identifying skills: \u00a0 I created two surveys to identify and measure the discrepancies between these skills that employers desired and the self-perceptions of college graduates about their acquired skills. The surveys were sent during May and June 2016 to two groups: employers and graduating college seniors.

The knowledge revolution accelerated this trend: professionals are now not only the people who \u201chave\u201d the knowledge, but they should be also able to find it quickly and efficiently, and have the skills to apply knowledge in new situations, extending the scope of their initial field of expertise. With massive growth of free open educational resources, knowledge became available and accessible to everyone with a simple Internet connection. All these conditions currently call into question the role and operationalization of educational processes in Higher Education, since universities are no longer the one central source of knowledge generation.

A Harvard Business Review article highlights how behind-the-times colleges and universities are in adapting to the modern life. \u201cOne measure of this is that less than 5% of college budgets are dedicated to IT spending. According to U.S. Department of Education data, while one-third of all U.S. college students had some type of online course experience before the pandemic, the other two-thirds remained traditional campus-based lectures \u2014 little-changed from hundreds of years ago.\u201d As colleges and universities struggled to enact plans to manage the effects of a global health pandemic, many students were left caught in middle and frustrated with their options. And rightfully so. It shouldn\u2019t take a global health pandemic to drive necessary competition and industry-wide improvements, but it seems that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.

Getty Images For as long as many of us can remember, the four-degree was a symbol of prestige\u2014accomplishment, pride and self-esteem. High-school graduates were encouraged to pursue a degree in order to be financially and psychologically secure. But since the pandemic, the tide has been changing. More business leaders are saying a four-year degree is no longer necessary for jobs that can earn top dollar. This goes against a long-held tradition that everybody needs a four-year degree to be socially accepted and financially successful. That message has been drilled into students' heads from parents and schools, according to James Neave, head of data science at Adzuna\u2014the world\u2019s most comprehen",

The traditional educational model\u2014four years of lecture halls, exams, and a diploma at the end\u2014has long been seen as the surest way to climb the social and economic ladder. But what if I told you that this long-established pathway is on the verge of extinction? AI, with its rapid advancements, is poised to make college degrees obsolete. Here\u2019s why\u2014and what will replace them. The Problem with Traditional Education Let\u2019s be honest: the current higher education system is riddled with flaws. For one, it\u2019s expensive. The average American student leaves college with over $30,000 in debt. But it\u2019s not just the financial burden; there\u2019s also the issue of relevancy. In an era where technology evolves every six months, a curriculum that takes years to develop is often outdated by the time it reaches students. Why spend four years studying when you could be learning faster, cheaper, and more effectively through alternative means? That\u2019s where AI steps in. Artificial intelligence is revolutionizing how we learn, work, and interact with information. And as AI becomes more integrated into our daily lives, the need for a traditional college degree will slowly diminish. -- -- 3 Follow Written by John Edwin --------------------- 1.1K Followers \u00b7103 Following Prolific writer, public health specialist, and tech enthusiast with 12 books on Amazon.

This inquiry delves deep into the realms of academia and industry, drawing insights from luminaries like Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, whose unconventional paths challenge the conventional wisdom surrounding the necessity of a university or college degree. Are we on the cusp of a new era where the traditional degree fades into obsolescence? The Winds of Change: Adaptation in Employability Trends Once held in high esteem, academic credentials now face scepticism in today\u2019s job market. The pivotal question arises: Is investing time and resources into a degree still a prudent choice in our swiftly changing world? The foundation beneath traditional degrees appears unstable as industries pivot towards valuing practical skills and experiential learning, recognizing them as indispensable assets in a landscape that demands adaptability and immediate impact. This transition is palpable across various sectors. In technology, coding boot camps and online certifications have gained prominence as companies prioritize candidates demonstrating practical coding proficiency and real-world project experience over those with purely theoretical knowledge from a degree. Similarly, in creative fields like digital marketing, professionals proficient in practical aspects such as social media management and data analytics are highly sought after, often acquired through workshops or hands-on experiences. Likewise, in healthcare, while medical degrees remain crucial, there\u2019s a growing emphasis on continuous learning and upskilling in specialized areas, emphasizing the fusion of theoretical knowledge and practical expertise.

Por: Inara em January 3, 2025 Advertisements Advertisements Introduction In today\u2019s rapidly evolving job market, the relevance of a four-year degree program is a topic of significant debate. Recent statistics reveal that approximately 65% of future jobs will require postsecondary education. This underscores the importance of assessing how these programs are shaping workforce readiness, especially as the dynamics within various industries continue to shift. A primary driver of these changes is the increasing complexity of roles in the workforce. For instance, jobs in technology and healthcare sectors are evolving, requiring not only specialized knowledge but also adaptability and resourcefulness. As such, institutions must evaluate and update their curricula to ensure they align closely with employer expectations. The current landscape presents several trends worth noting: Advertisements Advertisements Employer Expectations: Employers increasingly seek candidates with both technical skills and soft skills.

And talent development, especially as measured by the completion of postsecondary degrees and credentials, will become increasingly paramount to state economic development agendas in the years ahead. An astounding 85 percent of so-called \u201cgood jobs\u201d will go to workers with some form of postsecondary education or training by 2031, according to a recent report by the Center on Education and the Workforce (CEW) at Georgetown University. Only 15 percent of all good jobs will be available to workers on a high school pathway, compared to 66 percent going to workers on the bachelor\u2019s degree pathway, and 19 percent on the middle-skills pathway. The CEW defines a good job as one that pays, nationally, a minimum of $43,000 to workers ages 25-44, a minimum of $55,000 to workers ages 45-64, and a median of $82,000 for all good jobs. The report indicates that by 2031, only 36 percent of all jobs available to workers on the high school educational pathway will be good compared to 79% available to those on the bachelor's degree pathway and 52 percent for those on the middle-skills pathway. A primary takeaway from the report is that while the value of a college degree faces some skepticism, the demand for and return on investment of a bachelor\u2019s degree will continue to grow in the decade ahead.

                  "raw_content": "The Nation Is Still at Risk: The Urgency of Workforce Preparation For the last several decades, our educational system has been carefully molded to usher students from prekindergarten to college. Our current system relies on two assumptions: first, that a college-preparatory curriculum adequately prepares high school graduates for direct entry into the workforce; and second, that a college degree will guarantee a good job. But students, workers, and employers are telling us quite clearly that something is awry. Many employers can\u2019t seem to find enough skilled workers, while recent graduates don\u2019t always feel prepared to take on even entry-level work. Although the current skills mismatch might feel particularly urgent in a tight labor market, this isn\u2019t a novel concern. We could apply the following summation from the seminal \u201cA Nation at Risk\u201d report to our current anxieties: \u201cMore and more young people emerge from high school ready neither for college nor for work. This predicament becomes more acute as the knowledge base continues its rapid expansion, the number of traditional jobs shrinks, and new jobs demand greater sophistication and preparation.\u201d The only catch, of course, is that \u201cA Nation at Risk\u201d was published 40 years ago, in 1983. But swap out contexts, and the same fundamental fears hold true. Instead of fretting about the United States\u2019 industrial efficiencies being beaten out by those of South Korea, Japan, or Germany, we now worry about China and a world in which technology keeps reinventing how entire sectors of the economy function. Employers calling attention to an absence of certain skills is not a bad thing. It signals to the nation\u2019s education and policy communities what changes are needed in an ever-evolving labor market and economy. The fear of falling behind is a powerful motivator: The failures of K\u201312 as described by \u201cA Nation at Risk\u201d spurred on new reforms aimed at improving academic outcomes for all students. This was a welcome course correction from the pre-\u201cNation at Risk\u201d world, in ",

The new foundational skills of the modern economy include greater digital savvy, increased business acumen, and more versatile human and team-centered workplace competencies. These skills generate substantial salary premiums for the students and workers who master them, and demand for these skills is large and growing at all levels of educational attainment. Middle and high schools\u00a0that embrace these skills will be setting their students up for future success. However, the nature and prevalence of education in these new foundational skills during middle and high school is unclear. In this report, American Student Assistance and Burning Glass Technologies present the view from the schoolhouse: What is the value that students can gain from mastering these new foundational skills, how do educators understand the value to students that these skills offer, and how do educators feel about the quality of education in these skills that their schools provide.

This week, we hired Jay, a videographer who left school at 16 and showed a huge thirst for knowledge on our apprenticeship scheme.

A Harvard Business Review article highlights how behind-the-times colleges and universities are in adapting to the modern life. \u201cOne measure of this is that less than 5% of college budgets are dedicated to IT spending. According to U.S. Department of Education data, while one-third of all U.S. college students had some type of online course experience before the pandemic, the other two-thirds remained traditional campus-based lectures \u2014 little-changed from hundreds of years ago.\u201d As colleges and universities struggled to enact plans to manage the effects of a global health pandemic, many students were left caught in middle and frustrated with their options. And rightfully so. It shouldn\u2019t take a global health pandemic to drive necessary competition and industry-wide improvements, but it seems that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening.

To discuss the impact this is having on the higher education space, leaders from Microsoft took part in a panel discussion at THE Digital Universities UK 2023, titled \u201cHow the future of work is revolutionising the future of learning\u201d. \u201cOur mission is to empower every person and organisation to achieve more,\u201d explained Cris Bloomfield, education architect at Microsoft. \u201cThere are a set of technologies that are driving us towards this goal. Artificial intelligence is one of them, as is the Internet of Things, mixed reality, blockchain and quantum computing. Every day, universities are already using many of these.\u201d With the rapid pace of change, which is only likely to accelerate, institutions need to prepare graduates not just for the careers of today but also those of tomorrow. \u201cRecent technological advancements will impact tasks in virtually every occupational group in the future,\u201d Bloomfield said. \u201cWe need to build student confidence to adapt to an ever-changing work environment.\u201d Globally, the skills gap is pronounced but universities have an opportunity to close it. To grasp this opportunity, higher education institutions need to foster a culture of lifelong learning. One method of developing this culture involves ensuring every touchpoint between a student and the university is captured and recorded before being used to generate student-centric, actionable insights. \u201cUnderstanding the tools used by companies today was one of the most jarring things for me as I entered the workplace,\u201d admitted Lizzie Melville, Microsoft Surface specialist for higher education and healthcare at Microsoft.

This involves recognizing new realities in the academic world to stay relevant and effective. The landscape of higher education is being reshaped by several formidable challenges that necessitate a fundamental rethink of the higher education business model. To understand why change is not just necessary but imperative, it is essential to dissect the issues that are causing institutions to falter and compelling them to seek new paths to sustainability. With evolving financial models, colleges and universities\u2013beyond the Ivy League\u2013need to explore sustainable solutions that balance educational quality with fiscal responsibility. \u00a0 Shrinking Tuition Income from Declining Enrollments and Shifting Demographics One of the most pressing problems is enrollment challenges, namely the steady decline in enrollment. Universities are witnessing a worrying trend of shrinking class sizes, with current figures at 70%-80% of what they were just half a decade ago. This decline is not merely a temporary fluctuation; it\u2019s a symptom of larger demographic shifts, including reduced high school graduation rates in some regions and changes in the perceived value of traditional degree programs. For example, according to the College Board, in 2016, 70% of all high school seniors (traditional-age students) went to college. Fast forward to 2022, only 62% of graduating seniors attended college. This is a drop of 8%, which, unto itself, doesn\u2019t seem like a whole lot. B",

Certainly, the post-graduation season offers an opportunity to reflect on higher education\u2019s future.

Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a motion.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

A meta-analysis confirmed significant gains in these areas during college (Huber & Kuncel, 2016).  This development is crucial, as 82.9% of employers prioritize critical thinking in new hires (NACE, 2021).  Furthermore, improved critical thinking is linked to better academic performance and psychological adjustment, impacting real-world problem-solving and decision-making (Collegenp, 2024; Springer, 2022). These combined benefits enhance career prospects and personal development.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: A bachelor's degree opens doors to a wider range of career opportunities.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '2_5', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Average Salary With vs. Without a College Degree | Indeed.com', 'url': 'https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/average-salary-with-college-degree-vs-without'}, {'id': '2_9', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': \"10 Growing Jobs That Pay Well and Don't Need a 4-Year Degree\", 'url': 'https://blog.dol.gov/2023/11/14/10-growing-jobs-that-dont-need-a-4-year-degree'}, {'id': '2_21', 'query': \"Jobs that require a bachelor's degree\", 'title': \"What Jobs Can You Get with a Bachelor's Degree? | SNHU\", 'url': 'https://www.snhu.edu/about-us/newsroom/career/bachelors-degree-jobs'}, {'id': '2_24', 'query': \"Jobs that require a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Projected openings in occupations that require a college degree', 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2021/article/projected-openings-college-degree.htm'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Earning a bachelor's degree unlocks a wider array of career opportunities and higher earning potential.  Indeed.com advises that a bachelor's degree keeps more doors open, particularly for high-level roles or later pursuit of master's and doctoral degrees. BLS data from 2022 indicates about 70% of jobs required less than a four-year degree, emphasizing the substantial 30% requiring a bachelor's or higher. The SNHU acknowledges a bachelor's degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions. Furthermore, the BLS states most jobs requiring a bachelor's degree also offer higher median wages.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: A college degree enhances economic mobility and reduces income inequality.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_10', 'query': 'Does a college degree reduce income inequality?', 'title': 'Boosting college degrees decreases inequality, lowers poverty', 'url': 'https://www.upjohn.org/research-highlights/boosting-college-degrees-decreases-inequality-lowers-poverty'}, {'id': '5_29', 'query': 'Correlation between college degrees and economic advancement', 'title': 'The Economic Benefits of Educational Attainment - AAF', 'url': 'https://www.americanactionforum.org/project/economic-benefits-educational-attainment/'}, {'id': '5_43', 'query': 'College degrees and income inequality statistics', 'title': 'The College Wealth Divide: Education and Inequality in America, 1956 ...', 'url': 'https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/review/2020/01/17/the-college-wealth-divide-education-and-inequality-in-america-1956-2016'}, {'id': '5_44', 'query': 'College degrees and income inequality statistics', 'title': 'Learning and Earning by Degrees: Gains in College Degree Attainment ...', 'url': 'https://cew.georgetown.edu/cew-reports/attainmentgains/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce report, \"Learning and Earning by Degrees,\" demonstrates the substantial positive economic impact of increased college degree attainment. It projects $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers over their lifetimes, based on an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data.  This influx of earnings fuels economic growth through increased spending and tax revenue. While acknowledging that educational attainment alone isn't a silver bullet for economic justice, the report's comprehensive data analysis from reputable sources showcases the significant role a college degree plays in boosting individual earnings and thereby contributing to broader economic growth.  This strengthens the argument that, while diverse paths to success exist, pursuing a four-year degree remains a valuable tool for enhancing economic mobility and ultimately reducing income inequality.  Some argue that the cost of college outweighs the benefits, but this ignores the long-term return on investment and the wider economic benefits generated by a more educated workforce.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 466 words for the opening statement.

        "content": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue that, yes, a four-year college degree is still a good thing for young people these days.  We define \"pursuing a four-year college degree\" as attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree, acknowledging that various paths to success exist.  We're judging this based on how it affects young people's lives \u2013 their jobs, how they grow as people, and how they contribute to society. Basically, we believe education has lots of value in different ways.\n\nWe will present three key arguments: First, college education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Second, a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities and earning potential.  Third, a college degree promotes economic mobility and reduces income inequality.\n\nOkay, so, first things first.  College nurtures essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Picture this: you're at work, facing a really tough problem. Do you rely on gut instinct or a methodical approach? Research in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant cognitive growth during college [1]. This is not just some theory; this matters in real life. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) found that 82.9% of employers prioritize critical thinking in new hires [2].  Colleges give you the skills you need to do well in today's tough job world.  Studies in *Collegenp* and *Springer* further link improved critical thinking to better academic performance and psychological well-being, directly impacting real-world problem-solving and informed decision-making [3, 4]. And that, my friends, is super helpful for dealing with today's world.\n\nOkay, now for my second point.  Earning a bachelor's degree unlocks a wider array of career opportunities. Consider this:  Indeed.com advises that a bachelor's degree keeps more career doors open, especially for leadership positions or pursuing advanced degrees [5].  While the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data highlights various successful career paths without a four-year degree [6], a significant 30% of jobs still require a bachelor\u2019s or higher, leaving you with fewer options if you don't pursue higher education [7].  Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) reinforces that a bachelor\u2019s degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions [8]. The key thing is not just finding a job, but how much you earn.  The BLS further states that jobs requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree tend to offer higher median wages [7]. A college degree significantly enhances your earning potential and financial security.\n\nLet me turn to our final argument.  A college degree significantly impacts economic mobility and income inequality. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce demonstrates this in their report \"Learning and Earning by Degrees\" [9].  Their analysis projects a staggering $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers with college degrees over their lifetimes, based on Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data. This isn't just about individual gain.  This increased earning power fuels economic growth through higher spending and tax revenue, benefiting society as a whole.  While we acknowledge that education alone isn't a panacea for all economic challenges, the compelling data underscores the powerful role of a college degree in boosting individual earnings and contributing to broader economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-year college degree remains a powerful catalyst for positive change, equipping young adults with essential skills, expanding career horizons, and fostering economic growth.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huber, C.

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nHey everyone, we're here to argue that a four-year degree isn't always the best path for young people today. Our opponents focus on the good stuff, but they miss some big problems with degrees these days. We agree with their definition of pursuing a four-year college degree, meaning attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree.  However, we disagree with their judging criteria. Instead of focusing solely on individual growth and societal contributions, we contend that the true measure of benefit lies in the overall value proposition. It's about seeing if the time and money you spend actually pays off in today's job market. This way, we can see the whole picture better.\n\nWe will present three key counterarguments. First, the cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates. Second, online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives. Third, many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\n\nSo, first, let's talk money. College can be really expensive.  Studies in FREOPP reveal a troubling statistic: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment [1]. Think about it: one in four grads might be worse off after getting their degree.  This completely undermines the supposed financial advantages. And even when you do make money back, it often isn't much. The rising cost of tuition, as documented by College Values Online, exacerbates this issue [2].  For many young adults, the crushing weight of student loan debt can negate any potential financial gains for years, if not decades. This brings me to our second argument.\n\nLuckily, there are other great options besides a four-year degree. Online courses and certifications provide more affordable and flexible pathways to career advancement. Think of getting a great education for way less money.  As you'll see, Learn.org provides a clear cost comparison. Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions [3]. This affordability, coupled with the flexibility of online learning, makes these options a compelling alternative for today\u2019s young adults. They learn when they want, study what they need for their career, and skip the huge tuition bills.  This flexibility and affordability are critical in today's dynamic job market.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not just about affordability, but also changing notions of success. Our final argument challenges the outdated assumption that a four-year degree guarantees success. Countless individuals have achieved remarkable success without a traditional college education.  Think about tech giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as highlighted by Mashable [4]. They revolutionized the technology landscape after dropping out of college. Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, a fact detailed by Develop Good Habits [5]. These stories, and countless others, demonstrate that entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree in today's innovative economy.  They challenge the traditional narrative and offer a different perspective on success.\n\nIn conclusion, while a four-year degree may still hold value for some, it is no longer the only or even the best path to success for all. The high costs, the emergence of affordable alternatives, and the proven success of individuals without degrees all point to a changing landscape.  We urge you to consider these realities and reject the outdated notion that a four-year degree is essential for all young adults in today's society.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.  *Does College Pay Off?

You should stand firm on your position (SUPPORT the motion) and attack the opponent's weak points.\nYour position is to SUPPORT the motion. The opponent is to OPPOSE the motion.\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Structure of a Rebuttal\nA complete rebuttal should consist of multiple points, with each point containing four parts:\n- **Lead-in:** Introduce the opponent's argument, evidence, reasoning, etc., that you will be refuting.\n- **Explanation:** Briefly explain the opponent's argument to ensure clarity.\n- **Rebuttal:** This is the core of your point. Utilize rebuttal techniques to directly challenge the opponent's claim.\n- **Impact:** Concisely summarize the impact of your rebuttal and how it benefits your side.\n\nNote: Typically, the lead-in and explanation are combined into one sentence. The rebuttal is the most crucial part, and the impact summarizes its effect.\n\n### Rebuttal Techniques\n- **Pointing out logical fallacies:** Identify errors in the opponent's reasoning, such as reversing cause and effect, equivocation (shifting the meaning of a key term), straw man arguments, circular reasoning, or tautology (repeating the same idea in different words).\n- **Pointing out factual errors:** Highlight inaccuracies or weaknesses in the opponent's evidence, such as insufficient data, incorrect facts, or biased sources.\n- **Leveling the playing field:** This technique aims to neutralize the opponent's advantage or minimize the perceived harm of your side's position by demonstrating that both sides share the same issue or benefit.\n    - **Example 1:** \"You claim A, but B also has this problem.

Data from the Social Security Administration (ssa.gov) reveals a substantial earnings gap, with bachelor's degree holders earning $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates. This data demonstrates the significant financial advantage of a degree, making alternative paths less secure.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Opponents' Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"The cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates.\", \"argument\": [\"23% of bachelor\\'s degrees offer a negative return on investment (FREOPP)\", \"Rising cost of tuition (College Values Online)\", \"Crushing weight of student loan debt can negate potential financial gains\", \"Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits (Learn.org)\", \"Flexibility of online learning\", \"Affordability and flexibility are critical in today\\'s dynamic job market\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_0', 'query': 'Benefits of a four-year college degree on lifetime earnings', 'title': 'The Economic Impact of College Degrees', 'url': 'https://collegepossible.org/news/the-economic-impact-of-college-degrees/'}, {'id': '0_2', 'query': 'Benefits of a four-year college degree on lifetime earnings', 'title': 'Is It Still Worth Going to College? - San Francisco Fed', 'url': 'https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2014/05/is-college-worth-it-education-tuition-wages/'}]\n**Short Argument**: The claim that a four-year degree's cost outweighs its benefits is inaccurate for the majority.  Studies show bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime, recouping college costs. For example, they earn $2.3 million more than high school graduates (College Possible), and the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 (San Francisco Fed).  This demonstrates a clear financial advantage for degree holders.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Attacked Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"A bachelor\\'s degree opens doors to a wider range of career opportunities.\", \"argument\": [\"Indeed.com advises that a bachelor\\'s degree keeps more career doors open, especially for leadership positions or pursuing advanced degrees.\", \"Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data highlights that a significant 30% of jobs still require a bachelor\\\\u2019s or higher.\", \"Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) reinforces that a bachelor\\\\u2019s degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"23% of bachelor\\'s degrees offer a negative return on investment (FREOPP)\\\\\", \\\\\"Rising cost of tuition (College Values Online)\\\\\", \\\\\"Crushing weight of student loan debt can negate potential financial gains\\\\\", \\\\\"Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits (Learn.org)\\\\\", \\\\\"Flexibility of online learning\\\\\", \\\\\"Affordability and flexibility are critical in today\\'s dynamic job market\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives to four-year degrees.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits (Learn.org)\\\\\", \\\\\"Flexibility of online learning\\\\\", \\\\\"Affordability and flexibility are critical in today\\'s dynamic job market\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Bill Gates and Steve Jobs revolutionized technology after dropping out of college (Mashable)\\\\\", \\\\\"Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16 (Develop Good Habits)\\\\\", \\\\\"Entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_20', 'query': \"Statistics on lifetime earnings with a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Research Summary: Education and Lifetime Earnings', 'url': 'https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/research-summaries/education-earnings.html'}, {'id': '2_5', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': 'Average Salary With vs. Without a College Degree | Indeed.com', 'url': 'https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/average-salary-with-college-degree-vs-without'}, {'id': '2_7', 'query': \"Career options with a bachelor's degree vs. without a bachelor's degree\", 'title': \"Fast growth, good pay\u2014without a bachelor's degree\", 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2023/data-on-display/fast-growth-good-pay-without-a-bachelors-degree.htm'}, {'id': '2_31', 'query': \"Unemployment rates for bachelor's degree holders vs. high school diploma holders\", 'title': 'Career Outlook article page - U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics', 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/careeroutlook/2021/data-on-display/education-pays.htm'}]\n\n**Long Argument**: While alternative paths to success exist, a bachelor's degree demonstrably broadens career horizons.  The BLS, a leading source of U.S. labor market data, reveals that nearly a third of all jobs require at least a bachelor's degree (2022 data). This widespread requirement, identified through the BLS's rigorous data collection methods and publicly available via their official website, underscores the significance of a bachelor's degree for accessing numerous professional fields.  Furthermore, Indeed.com, a highly reputable job search platform with extensive insights into employer preferences, affirms the bachelor's degree as crucial for unlocking leadership roles and advanced studies.  Addressing the counterargument about cost, the long-term financial benefits, including higher earning potential and lower unemployment rates as documented by the BLS and SSA, often outweigh the initial investment.  Therefore, while individual circumstances vary, a bachelor's degree remains a powerful tool for expanding career possibilities.\n\n\n### Action: Reinforce Proposed Claim\n**Our Claims to be reinforced**: ['{\"claim\": \"Pursuing a four-year college degree at an accredited institution remains beneficial for the majority of young adults in contemporary society, offering significant advantages in terms of career prospects, personal development, and societal contribution, recognizing that diverse pathways to success exist and acknowledging the need for continued investment in affordable and accessible higher education.\", \"argument\": [\"Pursuing a four-year college degree at an accredited institution remains beneficial for the majority of young adults in contemporary society, offering significant advantages in terms of career prospects, personal development, and societal contribution, recognizing that diverse pathways to success exist and acknowledging the need for continued investment in affordable and accessible higher education.\", \"Cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills (supported by research and employer demand).\", \"Expands career opportunities and earning potential (backed by job market data and industry insights).\", \"Promotes economic mobility and reduces income inequality (evidenced by economic studies and projections).\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_43', 'query': 'Unemployment rates for those with a four-year degree vs. those without', 'title': 'High school graduates with no college had unemployment rate of 4.5 ...', 'url': 'https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2022/high-school-graduates-with-no-college-had-unemployment-rate-of-4-5-percent-in-february-2022.htm'}, {'id': '1_11', 'query': 'Does college improve critical thinking skills?', 'title': 'Does College Teach Critical Thinking?

        "content": "Look, they've got a point about college costs, but they're missing the big picture \u2013 the long-term payoff. They talk about successful dropouts, but that's not the whole story, right?  So, let's tackle their points one by one, okay?\n\nThey say a degree isn't worth the money, pointing to folks who didn't get a good return.  But, you know, studies show that's not typical. Studies from College Possible demonstrate that bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime\u2014a whopping $2.3 million more than high school graduates [1].  The San Francisco Fed adds that the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 [2].  So, while costs are real, the long-term financial benefits are clear.\n\nThey highlight online courses and certifications as affordable alternatives. Sure, online courses teach you stuff, but they don't give you the same solid education and recognition as a degree.  Imagine this: You're trying to get a job, right?  Who gets a closer look, the candidate with a recognized degree or one with various online certifications? A degree holds weight, opening doors to more opportunities.\n\nThey showcase successful dropouts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  These stories are inspiring, yeah, but they're not how things usually go. Data from the Social Security Administration shows a substantial earnings gap. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates [3]. These outliers shouldn\u2019t overshadow the statistically proven financial advantage of a degree.\n\nOkay, so, let's go back over what we've talked about.  We\u2019ve shown that a college education cultivates vital skills. Think about yourself facing a tough problem at work. A meta-analysis in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant gains in critical thinking during college [4].  These skills are crucial for navigating today's complex world. Furthermore, 82.9% of employers say they want this very skill in new hires [5]. This means your investment in education is an investment in your future career.\n\nWe've also shown that a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics states almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree [6].  This isn't just about numbers, it's about your future. With a degree, you are prepared for the workforce and its evolving demands.  This directly impacts your earning potential, as highlighted by Indeed.com, by opening up more high-level positions [7]. They also stated that without the proper credentials, opportunities are limited, especially higher management roles or those requiring advanced study. This higher earning potential contributes to economic stability and long-term financial security, making a degree a worthwhile investment.\n\nFinally, we've shown how a college degree enhances economic mobility.  The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, using robust Census and education data, projects trillions in added earnings for college graduates [8].  This fuels economic growth and benefits society.  They further emphasized education's essential role in social mobility, enhancing one's capacity to improve their economic circumstances. This reinforces the link between a college education and improved financial outcomes, contributing to a stronger economy overall.\n\nIn conclusion, while alternative paths exist, a four-year college degree offers significant advantages in terms of skills development, career prospects, and economic mobility. These long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs, making it a valuable investment for young adults in today\u2019s world.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] College Possible.

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nThey mention long-term gains, right? But, they totally forget how expensive a four-year degree is right now. They say degrees guarantee success, but let's be honest, that's just not how it works. Okay, so let's tackle their arguments directly.  They brush off successful dropouts, but those stories are real.  While they cite statistics about higher earnings for graduates, Praxis profiles 125 successful individuals without degrees, across many fields [1]. These aren't just exceptions; they're proof that success doesn't always need a degree. And this leads me to their main point on long-term value.\n\nThey highlight this $2.3 million lifetime earning thing, but honestly, that's missing a lot. Consider this: the FREOPP study reveals a stark reality \u2013 nearly a quarter of bachelor's degrees lead to a negative return on investment [2].  And it gets worse: a staggering 43% of both two-year and master's degrees fail to deliver any financial gain.  So, before you bank on that $2.3 million, remember the significant number of graduates struggling to even break even. The rosy picture they paint ignores these stark statistics.\n\nThey're all about critical thinking from college, but where's the proof it helps you get a job?  They cite studies showing cognitive growth during college, but what good is that if graduates can't find suitable jobs? Research indicates a stark reality: 52% of recent college graduates are underemployed [3]. This means their expensive degrees aren't translating into fulfilling careers. It\u2019s not just about learning to think critically; it's about being able to use those skills in a job that values them.  This brings me to their argument about online alternatives.\n\nThey say online courses aren't worth much, but employers are starting to think differently. They talk about prestige, but is a degree you're drowning in debt for really better than skills employers need?  Learn.org's data reveals that online credits cost significantly less \u2013 sometimes thousands less per credit \u2013 than traditional college, both public and private [4].  This financial advantage lets you invest in yourself without crippling debt.  Furthermore, platforms like Continents.us emphasize the benefits of flexible online learning.  You control your pace and focus on skills directly relevant to the job market, something traditional degrees often miss. And let\u2019s not forget: increasingly, employers prioritize skills over degrees, as Forbes highlights [5].  So, while a degree might look good on paper, demonstrable skills land you the job. This leads us back to the financial reality of college.\n\nThey say you'll earn back tuition by 40, but that ignores the huge problems of high costs and big loans. College Values Online data shows tuition has increased by a whopping 747.8% since 1963 [6]. That's astronomical! This financial strain is made worse by student loan debt, averaging over $37,000 per borrower [7].  This crushing debt burden can delay major life milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or even just saving for retirement.  It's a financial anchor that can weigh you down for decades, severely limiting your financial freedom and future prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge the shifting landscape of education and the job market. The increasing costs, the emergence of viable alternatives, and the proven success of non-graduates demonstrate that a four-year degree isn't essential for everyone.  We urge you to consider these points and reject the notion that college is the only path to success.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Praxis. *125 Successful People Who Didn\u2019t Graduate College*. https://discoverpraxis.com/blog/13067/125-successful-people-who-didnt-graduate-college\n[2] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. *Does College Pay Off?

Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nHey everyone, we're here today to argue that, yes, a four-year college degree is still a good thing for young people these days.  We define \"pursuing a four-year college degree\" as attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree, acknowledging that various paths to success exist.  We're judging this based on how it affects young people's lives \u2013 their jobs, how they grow as people, and how they contribute to society. Basically, we believe education has lots of value in different ways.\n\nWe will present three key arguments: First, college education cultivates critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Second, a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities and earning potential.  Third, a college degree promotes economic mobility and reduces income inequality.\n\nOkay, so, first things first.  College nurtures essential critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Picture this: you're at work, facing a really tough problem. Do you rely on gut instinct or a methodical approach? Research in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant cognitive growth during college [1]. This is not just some theory; this matters in real life. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) found that 82.9% of employers prioritize critical thinking in new hires [2].  Colleges give you the skills you need to do well in today's tough job world.  Studies in *Collegenp* and *Springer* further link improved critical thinking to better academic performance and psychological well-being, directly impacting real-world problem-solving and informed decision-making [3, 4]. And that, my friends, is super helpful for dealing with today's world.\n\nOkay, now for my second point.  Earning a bachelor's degree unlocks a wider array of career opportunities. Consider this:  Indeed.com advises that a bachelor's degree keeps more career doors open, especially for leadership positions or pursuing advanced degrees [5].  While the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data highlights various successful career paths without a four-year degree [6], a significant 30% of jobs still require a bachelor\u2019s or higher, leaving you with fewer options if you don't pursue higher education [7].  Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU) reinforces that a bachelor\u2019s degree makes you more marketable across various industries and positions [8]. The key thing is not just finding a job, but how much you earn.  The BLS further states that jobs requiring a bachelor\u2019s degree tend to offer higher median wages [7]. A college degree significantly enhances your earning potential and financial security.\n\nLet me turn to our final argument.  A college degree significantly impacts economic mobility and income inequality. The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce demonstrates this in their report \"Learning and Earning by Degrees\" [9].  Their analysis projects a staggering $14.2 trillion in added net earnings for workers with college degrees over their lifetimes, based on Census Bureau and National Center for Education Statistics data. This isn't just about individual gain.  This increased earning power fuels economic growth through higher spending and tax revenue, benefiting society as a whole.  While we acknowledge that education alone isn't a panacea for all economic challenges, the compelling data underscores the powerful role of a college degree in boosting individual earnings and contributing to broader economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, a four-year college degree remains a powerful catalyst for positive change, equipping young adults with essential skills, expanding career horizons, and fostering economic growth.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huber, C.

Present only the final text.\n\n## Definition of the motion\n\n\n## Plan\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: The cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '1_0', 'query': 'Return on investment of a four year college degree', 'title': 'Does College Pay Off? A Comprehensive Return On Investment ... - FREOPP', 'url': 'https://freopp.org/whitepapers/does-college-pay-off-a-comprehensive-return-on-investment-analysis/'}, {'id': '1_10', 'query': 'Cost of college tuition over time', 'title': 'Rising Costs: Cost Of College Degree Over Time', 'url': 'https://www.collegevaluesonline.com/costs/degree-over-time/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Data from FREOPP indicates a concerning trend: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment, meaning graduates may actually lose money. This directly contradicts the assumed financial benefits of a four-year degree.  Furthermore, even for profitable degrees, the returns can be modest.  With rising tuition costs, documented by sources like College Values Online, the financial burden can overshadow the potential gains for many.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Online courses and certifications offer affordable and flexible alternatives to traditional four-year programs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_0', 'query': 'Cost comparison of online courses/certifications vs. traditional 4-year college degrees', 'title': 'Online College Vs. Traditional Cost Comparison - Learn.org', 'url': 'https://learn.org/articles/online_college_vs_traditional_college_cost.html'}]\n**Short Argument**: Online courses and certifications offer significantly lower costs compared to traditional four-year degrees, providing a more affordable path to career advancement.  Learn.org's cost comparison shows online credits costing substantially less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions.  This affordability, combined with flexible learning options, makes them strong alternatives.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_1', 'query': 'successful people without college degrees', 'title': \"51 Successful People Who Didn't Go to or Finish College\", 'url': 'https://www.developgoodhabits.com/successful-people-college/'}, {'id': '4_5', 'query': 'famous entrepreneurs who dropped out of college', 'title': '12 of the most successful entrepreneurs who dropped out of college', 'url': 'https://mashable.com/article/12-entrepreneurs-who-dropped-out-of-college'}, {'id': '4_6', 'query': 'famous entrepreneurs who dropped out of college', 'title': \"51 Successful People Who Didn't Go to or Finish College\", 'url': 'https://www.developgoodhabits.com/successful-people-college/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The idea that a four-year degree guarantees success is increasingly outdated. Numerous individuals have achieved significant success without completing college.  Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, highlighted in Mashable, revolutionized technology after dropping out.  Similarly, Richard Branson, founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, as detailed by Develop Good Habits. These examples, alongside others mentioned in various sources, demonstrate that drive, innovation, and self-education can be more impactful than formal degrees.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 481 words for the opening statement. After achieving exactly 481 words, add the Reference section. Present only these two elements with no additional text."

        "content": "Hey everyone, we're here to argue that a four-year degree isn't always the best path for young people today. Our opponents focus on the good stuff, but they miss some big problems with degrees these days. We agree with their definition of pursuing a four-year college degree, meaning attending an accredited institution to obtain a bachelor's degree.  However, we disagree with their judging criteria. Instead of focusing solely on individual growth and societal contributions, we contend that the true measure of benefit lies in the overall value proposition. It's about seeing if the time and money you spend actually pays off in today's job market. This way, we can see the whole picture better.\n\nWe will present three key counterarguments. First, the cost of a four-year degree outweighs its financial benefits for many graduates. Second, online courses and certifications offer more affordable and flexible alternatives. Third, many successful individuals in various fields have not completed four-year degrees, proving alternative paths to success exist.\n\nSo, first, let's talk money. College can be really expensive.  Studies in FREOPP reveal a troubling statistic: 23% of bachelor's degrees offer a negative return on investment [1]. Think about it: one in four grads might be worse off after getting their degree.  This completely undermines the supposed financial advantages. And even when you do make money back, it often isn't much. The rising cost of tuition, as documented by College Values Online, exacerbates this issue [2].  For many young adults, the crushing weight of student loan debt can negate any potential financial gains for years, if not decades. This brings me to our second argument.\n\nLuckily, there are other great options besides a four-year degree. Online courses and certifications provide more affordable and flexible pathways to career advancement. Think of getting a great education for way less money.  As you'll see, Learn.org provides a clear cost comparison. Online credits cost significantly less than in-person credits, both at public and private institutions [3]. This affordability, coupled with the flexibility of online learning, makes these options a compelling alternative for today\u2019s young adults. They learn when they want, study what they need for their career, and skip the huge tuition bills.  This flexibility and affordability are critical in today's dynamic job market.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not just about affordability, but also changing notions of success. Our final argument challenges the outdated assumption that a four-year degree guarantees success. Countless individuals have achieved remarkable success without a traditional college education.  Think about tech giants like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs, as highlighted by Mashable [4]. They revolutionized the technology landscape after dropping out of college. Similarly, Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Group, left school at 16, a fact detailed by Develop Good Habits [5]. These stories, and countless others, demonstrate that entrepreneurial spirit, self-education, and real-world experience can be more valuable than a formal degree in today's innovative economy.  They challenge the traditional narrative and offer a different perspective on success.\n\nIn conclusion, while a four-year degree may still hold value for some, it is no longer the only or even the best path to success for all. The high costs, the emergence of affordable alternatives, and the proven success of individuals without degrees all point to a changing landscape.  We urge you to consider these realities and reject the outdated notion that a four-year degree is essential for all young adults in today's society.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity.  *Does College Pay Off?

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nLook, they've got a point about college costs, but they're missing the big picture \u2013 the long-term payoff. They talk about successful dropouts, but that's not the whole story, right?  So, let's tackle their points one by one, okay?\n\nThey say a degree isn't worth the money, pointing to folks who didn't get a good return.  But, you know, studies show that's not typical. Studies from College Possible demonstrate that bachelor's degree holders earn significantly more over their lifetime\u2014a whopping $2.3 million more than high school graduates [1].  The San Francisco Fed adds that the average graduate recoups tuition costs by age 40 [2].  So, while costs are real, the long-term financial benefits are clear.\n\nThey highlight online courses and certifications as affordable alternatives. Sure, online courses teach you stuff, but they don't give you the same solid education and recognition as a degree.  Imagine this: You're trying to get a job, right?  Who gets a closer look, the candidate with a recognized degree or one with various online certifications? A degree holds weight, opening doors to more opportunities.\n\nThey showcase successful dropouts like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.  These stories are inspiring, yeah, but they're not how things usually go. Data from the Social Security Administration shows a substantial earnings gap. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates [3]. These outliers shouldn\u2019t overshadow the statistically proven financial advantage of a degree.\n\nOkay, so, let's go back over what we've talked about.  We\u2019ve shown that a college education cultivates vital skills. Think about yourself facing a tough problem at work. A meta-analysis in *Review of Educational Research* confirms significant gains in critical thinking during college [4].  These skills are crucial for navigating today's complex world. Furthermore, 82.9% of employers say they want this very skill in new hires [5]. This means your investment in education is an investment in your future career.\n\nWe've also shown that a bachelor's degree expands career opportunities.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics states almost a third of jobs require a four-year degree [6].  This isn't just about numbers, it's about your future. With a degree, you are prepared for the workforce and its evolving demands.  This directly impacts your earning potential, as highlighted by Indeed.com, by opening up more high-level positions [7]. They also stated that without the proper credentials, opportunities are limited, especially higher management roles or those requiring advanced study. This higher earning potential contributes to economic stability and long-term financial security, making a degree a worthwhile investment.\n\nFinally, we've shown how a college degree enhances economic mobility.  The Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce, using robust Census and education data, projects trillions in added earnings for college graduates [8].  This fuels economic growth and benefits society.  They further emphasized education's essential role in social mobility, enhancing one's capacity to improve their economic circumstances. This reinforces the link between a college education and improved financial outcomes, contributing to a stronger economy overall.\n\nIn conclusion, while alternative paths exist, a four-year college degree offers significant advantages in terms of skills development, career prospects, and economic mobility. These long-term benefits outweigh the initial costs, making it a valuable investment for young adults in today\u2019s world.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] College Possible.

        "content": "They mention long-term gains, right? But, they totally forget how expensive a four-year degree is right now. They say degrees guarantee success, but let's be honest, that's just not how it works. Okay, so let's tackle their arguments directly.  They brush off successful dropouts, but those stories are real.  While they cite statistics about higher earnings for graduates, Praxis profiles 125 successful individuals without degrees, across many fields [1]. These aren't just exceptions; they're proof that success doesn't always need a degree. And this leads me to their main point on long-term value.\n\nThey highlight this $2.3 million lifetime earning thing, but honestly, that's missing a lot. Consider this: the FREOPP study reveals a stark reality \u2013 nearly a quarter of bachelor's degrees lead to a negative return on investment [2].  And it gets worse: a staggering 43% of both two-year and master's degrees fail to deliver any financial gain.  So, before you bank on that $2.3 million, remember the significant number of graduates struggling to even break even. The rosy picture they paint ignores these stark statistics.\n\nThey're all about critical thinking from college, but where's the proof it helps you get a job?  They cite studies showing cognitive growth during college, but what good is that if graduates can't find suitable jobs? Research indicates a stark reality: 52% of recent college graduates are underemployed [3]. This means their expensive degrees aren't translating into fulfilling careers. It\u2019s not just about learning to think critically; it's about being able to use those skills in a job that values them.  This brings me to their argument about online alternatives.\n\nThey say online courses aren't worth much, but employers are starting to think differently. They talk about prestige, but is a degree you're drowning in debt for really better than skills employers need?  Learn.org's data reveals that online credits cost significantly less \u2013 sometimes thousands less per credit \u2013 than traditional college, both public and private [4].  This financial advantage lets you invest in yourself without crippling debt.  Furthermore, platforms like Continents.us emphasize the benefits of flexible online learning.  You control your pace and focus on skills directly relevant to the job market, something traditional degrees often miss. And let\u2019s not forget: increasingly, employers prioritize skills over degrees, as Forbes highlights [5].  So, while a degree might look good on paper, demonstrable skills land you the job. This leads us back to the financial reality of college.\n\nThey say you'll earn back tuition by 40, but that ignores the huge problems of high costs and big loans. College Values Online data shows tuition has increased by a whopping 747.8% since 1963 [6]. That's astronomical! This financial strain is made worse by student loan debt, averaging over $37,000 per borrower [7].  This crushing debt burden can delay major life milestones like homeownership, starting a family, or even just saving for retirement.  It's a financial anchor that can weigh you down for decades, severely limiting your financial freedom and future prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge the shifting landscape of education and the job market. The increasing costs, the emergence of viable alternatives, and the proven success of non-graduates demonstrate that a four-year degree isn't essential for everyone.  We urge you to consider these points and reject the notion that college is the only path to success.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Praxis. *125 Successful People Who Didn\u2019t Graduate College*. https://discoverpraxis.com/blog/13067/125-successful-people-who-didnt-graduate-college\n[2] Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity. *Does College Pay Off?

They focused on costs, exceptions, not the bigger, long-term picture.  Let\u2019s recap.\n\nThey highlighted the financial burden of college, citing cases of negative return on investment.  But, they ignored strong evidence: grads earn more over a lifetime.  College Possible, San Francisco Fed show it: a degree's a smart investment, better finances long-term [1, 2].  Think about your future; a degree provides financial security and opens doors to higher-paying jobs.\n\nThey showed us successful folks without degrees, right? Saying other paths are just as good.  Sure, many paths to success, but these stories don't change facts: degrees boost earnings, cut joblessness [3].  Consider this: you're applying for a job. A degree gives you an edge, showcasing your commitment to learning and skill development.\n\nWe've shown degrees give you key skills, like thinking critically, stuff employers want.  Research shows: college boosts brainpower, helps your career, problem-solving [4, 5]. Imagine navigating today\u2019s complex challenges. These skills are invaluable, both professionally and personally.\n\nFinally, we've demonstrated the broader societal benefits of higher education. More educated workers mean better economy, less income inequality [6].  This isn't just about individual gain; it's about building a stronger, more prosperous society for everyone.\n\nA four-year degree is an investment \u2013 in yourself, your future, and our collective future.

It empowers you, expands your opportunities, and contributes to a better future for all.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] College Possible.

We say no, embracing a more realistic view of today\u2019s world.  They talk about earning more later, but ignore the crazy debt that grads face.  Average earnings, sure, but what about those 23% who lose money on their degree? [1]  Tuition's insane, right? Up almost 750% since '63. [2]  What about the $37,000 average student loan debt [3]?  This isn't rare; it's real life for so many young people today. They say successful people without degrees are just, like, exceptions. Yet, 125 successful entrepreneurs, innovators, and leaders built empires without stepping foot on a college campus [4].  These are not anomalies; they\u2019re proof that drive and ingenuity can trump a diploma.\n\nOur opponents emphasize critical thinking skills gained in college. But really, does this lead to career success? I don't see it.  Half of recent grads are underemployed [5]. College just isn't prepping them for jobs today. It's obvious.  We\u2019ve shown that online courses and certifications offer affordable, flexible alternatives, focused on the skills employers actually demand. These programs empower you to learn at your own pace, focus on relevant skills, and avoid mountains of debt. They offer a practical pathway to a fulfilling career, tailored to your needs and aspirations.  So, ask yourselves, what truly matters: a piece of paper or the skills to thrive in the real world?  In our fast-changing world, you know, adapting and real skills really matter.  Don't let outdated notions of success dictate your future.
