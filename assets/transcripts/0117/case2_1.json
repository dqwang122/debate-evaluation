      "content": "Look, everyone, we're here today to talk about a big change needed in college sports \u2013 making things fairer and giving athletes the recognition they deserve. We firmly support the motion that student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue.\n\nFirst off, let's be clear about what we're talking about here.  We're talking about D1 athletes in sports that bring in money \u2013 mainly football and men's and women's basketball.  These athletes should get a cut of the money their sport makes, paid out through a trust fund that's run by someone else. They'd get the money after they graduate or leave, based on a formula anyone can see that looks at how much money the sport makes, how well the team does, and how much each athlete contributes.  Importantly, this keeps things fair for men and women and keeps college athletes amateur \u2013 no endorsements or talking to pro teams while they're in school.\n\nThe question we're asking is simple but important: Does this make college sports fairer and better for the future? We believe it unequivocally does. Think about this: is it really fair that these young athletes, many from poor backgrounds, aren't paid when they're the ones making the system work?\n\nWe're making three main points here. First, paying athletes recognizes how much they do for this huge, multi-billion dollar industry. Secondly, sharing revenue enhances the image and reputation of college sports. And finally, profit-sharing empowers student-athletes financially, preparing them for life beyond the game.\n\nLet me turn to our first point.  The NCAA generates staggering revenue, primarily from men\u2019s basketball. Studies in ESPN show nearly $1.28 billion was generated in 2022-23 [1]. This huge number shows just how much money college sports makes.  Who makes this happen? The athletes.  Their dedication and talent bring in the fans, sponsors, and TV viewers. Compensating them directly recognizes their integral role in this multi-billion dollar enterprise.\n\nThis brings me to our second point. Sharing the money with athletes is what people want; they want fair pay.  Research in Seton Hall Sports Poll indicates that more than half of Americans now support payments to athletes in revenue-generating sports [2].  This evolving public opinion underscores the need for change. Imagine you're a great athlete, working so hard, making millions for your school, but you can't even pay your bills. How would that feel? This shift in public perception is crucial. It fosters a more positive view of college sports, moving away from the narrative of exploitation toward a model of equity and transparency.  This improved image strengthens the integrity and long-term viability of college athletics.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the financial empowerment of student-athletes, our third point. What's really important is that this money helps athletes, especially those from families who don't have a lot.  As explained in \"Revenue Sharing: What It Means for College Athletes\", this compensation extends beyond scholarships, offering crucial financial stability [3]. Imagine you\u2019re a first-generation college student balancing rigorous academics with the demands of a high-level sport.  The added financial security allows athletes to focus on their studies, internships, and future careers, ensuring a smoother transition to life after college.  It levels the playing field, offering opportunities that extend far beyond the game.\n\nIn conclusion, compensating student-athletes is not merely a matter of fairness; it\u2019s a matter of building a more sustainable and ethical future for college sports.  It recognizes their invaluable contributions, enhances the image of college athletics, and empowers these young individuals for life beyond the court or field.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in championing a more just and equitable future for college sports.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] ESPN. (n.d.).

      "content": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue against paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits. Sure, it sounds nice at first, but looking closer, there are some serious downsides \u2013 it could really hurt athletic departments and universities financially.  The proponents have suggested a complex system of payouts through trust funds, but this does not address the fundamental issues we will raise.\n\nBefore we get started, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. We're on the same page about focusing on Division I athletes in big-money sports like football and basketball. We should be thinking about how this affects everyone on campus \u2013 athletes, students, academics, and the university's bottom line. It's essential to look at the bigger picture so we can make a smart choice here.\n\nHere\u2019s our case in three points: One, paying athletes could destabilize athletic department finances. Two, doing this creates a huge administrative headache. And three, it opens universities up to major legal and financial risks.\n\nOkay, so first up: how paying athletes could create financial instability. The Wall Street Journal found many college athletic departments are already running on thin ice, money-wise [1].  Giving a chunk of that revenue to athletes, as suggested, would just make things worse. Think about it: if they\u2019re already struggling, how can they pay athletes too?  This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports, impacting a wider range of student-athletes. It could also force reductions in coaching staff and support services, ultimately harming the quality of athletic programs.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the nightmare of actually making this work.  Keepr.io shows how complicated it is to track where all the money goes with profit-sharing [2].  Imagine figuring out each athlete's cut based on how well they play, how the team does, and gender equity rules.  This creates mountains of paperwork, eats up money, and could take away resources from teaching and learning.  This means less money for classrooms, libraries, and research \u2013 resources that benefit all students, not just athletes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the legal and financial liability that profit-sharing creates, our third point. The proponents\u2019 argument relies on classifying student-athletes as employees.  However, this classification triggers significant legal ramifications, particularly regarding worker\u2019s compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation [3].  Given the inherent risks in college sports, the frequency of injuries is high.  Universities would face a substantial increase in worker\u2019s compensation claims.  Imagine you're a university administrator.  How do you budget for the unpredictable costs associated with athlete injuries? This financial burden is further explored in articles like \"College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing\" and \"Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox,\" both published on AthleticDirectorU [4, 5].  These articles highlight the already rising expenses in college athletics and the financial pressures faced by non-profit institutions. Adding worker\u2019s compensation claims to this equation could cripple athletic department budgets.  While some might argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, this is a risky gamble. The unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and injury rates makes this an unstable foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of compensating student-athletes may seem appealing, the practical implications of profit-sharing are fraught with financial, operational, and legal challenges. We urge you to consider the broader impact on the university ecosystem and vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huron Consulting Group. (n.d.).

      "content": "Look, everyone, let's be real: they're talking about financial disaster and administrative mess, but their points just don't stick. They\u2019re missing out on what revenue sharing can do \u2013 it\u2019s meant to help everyone involved, right?\n\nThey claim paying athletes will bankrupt athletic departments, citing the Wall Street Journal.  But they\u2019re missing something big: Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances [1].  Get great players, get more wins, more fans, and more money \u2013 growing revenue, not losing it.  Think about it.  A winning team brings in more money. A good athletic program makes the school look better, you know, attracting more students and boosting donations. It's a win-win.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about this so-called administrative nightmare of theirs. They claim tracking revenue and distributing profits will be overly complex, citing Keepr.io.  But they\u2019re ignoring models that already work, you know. Studies show systems like ours, based on percentages, are manageable and efficient [2, 3].  Imagine a system capped at a reasonable amount, say \\$22 million \u2013 this simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.  Pro sports do revenue sharing just fine; so can colleges, right? They've got this whole thing backward.  This system isn't about creating more work; it's about bringing fairness and transparency to how these billions of dollars are distributed.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not calling student-athletes employees.  So, their worker\u2019s comp argument, from \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" doesn\u2019t apply. Our model uses a trust fund, with payouts after graduation or leaving the program. This keeps things amateur, avoiding the legal and financial risks they mentioned. Picture a transparent system with a clear formula, you know, watched by someone independent. This is responsible money management and fair distribution, not a free-for-all on lawsuits.  This directly addresses ethical concerns about fair compensation and ensures compliance with Title IX.  \n\nRemember, they brought up the financial struggles of some athletic departments.  Let's consider this: ESPN reported that the NCAA made nearly $1.3 billion in 2022-23, mostly from men\u2019s basketball [4].  Student-athletes are the heart and soul of this massive industry.  Their talent and dedication draw the fans and generate this revenue.  Imagine being a student-athlete, pouring your heart into your sport, generating millions for your school, but struggling financially. Paying them isn\u2019t about creating a burden; it\u2019s about acknowledging their contributions and sharing the wealth they help create. Our system addresses their concerns by tying compensation directly to the revenue generated.  It's a fair and responsible approach.\n\nFinally, they completely miss the mark on the bigger picture. This isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about fairness, recognizing the immense contributions of these young athletes. Think about the sacrifices they make, balancing rigorous training schedules with academic demands.  Delayed payouts through a trust fund encourage responsible financial planning and academic focus.  This is about empowering student-athletes for life after college, providing a financial safety net as they transition to their next chapter. This is about fairness, opportunity, and investing in the future of these young people who dedicate so much to their universities.\n\nIn conclusion, revenue sharing isn\u2019t a threat to college sports; it\u2019s an opportunity to build a better future. A future that\u2019s fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in creating a more just and sustainable model for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Seattle PI. (n.d.).

      "content": "They keep saying it's a win-win, but they're ignoring some serious money problems. They say sharing money helps schools, and they mention Seattle PI. But let's be real here.  EAB reports show many athletic departments are already in trouble, lots of Power Five schools are losing money [1].  Paying athletes will probably make things worse, maybe even leading to cuts and instability.  They're optimistic about more money, but winning isn't a sure thing, and even good programs can have money problems.  Imagine your team has a bad season. Suddenly, that extra money's gone, leaving the athletic department in more trouble.\n\nThey say their system is simple, easy to run, pointing to pro sports. But here's the difference: pro sports make money, universities are for education.  Keepr.io shows how complex profit-sharing is, needing complex accounting and legal stuff [2].  Imagine tracking every athlete, team results, gender equity, and following all the rules. This extra work will take money from important things like academics and research.  They also forget about college sports rules, which makes their \"simple\" system more complex.  Comparing it to pro sports hides the administrative mess this would actually be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about their trust fund idea, their answer to workers' compensation.  They say it keeps athletes amateur.  But Bloomberg Law shows us legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening, even without employee status [3].  A $2.75 billion settlement, anyone?  This suggests that the legal risks they dismiss are very real, regardless of how they structure the payments.  A trust fund doesn't magically erase the potential for lawsuits.  So, their claim that this avoids legal issues just doesn't hold up. Imagine you're a university facing a lawsuit from a former athlete, trust fund or not.  The legal costs and potential damage to the university's reputation are significant, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis brings me back to the financial instability of athletic departments. We\u2019ve established that many athletic departments are already struggling. The Wall Street Journal, citing Huron Consulting, found that less than half of Power Five athletic departments, the wealthiest in college sports, have adequate financial reserves [4].  Adding a substantial new expense like athlete compensation would likely exacerbate existing financial difficulties. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and staff, as highlighted by Kutak Rock\u2019s analysis, impacting opportunities for students and the university community [5].  Think about it, if departments are already struggling, how can they afford to share revenue?  The supposed revenue boost from winning is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t guarantee financial stability.  In fact, EAB points out the pressure to win can lead to overspending and even greater financial risk [1].\n\nThey talk about fairness and recognizing contributions.  Yes, student-athletes work hard. But universities already invest in them through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  The current system, though imperfect, provides substantial support. Profit-sharing adds an immense financial burden that threatens the stability of entire athletic programs, impacting not just athletes but the broader university community.  Imagine your school having to cut academic programs or increase tuition to cover the costs of profit-sharing. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, their arguments for profit-sharing fail to address the complex realities of college athletics.  The financial risks, administrative burdens, and legal vulnerabilities are simply too great to ignore.  We urge you to vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

NCAA revenues rose from about $1.14 billion in the previous fiscal year to $1.28 billion. As usual, the bulk of the NCAA's revenue -- $945 million -- came from media rights and marketing deals tied to championship events. The NCAA's deal with CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery for rights to the men's Division I basketball tournament accounts for about $900 million annually. That means the men's tournament brought in about 69% of the NCAA's revenue. The value of the television deal increases yearly and the statements project an increase to more than $1 billion in 2025. The NCAA's expenses reached $1.17 billion, which includes $669 million distributed to the 363 Division I member schools and another $192 million to stage Division I championship events, the men's basketball National Invitational Tournament and other related programs. More than $100 million was also spent on Division II and III championships and programs, including some distributions back to Division II schools. The NCAA has no direct involvement in the operation of the top tier of Division I football, known as the Bowl Subdivision, and the College Football Playoff that determines its champion and brings in about $470 million annually to the conferences that participate. The NCAA is facing at least five antitrust lawsuits, which challenge rules regulating recruiting, athlete transfers and compensation for athletes. House vs. NCAA was recently class certified and could put the association on the hook for a potential multibillion-dollar payout to former and current college athletes. ",

Public opinion on this issue was also sharply divided along political lines. \"Both college sports fans and non-sports fans were in agreement on their support for athletes making money from their own image or likeness -- at 62% and 59% respectively -- but there were differences by political affiliation, with 69% of Democrats and 61% of independents supporting the idea, compared with 42% of Republicans,\" a blog post by the Bucknell institute stated. \"Both fans and non-fans were equally opposed to paying college athletes directly from university funds at 43% and 45% respectively, with 61% of Republicans opposing it, compared to 33% of Democrats.

        "statements": "Look, everyone, we're here today to talk about a big change needed in college sports \u2013 making things fairer and giving athletes the recognition they deserve. We firmly support the motion that student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue.\n\nFirst off, let's be clear about what we're talking about here.  We're talking about D1 athletes in sports that bring in money \u2013 mainly football and men's and women's basketball.  These athletes should get a cut of the money their sport makes, paid out through a trust fund that's run by someone else. They'd get the money after they graduate or leave, based on a formula anyone can see that looks at how much money the sport makes, how well the team does, and how much each athlete contributes.  Importantly, this keeps things fair for men and women and keeps college athletes amateur \u2013 no endorsements or talking to pro teams while they're in school.\n\nThe question we're asking is simple but important: Does this make college sports fairer and better for the future? We believe it unequivocally does. Think about this: is it really fair that these young athletes, many from poor backgrounds, aren't paid when they're the ones making the system work?\n\nWe're making three main points here. First, paying athletes recognizes how much they do for this huge, multi-billion dollar industry. Secondly, sharing revenue enhances the image and reputation of college sports. And finally, profit-sharing empowers student-athletes financially, preparing them for life beyond the game.\n\nLet me turn to our first point.  The NCAA generates staggering revenue, primarily from men\u2019s basketball. Studies in ESPN show nearly $1.28 billion was generated in 2022-23 [1]. This huge number shows just how much money college sports makes.  Who makes this happen? The athletes.  Their dedication and talent bring in the fans, sponsors, and TV viewers. Compensating them directly recognizes their integral role in this multi-billion dollar enterprise.\n\nThis brings me to our second point. Sharing the money with athletes is what people want; they want fair pay.  Research in Seton Hall Sports Poll indicates that more than half of Americans now support payments to athletes in revenue-generating sports [2].  This evolving public opinion underscores the need for change. Imagine you're a great athlete, working so hard, making millions for your school, but you can't even pay your bills. How would that feel? This shift in public perception is crucial. It fosters a more positive view of college sports, moving away from the narrative of exploitation toward a model of equity and transparency.  This improved image strengthens the integrity and long-term viability of college athletics.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the financial empowerment of student-athletes, our third point. What's really important is that this money helps athletes, especially those from families who don't have a lot.  As explained in \"Revenue Sharing: What It Means for College Athletes\", this compensation extends beyond scholarships, offering crucial financial stability [3]. Imagine you\u2019re a first-generation college student balancing rigorous academics with the demands of a high-level sport.  The added financial security allows athletes to focus on their studies, internships, and future careers, ensuring a smoother transition to life after college.  It levels the playing field, offering opportunities that extend far beyond the game.\n\nIn conclusion, compensating student-athletes is not merely a matter of fairness; it\u2019s a matter of building a more sustainable and ethical future for college sports.  It recognizes their invaluable contributions, enhances the image of college athletics, and empowers these young individuals for life beyond the court or field.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in championing a more just and equitable future for college sports.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] ESPN. (n.d.).

        "statements": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue against paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits. Sure, it sounds nice at first, but looking closer, there are some serious downsides \u2013 it could really hurt athletic departments and universities financially.  The proponents have suggested a complex system of payouts through trust funds, but this does not address the fundamental issues we will raise.\n\nBefore we get started, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. We're on the same page about focusing on Division I athletes in big-money sports like football and basketball. We should be thinking about how this affects everyone on campus \u2013 athletes, students, academics, and the university's bottom line. It's essential to look at the bigger picture so we can make a smart choice here.\n\nHere\u2019s our case in three points: One, paying athletes could destabilize athletic department finances. Two, doing this creates a huge administrative headache. And three, it opens universities up to major legal and financial risks.\n\nOkay, so first up: how paying athletes could create financial instability. The Wall Street Journal found many college athletic departments are already running on thin ice, money-wise [1].  Giving a chunk of that revenue to athletes, as suggested, would just make things worse. Think about it: if they\u2019re already struggling, how can they pay athletes too?  This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports, impacting a wider range of student-athletes. It could also force reductions in coaching staff and support services, ultimately harming the quality of athletic programs.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the nightmare of actually making this work.  Keepr.io shows how complicated it is to track where all the money goes with profit-sharing [2].  Imagine figuring out each athlete's cut based on how well they play, how the team does, and gender equity rules.  This creates mountains of paperwork, eats up money, and could take away resources from teaching and learning.  This means less money for classrooms, libraries, and research \u2013 resources that benefit all students, not just athletes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the legal and financial liability that profit-sharing creates, our third point. The proponents\u2019 argument relies on classifying student-athletes as employees.  However, this classification triggers significant legal ramifications, particularly regarding worker\u2019s compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation [3].  Given the inherent risks in college sports, the frequency of injuries is high.  Universities would face a substantial increase in worker\u2019s compensation claims.  Imagine you're a university administrator.  How do you budget for the unpredictable costs associated with athlete injuries? This financial burden is further explored in articles like \"College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing\" and \"Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox,\" both published on AthleticDirectorU [4, 5].  These articles highlight the already rising expenses in college athletics and the financial pressures faced by non-profit institutions. Adding worker\u2019s compensation claims to this equation could cripple athletic department budgets.  While some might argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, this is a risky gamble. The unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and injury rates makes this an unstable foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of compensating student-athletes may seem appealing, the practical implications of profit-sharing are fraught with financial, operational, and legal challenges. We urge you to consider the broader impact on the university ecosystem and vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huron Consulting Group. (n.d.).

[Image Descriptor: Photo of Chris] Learn about our Editorial Process College athletes should be paid because they bring a substantial amount of money into their colleges, boost admission rates, put in full-time hours, and do not have the time to get a full-time job on top of their sport. And yet, ridiculously, in many sports, it\u2019s illegal to pay college athletes because it\u2019s considered amateur sports. These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

Many college athletes are admitted into colleges on scholarships and have little extra money to support themselves. Living costs such as rent, food, and textbooks add up so many students find part-time employment to cover these costs.\u00a0 For college athletes, a part-time job really isn\u2019t ",

NCAA revenues rose from about $1.14 billion in the previous fiscal year to $1.28 billion. As usual, the bulk of the NCAA's revenue -- $945 million -- came from media rights and marketing deals tied to championship events. The NCAA's deal with CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery for rights to the men's Division I basketball tournament accounts for about $900 million annually. That means the men's tournament brought in about 69% of the NCAA's revenue. The value of the television deal increases yearly and the statements project an increase to more than $1 billion in 2025. The NCAA's expenses reached $1.17 billion, which includes $669 million distributed to the 363 Division I member schools and another $192 million to stage Division I championship events, the men's basketball National Invitational Tournament and other related programs. More than $100 million was also spent on Division II and III championships and programs, including some distributions back to Division II schools. The NCAA has no direct involvement in the operation of the top tier of Division I football, known as the Bowl Subdivision, and the College Football Playoff that determines its champion and brings in about $470 million annually to the conferences that participate. The NCAA is facing at least five antitrust lawsuits, which challenge rules regulating recruiting, athlete transfers and compensation for athletes. House vs. NCAA was recently class certified and could put the association on the hook for a potential multibillion-dollar payout to former and current college athletes. ",

What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders.

Fair Compensation The issue of fair compensation for student-athletes has been a subject of debate. Ethical questions arise around whether student-athletes should receive financial compensation beyond scholarships and stipends. Balancing the desire for fair compensation with the principle of amateurism, which has long been a core value in college sports, presents a complex ethical challenge. 3.

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

And yet, ridiculously, in many sports, it\u2019s illegal to pay college athletes because it\u2019s considered amateur sports. These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

Athletic departments must strike a delicate balance between generating revenue, supporting student-athletes, and upholding educational values. Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, navigating right and wrong in a high-stakes business becomes complex. Commercialization and Education Critics argue college sports now resemble professional leagues more than extracurricular activities. Multi-million dollar media rights deals, slick marketing, and lavish facilities conflict with academic ideals. Coaches are the top public employees in many states. However, revenues also provide universities with resources benefiting more than just athletes. The mission should remain educating students above profits. Amateurism and Fairness Controversies frequently erupt around NCAA rules restricting payment to athletes. While generating millions for their programs, players receive no direct compensation. However, athletic scholarships have tremendous value. Relaxing amateurism rules too much risks severing college sports from academics. But not sharing revenues more equitably seems profoundly unfair. Nuance is required in rule-making. Student-Athlete Treatment and Welfare With billions of dollars at stake, student-athlete welfare is often forgotten. Their rigorous schedules leave little time for academics or other interests. Pressure to win tempts misconduct like academic fraud. Guaranteeing healthcare, counseling, career support, and developing balanced humans should be the priority. Success on the field can\u2019t eclipse student wellbeing.

Each of these revenue streams plays a unique role in the financial tapestry of college sports.

Analysis of Expenses in College Sports The financial landscape of college sports is a complex interplay of revenue and expenses.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

At the heart of this economic ecosystem are the athletic departments of universities, which rely on a combination of traditional and modern income sources to fund their operations and support their student-athletes. Each of these revenue streams plays a unique role in the financial tapestry of college sports. Together, they create a robust and dynamic economy that not only supports the athletic endeavors of student-athletes but also enhances the overall reputation and appeal of the universities they represent. As the landscape of college sports continues to evolve, the balance and importance of these revenue streams may shift, but their collective impact remains undeniable. Analysis of Expenses in College Sports The financial landscape of college sports is a complex interplay of revenue and expenses. While the income streams are critical for the sustenance and growth, the expenditures are equally significant, dictating the operational efficiency and long-term viability of athletic programs. In this section, we delve into the various costs associated with college sports, examining the balance between these expenses and the revenue generated, and highlighting potential financial challenges or disparities. Coaching Salaries: The Price of Expertise One of the most significant expenses for any college sports program is the compensation for coaching staff. Head coaches, especially in high-profile sports like football and basketball, can command salaries that rival those of professional coaches. These salaries are often justified by the revenue potential of successful teams, but they also contribute to a widening gap between the highest and lowest-paid coaches within a university or across different institutions.

Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue. Technological Advancements: Virtual Experiences The pandemic forced many organizations to innovate, and college athletics have been no exception. With limited in-person attendance, institutions leveraged technology to provide virtual experiences, ranging from virtual stadium tours to interactive online fan zones.

And while individual sports programs -- even in Division I schools -- don't necessarily turn a profit, the many other benefits to colleges have far-reaching implications for students, faculty and community. Athletics programs drive enrollment and heighten college profiles, often resulting in financial windfalls for the institutions that happen far away from fields and arenas. Direct Profits For select colleges, athletics programs bring in big money. Media rights, ticket sales, branding and direct program donations total millions of dollars. A 2008 analysis conducted by ESPN noted just how profitable programs are to some schools. The University of Alabama athletic department raked in nearly $124 million, thanks in large part to the storied reputation of its Crimson Tide football program. The school saw revenue of more than $13 million from media and branding rights, almost $30 million in donations and $28 million in ticket sales.

While some argue that athletic departments face financial strain (as reported by the Wall Street Journal and AthleticDirectorU), failing to compensate the primary revenue generators is unjust.  Addressing potential financial difficulties within athletic departments should involve finding sustainable solutions rather than denying athletes a share of the wealth they create.  Furthermore, scholarships, while valuable, do not fully address the financial realities faced by many student-athletes, especially those from low-income backgrounds.  Compensating athletes recognizes their economic contribution and provides much-needed financial security, allowing them to focus on their academic and athletic pursuits. This addresses the counter-argument by demonstrating that sharing revenue with the primary drivers of the industry makes both ethical and economic sense.",

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

In this article, Jared Kamrass\u00a0 delve into the ethical dimensions of college sports, examining the balance between profit-seeking endeavors and upholding core values in education. 1. Student-Athlete Welfare One of the primary ethical considerations in college sports is the well-being of student-athletes. Balancing rigorous training schedules, academic responsibilities, and competitive pressures can take a toll on the physical and mental health of student-athletes. Institutions must prioritize the health and safety of their athletes, providing proper medical care, mental health support, and reasonable workloads. 2. Fair Compensation The issue of fair compensation for student-athletes has been a subject of debate. Ethical questions arise around whether student-athletes should receive financial compensation beyond scholarships and stipends. Balancing the desire for fair compensation with the principle of amateurism, which has long been a core value in college sports, presents a complex ethical challenge. 3. Academic Integrity Upholding academic integrity is essential in college sports. Ethical concerns arise when student-athletes are steered towards easy or less rigorous courses to accommodate their athletic commitments. Institutions must maintain academic standards and ensure that athletes receive a genuine education. 4. Compliance with Regulations The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sets rules and regulations governing college sports. Ethical considerations include ensuring institutions and athletes adhere to these rules. Violations, such as recruiting infractions an",

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders.

Fair Compensation The issue of fair compensation for student-athletes has been a subject of debate. Ethical questions arise around whether student-athletes should receive financial compensation beyond scholarships and stipends. Balancing the desire for fair compensation with the principle of amateurism, which has long been a core value in college sports, presents a complex ethical challenge. 3. Academic Integrity Upholding academic integrity is essential in college sports.

Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

Athletic departments must strike a delicate balance between generating revenue, supporting student-athletes, and upholding educational values. Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, navigating right and wrong in a high-stakes business becomes complex. Commercialization and Education Critics argue college sports now resemble professional leagues more than extracurricular activities. Multi-million dollar media rights deals, slick marketing, and lavish facilities conflict with academic ideals. Coaches are the top public employees in many states. However, revenues also provide universities with resources benefiting more than just athletes. The mission should remain educating students above profits. Amateurism and Fairness Controversies frequently erupt around NCAA rules restricting payment to athletes. While generating millions for their programs, players receive no direct compensation. However, athletic scholarships have tremendous value. Relaxing amateurism rules too much risks severing college sports from academics. But not sharing revenues more equitably seems profoundly unfair. Nuance is required in rule-making. Student-Athlete Treatment and Welfare With billions of dollars at stake, student-athlete welfare is often forgotten. Their rigorous schedules leave little time for academics or other interests. Pressure to win tempts misconduct like academic fraud. Guaranteeing healthcare, counseling, career support, and developing balanced humans should be the priority. Success on the field can\u2019t eclipse student wellbeing. Integrity and Values Winning and revenue generation cannot outweigh integrit",

These diverse revenue sources enable schools to enhance their athletic programs with state-of-the-art facilities, attract top coaching talent, and increase their visibility. However, the distribution of these funds often raises questions about the balance between athletics and academics. \r High-profile sports like football and basketball can generate millions of dollars. For instance, the Southeastern Conference (SEC) schools boast massive stadiums, often filled, contributing significantly to their revenue. Coaches in these leagues also command high salaries, with averages reaching $4.1 million annually. \r Despite this, many argue that the financial benefits of athletics do not always translate to academic advantages, with most schools needing to subsidize their sports programs through student fees and other funds.

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports. Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue. Technological Advancements: Virtual Experiences The pandemic forced many organizations to innovate, and college athletics have been no exception. With limited in-person attendance, institutions leveraged technology to provide virtual experiences, ranging from virtual stadium tours to interactive online fan zones.

Independent, third-party management coupled with a public formula ensures both responsible fund handling and equitable, Title IX-compliant distribution, addressing ethical concerns highlighted by Jared Kamrass and ensuring fairness for all athletes while safeguarding the integrity of college sports. This model incentivizes academic focus and responsible financial planning, mitigating concerns about athletes' financial immaturity while fairly compensating their athletic contributions.

        "statements": "Look, everyone, let's be real: they're talking about financial disaster and administrative mess, but their points just don't stick. They\u2019re missing out on what revenue sharing can do \u2013 it\u2019s meant to help everyone involved, right?\n\nThey claim paying athletes will bankrupt athletic departments, citing the Wall Street Journal.  But they\u2019re missing something big: Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances [1].  Get great players, get more wins, more fans, and more money \u2013 growing revenue, not losing it.  Think about it.  A winning team brings in more money. A good athletic program makes the school look better, you know, attracting more students and boosting donations. It's a win-win.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about this so-called administrative nightmare of theirs. They claim tracking revenue and distributing profits will be overly complex, citing Keepr.io.  But they\u2019re ignoring models that already work, you know. Studies show systems like ours, based on percentages, are manageable and efficient [2, 3].  Imagine a system capped at a reasonable amount, say \\$22 million \u2013 this simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.  Pro sports do revenue sharing just fine; so can colleges, right? They've got this whole thing backward.  This system isn't about creating more work; it's about bringing fairness and transparency to how these billions of dollars are distributed.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not calling student-athletes employees.  So, their worker\u2019s comp argument, from \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" doesn\u2019t apply. Our model uses a trust fund, with payouts after graduation or leaving the program. This keeps things amateur, avoiding the legal and financial risks they mentioned. Picture a transparent system with a clear formula, you know, watched by someone independent. This is responsible money management and fair distribution, not a free-for-all on lawsuits.  This directly addresses ethical concerns about fair compensation and ensures compliance with Title IX.  \n\nRemember, they brought up the financial struggles of some athletic departments.  Let's consider this: ESPN reported that the NCAA made nearly $1.3 billion in 2022-23, mostly from men\u2019s basketball [4].  Student-athletes are the heart and soul of this massive industry.  Their talent and dedication draw the fans and generate this revenue.  Imagine being a student-athlete, pouring your heart into your sport, generating millions for your school, but struggling financially. Paying them isn\u2019t about creating a burden; it\u2019s about acknowledging their contributions and sharing the wealth they help create. Our system addresses their concerns by tying compensation directly to the revenue generated.  It's a fair and responsible approach.\n\nFinally, they completely miss the mark on the bigger picture. This isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about fairness, recognizing the immense contributions of these young athletes. Think about the sacrifices they make, balancing rigorous training schedules with academic demands.  Delayed payouts through a trust fund encourage responsible financial planning and academic focus.  This is about empowering student-athletes for life after college, providing a financial safety net as they transition to their next chapter. This is about fairness, opportunity, and investing in the future of these young people who dedicate so much to their universities.\n\nIn conclusion, revenue sharing isn\u2019t a threat to college sports; it\u2019s an opportunity to build a better future. A future that\u2019s fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in creating a more just and sustainable model for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Seattle PI. (n.d.).

        "statements": "They keep saying it's a win-win, but they're ignoring some serious money problems. They say sharing money helps schools, and they mention Seattle PI. But let's be real here.  EAB reports show many athletic departments are already in trouble, lots of Power Five schools are losing money [1].  Paying athletes will probably make things worse, maybe even leading to cuts and instability.  They're optimistic about more money, but winning isn't a sure thing, and even good programs can have money problems.  Imagine your team has a bad season. Suddenly, that extra money's gone, leaving the athletic department in more trouble.\n\nThey say their system is simple, easy to run, pointing to pro sports. But here's the difference: pro sports make money, universities are for education.  Keepr.io shows how complex profit-sharing is, needing complex accounting and legal stuff [2].  Imagine tracking every athlete, team results, gender equity, and following all the rules. This extra work will take money from important things like academics and research.  They also forget about college sports rules, which makes their \"simple\" system more complex.  Comparing it to pro sports hides the administrative mess this would actually be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about their trust fund idea, their answer to workers' compensation.  They say it keeps athletes amateur.  But Bloomberg Law shows us legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening, even without employee status [3].  A $2.75 billion settlement, anyone?  This suggests that the legal risks they dismiss are very real, regardless of how they structure the payments.  A trust fund doesn't magically erase the potential for lawsuits.  So, their claim that this avoids legal issues just doesn't hold up. Imagine you're a university facing a lawsuit from a former athlete, trust fund or not.  The legal costs and potential damage to the university's reputation are significant, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis brings me back to the financial instability of athletic departments. We\u2019ve established that many athletic departments are already struggling. The Wall Street Journal, citing Huron Consulting, found that less than half of Power Five athletic departments, the wealthiest in college sports, have adequate financial reserves [4].  Adding a substantial new expense like athlete compensation would likely exacerbate existing financial difficulties. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and staff, as highlighted by Kutak Rock\u2019s analysis, impacting opportunities for students and the university community [5].  Think about it, if departments are already struggling, how can they afford to share revenue?  The supposed revenue boost from winning is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t guarantee financial stability.  In fact, EAB points out the pressure to win can lead to overspending and even greater financial risk [1].\n\nThey talk about fairness and recognizing contributions.  Yes, student-athletes work hard. But universities already invest in them through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  The current system, though imperfect, provides substantial support. Profit-sharing adds an immense financial burden that threatens the stability of entire athletic programs, impacting not just athletes but the broader university community.  Imagine your school having to cut academic programs or increase tuition to cover the costs of profit-sharing. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, their arguments for profit-sharing fail to address the complex realities of college athletics.  The financial risks, administrative burdens, and legal vulnerabilities are simply too great to ignore.  We urge you to vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

Financial pressures across higher education are forcing institutional leaders to take actions that had previously been considered untenable. Digging deeper into the revenue makeup and expense drivers of both autonomous and midmajor athletic departments highlights how difficult stabilizing bottom lines will be in the coming years and adds insight into actions over the past year by institutions. The economics of college athletics has been an area of growing significance \u2014 and concern \u2014 at many institutions, where the business model and mission are often distinct from other university operations. One year after March Madness was cancelled, institutional leaders at over 89 colleges and universities have cut over 290 athletic programs in response to the financial pressures of the pandemic. And while the flurry of activity may have subsided for the time being, leaders remain at a crossroads and need to fully understand the economics of college athletics and how the pandemic may reshape them to move forward. Under many resource allocation models, athletic departments are treated as auxiliary units within the university. As such, they are expected to break even financially and rely on...

Moreover, as pointed out by North Carolina A&T State University's Aggie Hub on cost-sharing, the administrative burden includes extensive documentation and resource allocation, further straining university operations.  While some might argue that existing university accounting systems are robust enough, the unique nature of profit-sharing, with its variable payouts and potentially large number of recipients, presents a new level of complexity.

Successfully navigating these obstacles is essential to fully reap the benefits of profit sharing. Below, we\u2019ll explore the top four challenges to profit sharing and offer practical solutions to ensure your strategy thrives. 1. Navigating Complexity in Setup and Management Challenge: Setting up a profit-sharing plan involves complex financial calculations, legal compliance, and ongoing administrative management. These tasks can be particularly overwhelming for smaller businesses that lack dedicated HR or financial teams. Solution: Investing in a professional management tool can simplify the setup and administration of your profit-sharing plan. Software like Keepr or similar platforms can automate many of the processes involved, from calculating contributions to managing compliance issues. These tools reduce the administrative burden, allowing you to focus on core business operations while ensuring your profit-sharing plan remains effective and compliant. Furthermore, working with a financial advisor or a consultant with expertise in profit-sharing can help tailor the plan to your company\u2019s specific needs, ensuring that it aligns with both your financial goals and legal obligations. 2. Addressing Potential Inequities Challenge: If not designed carefully, profit-sharing plans can lead to perceptions of unfairness among employees. This issue often arises when employees feel that the distribution formula does not accurately reflect their contributions or efforts, leading to dissatisfaction and potential disengagement.

However, this classification triggers a cascade of legal and financial ramifications, particularly concerning worker's compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers\", employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation.  Given the high rate of injuries in college sports, universities would face a substantial increase in claims, impacting their budgets as highlighted in discussions of rising athletic expenses by sources like AthleticDirectorU.  This financial strain could necessitate cuts in other essential areas, such as academic programs, scholarships, and research initiatives. Some argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, but this is uncertain given the unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and the volume of worker's compensation claims.  Furthermore, the current NCAA framework, while not without flaws, provides a level of protection against such liabilities, which would disappear with employee status.

You can make the case that six of those expense categories are directly tied to competition (such as financial guarantees, team travel and sports equipment, uniforms and supplies), four relate to money spent on coaches (salaries, benefits and bonuses paid by the university, those that are paid by a third party, severance payments, and bonuses from bowl games), three categories pertain directly to athletes (athletic student aid, meals, and medical expenses and insurance) and two are for support staff.

                    "raw_content": "Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox In 2019, Dr. Kevin Blue, then-University of California-Davis Athletic Director, penned a piece for ADU called the Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox. In his article, Blue described the structural challenges surrounding the growing expenses in big-time college athletics. He noted three economic components that inform athletic directors\u2019 financial decisions: A non-profit organizational structure, zero-sum competition, and accelerating revenue. First, Blue highlighted the non-profit organizational structure of college sport. Athletic departments don\u2019t have owners looking for a return on investment, and thus, sport leaders are not inclined to operate with the goal of turning a profit. With this, economic decisions are informed based on college sport missions, supposedly things like athlete development, gender equity, academic primacy, and long-term sustainability. Financial decisions are also\u2014arguably predominantly\u2014based on winning. Thus, because college sport is a non-profit, when revenues continue to rise, as we\u2019re seeing right now, expenses simultaneously increase in order to achieve the mission(s). Second, Blue discussed college sports\u2019 zero-sum environment: One team or program must win, and thus, another must lose. The competitive and zero-sum design of intercollegiate athletics creates what Blue called \u201can insatiable desire for an athletics program to make investments that drive success in the competitive part of its mission.\u201d The drive to win thus increases departmental expenses. Third, Blue described the trend of accelerating revenues in college athletics, something other non-profit fields do not similarly experience. Once again, since the non-profit mission of college athletics is not to create return on investment or generate surplus revenue, as revenue accelerates, so too do expenses. He concluded these three factors pressurize expenses, increasing departmental spending. And because of the design of ",

However, this classification triggers a cascade of legal and financial ramifications, particularly concerning worker's compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers\", employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation.  Given the high rate of injuries in college sports, universities would face a substantial increase in claims, impacting their budgets as highlighted in discussions of rising athletic expenses by sources like AthleticDirectorU.  This financial strain could necessitate cuts in other essential areas, such as academic programs, scholarships, and research initiatives. Some argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, but this is uncertain given the unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and the volume of worker's compensation claims.  Furthermore, the current NCAA framework, while not without flaws, provides a level of protection against such liabilities, which would disappear with employee status. Therefore, while student-athlete compensation is a complex issue, profit-sharing introduces significant financial and legal risks that could negatively affect the broader university mission.\n\n"

        "statements": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue against paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits. Sure, it sounds nice at first, but looking closer, there are some serious downsides \u2013 it could really hurt athletic departments and universities financially.  The proponents have suggested a complex system of payouts through trust funds, but this does not address the fundamental issues we will raise.\n\nBefore we get started, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. We're on the same page about focusing on Division I athletes in big-money sports like football and basketball. We should be thinking about how this affects everyone on campus \u2013 athletes, students, academics, and the university's bottom line. It's essential to look at the bigger picture so we can make a smart choice here.\n\nHere\u2019s our case in three points: One, paying athletes could destabilize athletic department finances. Two, doing this creates a huge administrative headache. And three, it opens universities up to major legal and financial risks.\n\nOkay, so first up: how paying athletes could create financial instability. The Wall Street Journal found many college athletic departments are already running on thin ice, money-wise [1].  Giving a chunk of that revenue to athletes, as suggested, would just make things worse. Think about it: if they\u2019re already struggling, how can they pay athletes too?  This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports, impacting a wider range of student-athletes. It could also force reductions in coaching staff and support services, ultimately harming the quality of athletic programs.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the nightmare of actually making this work.  Keepr.io shows how complicated it is to track where all the money goes with profit-sharing [2].  Imagine figuring out each athlete's cut based on how well they play, how the team does, and gender equity rules.  This creates mountains of paperwork, eats up money, and could take away resources from teaching and learning.  This means less money for classrooms, libraries, and research \u2013 resources that benefit all students, not just athletes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the legal and financial liability that profit-sharing creates, our third point. The proponents\u2019 argument relies on classifying student-athletes as employees.  However, this classification triggers significant legal ramifications, particularly regarding worker\u2019s compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation [3].  Given the inherent risks in college sports, the frequency of injuries is high.  Universities would face a substantial increase in worker\u2019s compensation claims.  Imagine you're a university administrator.  How do you budget for the unpredictable costs associated with athlete injuries? This financial burden is further explored in articles like \"College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing\" and \"Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox,\" both published on AthleticDirectorU [4, 5].  These articles highlight the already rising expenses in college athletics and the financial pressures faced by non-profit institutions. Adding worker\u2019s compensation claims to this equation could cripple athletic department budgets.  While some might argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, this is a risky gamble. The unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and injury rates makes this an unstable foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of compensating student-athletes may seem appealing, the practical implications of profit-sharing are fraught with financial, operational, and legal challenges. We urge you to consider the broader impact on the university ecosystem and vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huron Consulting Group. (n.d.).

They\u2019re missing out on what revenue sharing can do \u2013 it\u2019s meant to help everyone involved, right?\n\nThey claim paying athletes will bankrupt athletic departments, citing the Wall Street Journal.  But they\u2019re missing something big: Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances [1].  Get great players, get more wins, more fans, and more money \u2013 growing revenue, not losing it.  Think about it.  A winning team brings in more money. A good athletic program makes the school look better, you know, attracting more students and boosting donations. It's a win-win.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about this so-called administrative nightmare of theirs. They claim tracking revenue and distributing profits will be overly complex, citing Keepr.io.  But they\u2019re ignoring models that already work, you know. Studies show systems like ours, based on percentages, are manageable and efficient [2, 3].  Imagine a system capped at a reasonable amount, say \\$22 million \u2013 this simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.  Pro sports do revenue sharing just fine; so can colleges, right? They've got this whole thing backward.  This system isn't about creating more work; it's about bringing fairness and transparency to how these billions of dollars are distributed.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not calling student-athletes employees.  So, their worker\u2019s comp argument, from \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" doesn\u2019t apply. Our model uses a trust fund, with payouts after graduation or leaving the program. This keeps things amateur, avoiding the legal and financial risks they mentioned. Picture a transparent system with a clear formula, you know, watched by someone independent. This is responsible money management and fair distribution, not a free-for-all on lawsuits.  This directly addresses ethical concerns about fair compensation and ensures compliance with Title IX.  \n\nRemember, they brought up the financial struggles of some athletic departments.  Let's consider this: ESPN reported that the NCAA made nearly $1.3 billion in 2022-23, mostly from men\u2019s basketball [4].  Student-athletes are the heart and soul of this massive industry.  Their talent and dedication draw the fans and generate this revenue.  Imagine being a student-athlete, pouring your heart into your sport, generating millions for your school, but struggling financially. Paying them isn\u2019t about creating a burden; it\u2019s about acknowledging their contributions and sharing the wealth they help create. Our system addresses their concerns by tying compensation directly to the revenue generated.  It's a fair and responsible approach.\n\nFinally, they completely miss the mark on the bigger picture. This isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about fairness, recognizing the immense contributions of these young athletes. Think about the sacrifices they make, balancing rigorous training schedules with academic demands.  Delayed payouts through a trust fund encourage responsible financial planning and academic focus.  This is about empowering student-athletes for life after college, providing a financial safety net as they transition to their next chapter. This is about fairness, opportunity, and investing in the future of these young people who dedicate so much to their universities.\n\nIn conclusion, revenue sharing isn\u2019t a threat to college sports; it\u2019s an opportunity to build a better future. A future that\u2019s fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in creating a more just and sustainable model for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Seattle PI. (n.d.).

The USA Today (usatoday.com) article details ongoing litigation targeting NCAA compensation rules and seeking damages for athletes in revenue-generating sports, indicating that legal risks persist even outside formal employment.  The trust fund model, while structuring payouts for after graduation, does not inherently prevent claims of unpaid value or exploitation during athletes' playing careers.  Therefore, it's likely that universities implementing such a model could still face legal battles and financial repercussions, challenging the claim's core assumption that non-employee status provides full legal and financial protection.  A counterargument might be that the trust fund model is fundamentally different, but this difference remains untested in the courts and ignores the trend of increasing legal pressure to recognize the economic realities of college athletics.",

Financial pressures across higher education are forcing institutional leaders to take actions that had previously been considered untenable. Digging deeper into the revenue makeup and expense drivers of both autonomous and midmajor athletic departments highlights how difficult stabilizing bottom lines will be in the coming years and adds insight into actions over the past year by institutions. The economics of college athletics has been an area of growing significance \u2014 and concern \u2014 at many institutions, where the business model and mission are often distinct from other university operations. One year after March Madness was cancelled, institutional leaders at over 89 colleges and universities have cut over 290 athletic programs in response to the financial pressures of the pandemic. And while the flurry of activity may have subsided for the time being, leaders remain at a crossroads and need to fully understand the economics of college athletics and how the pandemic may reshape them to move forward. Under many resource allocation models, athletic departments are treated as auxiliary units within the university. As such, they are expected to break even financially and rely on...

The Student Athlete Advisors also highlight this risk (13_26), adding that mid-major programs will struggle the most.  Furthermore, the complexity of defining \"revenue\" and allocating funds, as detailed in the Sports Litigation Alert article (13_19), adds administrative burden that the claim ignores.  While proponents might argue that professional sports use revenue sharing, the substantial difference in organizational structure and resource availability makes that comparison flawed. College athletic departments are often already operating with tight budgets, and the added complexity of implementing and managing a revenue-sharing system could create a significant administrative burden, potentially leading to unintended consequences that outweigh the intended benefits.",

The natural, usually first, and perhaps most common answer is that revenue is all income generated. \u00a0But it may not be that simple, and there would need to be some mechanism to verify the revenue reported. California\u2019s proposed College Athlete Protection (CAP) Act (currently not in effect) proposed using annual reports institutions must make under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) for both identifying a revenue number and ensuring transparency. The EADA requires institutions to submit an annual report to the federal government about varsity intercollegiate athletics programs and the financial resources and personnel dedicated to those teams.\u00a0 This reporting requirement arose out of concerns that there was insufficient transparency and inequitable spending in college sports well after Title IX was passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The January 2023 version of the CAP Act defined revenue as the \u201cannual intercollegiate athletics revenue as calculated and ",

NCAA settlement represents a seismic shift in the landscape of college athletics. In this article, I appreciate how the author navigates the complex implications of the settlement, shedding light on the winners and losers, even before the final details were solidified in early August. This analysis not only highlights the transformative impact of the $2.8 billion NIL backpay and the introduction of a revenue-sharing framework for athletes but also underscores the far-reaching consequences for non-revenue sports, which might be the biggest losers in this new reality. As athletic departments, particularly those in mid-major programs, grapple with the financial strain of the settlement, these programs face potential cuts, threatening the future of many sports that have long been part of the college athletics fabric.

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball. The 65 universities analyzed are members of the Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern, and Atlantic Coast conferences. More detailed budget breakdowns were available from the 46 public institutions in the sample, but not from sports powerhouse private universities such as Notre Dame and Stanford",

                "argument": "The Huron Consulting Group, a leading expert in higher education finance, reports that many athletic departments operate with precarious budgets. Their analysis, cited by the Wall Street Journal, reveals that less than half of Power Five athletic departments and even fewer Group of Five departments have built financial reserves.  This finding indicates a systemic vulnerability within college athletics finances. Implementing a profit-sharing model, while potentially beneficial to student-athletes in revenue-generating sports, would likely exacerbate the financial strain on athletic departments. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue-generating sports, as highlighted by Kutak Rock's analysis of the NCAA antitrust settlement, potentially diminishing opportunities for student-athletes and negatively impacting program diversity. While some argue that increased revenue from successful athletic programs could offset these costs, the existing financial instability, coupled with the added expense of profit-sharing, suggests that many departments would struggle to maintain current program offerings, let alone expand them. This financial strain could also lead to increased reliance on institutional subsidies, further diverting resources from other crucial areas of the university.",

Successfully navigating these obstacles is essential to fully reap the benefits of profit sharing. Below, we\u2019ll explore the top four challenges to profit sharing and offer practical solutions to ensure your strategy thrives. 1. Navigating Complexity in Setup and Management Challenge: Setting up a profit-sharing plan involves complex financial calculations, legal compliance, and ongoing administrative management. These tasks can be particularly overwhelming for smaller businesses that lack dedicated HR or financial teams. Solution: Investing in a professional management tool can simplify the setup and administration of your profit-sharing plan. Software like Keepr or similar platforms can automate many of the processes involved, from calculating contributions to managing compliance issues. These tools reduce the administrative burden, allowing you to focus on core business operations while ensuring your profit-sharing plan remains effective and compliant. Furthermore, working with a financial advisor or a consultant with expertise in profit-sharing can help tailor the plan to your company\u2019s specific needs, ensuring that it aligns with both your financial goals and legal obligations. 2. Addressing Potential Inequities Challenge: If not designed carefully, profit-sharing plans can lead to perceptions of unfairness among employees. This issue often arises when employees feel that the distribution formula does not accurately reflect their contributions or efforts, leading to dissatisfaction and potential disengagement. Solution: To mitigate this challenge, it\u2019s crucial to design a transparent and objective distribution formula. The formu",

A recent NCAA settlement, which allows for revenue sharing of up to $20 million per year with athletes starting in 2025, does not address Title IX compliance specifics, leaving institutions to navigate these decisions independently. Title IX mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must ensure gender equity in sport, which includes equal opportunities, benefits, and financial aid based on sex.\u00a0 Schools must continue to offer equal athletic opportunities without discriminating in the provision of financial aid, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for OCR, wrote in a statement to ESPN. She also emphasized that the principles of Title IX remain unchanged in the new environment, which allows student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness.\u00a0 OCR did not specify whether the new revenue share would be categorized as financial aid, which traditionally requires proportional distribution based on roster spots. This ambiguity forces athletic departments to make potentially contentious decisions such as distributing revenue equally, which could undermine football recruiting competitiveness, or risk legal challenges by favoring male athletes. The lack of federal guidance adds complexity, as schools must avoid gender disparities in benefits and opportunities, regardless of the funding source. Universities are exploring different models, including channeling funds through third parties for endorsement deals, but must ensure these practices comply with Title IX requirements.\u00a0 Schools are awaiting clarity on these regulations, which might only come through future legal rulings or potential legislative action.

Simultaneously, declining operating margins reported by HigherEdDive further strain university budgets, making the added costs of profit-sharing difficult to absorb.

A recent NCAA settlement, which allows for revenue sharing of up to $20 million per year with athletes starting in 2025, does not address Title IX compliance specifics, leaving institutions to navigate these decisions independently. Title IX mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must ensure gender equity in sport, which includes equal opportunities, benefits, and financial aid based on sex.\u00a0 Schools must continue to offer equal athletic opportunities without discriminating in the provision of financial aid, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for OCR, wrote in a statement to ESPN. She also emphasized that the principles of Title IX remain unchanged in the new environment, which allows student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness.\u00a0 OCR did not specify whether the new revenue share would be categorized as financial aid, which traditionally requires proportional distribution based on roster spots. This ambiguity forces athletic departments to make potentially contentious decisions such as distributing revenue equally, which could undermine football recruiting competitiveness, or risk legal challenges by favoring male athletes. The lack of federal guidance adds complexity, as schools must avoid gender disparities in benefits and opportunities, regardless of the funding source. Universities are exploring different models, including channeling funds through third parties for endorsement deals, but must ensure these practices comply with Title IX requirements.\u00a0 Schools are awaiting clarity on these regulations, which might only come through future legal rulings or potential legislative action.

Successfully navigating these obstacles is essential to fully reap the benefits of profit sharing. Below, we\u2019ll explore the top four challenges to profit sharing and offer practical solutions to ensure your strategy thrives. 1. Navigating Complexity in Setup and Management Challenge: Setting up a profit-sharing plan involves complex financial calculations, legal compliance, and ongoing administrative management. These tasks can be particularly overwhelming for smaller businesses that lack dedicated HR or financial teams. Solution: Investing in a professional management tool can simplify the setup and administration of your profit-sharing plan. Software like Keepr or similar platforms can automate many of the processes involved, from calculating contributions to managing compliance issues. These tools reduce the administrative burden, allowing you to focus on core business operations while ensuring your profit-sharing plan remains effective and compliant. Furthermore, working with a financial advisor or a consultant with expertise in profit-sharing can help tailor the plan to your company\u2019s specific needs, ensuring that it aligns with both your financial goals and legal obligations. 2. Addressing Potential Inequities Challenge: If not designed carefully, profit-sharing plans can lead to perceptions of unfairness among employees. This issue often arises when employees feel that the distribution formula does not accurately reflect their contributions or efforts, leading to dissatisfaction and potential disengagement.

Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week. The NCAA Board of Governors also must approve the deal. If the bid to move the fourth case to California is rejected, it could continue in Colorado.

The NCAA's amateurism model, despite not classifying athletes as employees, resulted in a substantial $2.75 billion antitrust settlement, as reported by Bloomberg Law (news.bloomberglaw.com), a reputable legal news source.  This illustrates the vulnerability of compensation structures, regardless of employment classification, to legal challenges and financial liabilities.  The USA Today (usatoday.com) article details ongoing litigation targeting NCAA compensation rules and seeking damages for athletes in revenue-generating sports, indicating that legal risks persist even outside formal employment.  The trust fund model, while structuring payouts for after graduation, does not inherently prevent claims of unpaid value or exploitation during athletes' playing careers.  Therefore, it's likely that universities implementing such a model could still face legal battles and financial repercussions, challenging the claim's core assumption that non-employee status provides full legal and financial protection.  A counterargument might be that the trust fund model is fundamentally different, but this difference remains untested in the courts and ignores the trend of increasing legal pressure to recognize the economic realities of college athletics.",

The NCAA and its Power Five conferences agreed to pay $2.75 billion in damages to college athletes over a 10-year period in a deal that seeks to resolve three pending antitrust lawsuits. The agreement also eliminates NCAA and conference rules that prohibit direct payments from schools to athletes, and allows direct revenue sharing through new payments and benefits, according to a statement from Hagens Berman and Winston & Strawn LLP, the firms representing athlete plaintiffs. The proposed agreement is meant to stave off future antitrust litigation, but player advocates and attorneys say its terms could open the association, conferences, and schools up to more claims that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unlawfully misclassifying the athletes as students instead of employees under federal labor and wage and hour law. The settlement will still need to be approved by the judge presiding over the three cases. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a seismic shift but is this the end of the road?

That fourth case is set for a hearing Thursday before U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Colorado who is considering the association\u2019s and conferences\u2019 request to have the matter transferred to California, where it likely would be folded into the cases moving toward settlement. Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week. The NCAA Board of Governors also must approve the deal. If the bid to move the fourth case to California is rejected, it could continue in Colorado. If that happens, the NCAA, the conferences and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in the cases seemingly headed toward settlement may have to deal with lawyers who wrote in a filing Tuesday evening that \u201cit seems likely\u201d that one of their plaintiffs \u201cwill opt out of any such settlement t",

Financial pressures across higher education are forcing institutional leaders to take actions that had previously been considered untenable. Digging deeper into the revenue makeup and expense drivers of both autonomous and midmajor athletic departments highlights how difficult stabilizing bottom lines will be in the coming years and adds insight into actions over the past year by institutions. The economics of college athletics has been an area of growing significance \u2014 and concern \u2014 at many institutions, where the business model and mission are often distinct from other university operations. One year after March Madness was cancelled, institutional leaders at over 89 colleges and universities have cut over 290 athletic programs in response to the financial pressures of the pandemic. And while the flurry of activity may have subsided for the time being, leaders remain at a crossroads and need to fully understand the economics of college athletics and how the pandemic may reshape them to move forward. Under many resource allocation models, athletic departments are treated as auxiliary units within the university. As such, they are expected to break even financially and rely on...

California\u2019s proposed College Athlete Protection (CAP) Act (currently not in effect) proposed using annual reports institutions must make under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) for both identifying a revenue number and ensuring transparency. The EADA requires institutions to submit an annual report to the federal government about varsity intercollegiate athletics programs and the financial resources and personnel dedicated to those teams.\u00a0 This reporting requirement arose out of concerns that there was insufficient transparency and inequitable spending in college sports well after Title IX was passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The January 2023 version of the CAP Act defined revenue as the \u201cannual intercollegiate athletics revenue as calculated and ",

NCAA settlement represents a seismic shift in the landscape of college athletics. In this article, I appreciate how the author navigates the complex implications of the settlement, shedding light on the winners and losers, even before the final details were solidified in early August. This analysis not only highlights the transformative impact of the $2.8 billion NIL backpay and the introduction of a revenue-sharing framework for athletes but also underscores the far-reaching consequences for non-revenue sports, which might be the biggest losers in this new reality. As athletic departments, particularly those in mid-major programs, grapple with the financial strain of the settlement, these programs face potential cuts, threatening the future of many sports that have long been part of the college athletics fabric.

Financial pressures across higher education are forcing institutional leaders to take actions that had previously been considered untenable. Digging deeper into the revenue makeup and expense drivers of both autonomous and midmajor athletic departments highlights how difficult stabilizing bottom lines will be in the coming years and adds insight into actions over the past year by institutions. The economics of college athletics has been an area of growing significance \u2014 and concern \u2014 at many institutions, where the business model and mission are often distinct from other university operations. One year after March Madness was cancelled, institutional leaders at over 89 colleges and universities have cut over 290 athletic programs in response to the financial pressures of the pandemic. And while the flurry of activity may have subsided for the time being, leaders remain at a crossroads and need to fully understand the economics of college athletics and how the pandemic may reshape them to move forward. Under many resource allocation models, athletic departments are treated as auxiliary units within the university. As such, they are expected to break even financially and rely on...

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball. The 65 universities analyzed are members of the Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern, and Atlantic Coast conferences. More detailed budget breakdowns were available from the 46 public institutions in the sample, but not from sports powerhouse private universities such as Notre Dame and Stanford",

Their analysis, cited by the Wall Street Journal, reveals that less than half of Power Five athletic departments and even fewer Group of Five departments have built financial reserves.  This finding indicates a systemic vulnerability within college athletics finances. Implementing a profit-sharing model, while potentially beneficial to student-athletes in revenue-generating sports, would likely exacerbate the financial strain on athletic departments. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue-generating sports, as highlighted by Kutak Rock's analysis of the NCAA antitrust settlement, potentially diminishing opportunities for student-athletes and negatively impacting program diversity. While some argue that increased revenue from successful athletic programs could offset these costs, the existing financial instability, coupled with the added expense of profit-sharing, suggests that many departments would struggle to maintain current program offerings, let alone expand them. This financial strain could also lead to increased reliance on institutional subsidies, further diverting resources from other crucial areas of the university.",

Software like Keepr or similar platforms can automate many of the processes involved, from calculating contributions to managing compliance issues. These tools reduce the administrative burden, allowing you to focus on core business operations while ensuring your profit-sharing plan remains effective and compliant. Furthermore, working with a financial advisor or a consultant with expertise in profit-sharing can help tailor the plan to your company\u2019s specific needs, ensuring that it aligns with both your financial goals and legal obligations. 2. Addressing Potential Inequities Challenge: If not designed carefully, profit-sharing plans can lead to perceptions of unfairness among employees.

Meanwhile, median tuition discount rates at private colleges rose by more than 5 percentage points, to 44.4%, in that period, putting pressure on college revenues.\u00a0 From 2019 through the second quarter of 2024, the ratings agency issued 126 credit downgrades for the higher ed sector, compared to 62 upgrades, per the report.

Bloomberg Law (news.bloomberglaw.com) reports on a $2.75 billion settlement addressing athlete compensation, indicating legal challenges persist despite the NCAA's amateurism model.  This demonstrates ongoing legal vulnerability regarding athlete compensation, regardless of employee classification.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"Revenue sharing in college athletics is beneficial and will not lead to financial disaster or administrative mess.\", \"argument\": [\"It can boost university finances by increasing wins, fans, and overall revenue.\", \"A successful athletic program enhances the university\\'s image, attracting more students and donations.\", \"Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances.\", \"Increased revenue from more wins and fans will offset the cost of paying athletes.\", \"A good athletic program attracts more students and donations, further boosting revenue.\", \"Seattle PI studies support the positive financial impact of paying athletes.\", \"Models based on percentages are manageable and efficient.\", \"A capped system simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.\", \"Professional sports successfully implement revenue sharing, demonstrating its feasibility.\", \"Studies show systems like the proposed one are manageable and efficient.\", \"It provides a transparent system with a clear formula overseen by an independent entity.\", \"It ensures responsible money management and fair distribution.\", \"It acknowledges the contributions of student-athletes and shares the wealth they help create.\", \"The NCAA generated nearly $1.3 billion in revenue in 2022-23, largely from men\\'s basketball.\", \"Student-athletes are the core of this industry, their talent and dedication driving fan engagement and revenue.\", \"Paying them acknowledges their contributions and shares the wealth they create.\", \"The proposed system ties compensation directly to revenue generated, ensuring fairness.\", \"It addresses financial concerns by tying compensation to revenue.\", \"It promotes fairness by recognizing student-athletes\\' contributions.\", \"It encourages responsible financial planning through delayed payouts.\", \"It invests in the future of young athletes by providing a financial safety net.\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '13_37', 'query': 'Examples of financial challenges faced by athletic departments due to fluctuating revenue', 'title': \"It's time to ask tough questions about college athletic programs | EAB\", 'url': 'https://eab.com/resources/research-report/tough-questions-about-athletic-programs/'}]\n**Short Argument**: The claim that revenue sharing won't lead to financial disaster ignores the precarious financial state of many athletic departments.  \"The Washington Post found 25 institutions in Power Five conferences ran athletic departments with deficits\" (13_37).  Adding significant new expenses like athlete compensation to already strained budgets will likely exacerbate these deficits and could lead to program cuts and further instability.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Profit-sharing could create financial instability for athletic departments.\", \"argument\": [\"Many athletic departments already operate with tight budgets (Huron Consulting Group).\", \"Sharing revenue would exacerbate existing financial challenges, potentially leading to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and other programs.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Revenue sharing in college athletics is beneficial and will not lead to financial disaster or administrative mess.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"It can boost university finances by increasing wins, fans, and overall revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"A successful athletic program enhances the university\\'s image, attracting more students and donations.\\\\\", \\\\\"Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances.\\\\\", \\\\\"Increased revenue from more wins and fans will offset the cost of paying athletes.\\\\\", \\\\\"A good athletic program attracts more students and donations, further boosting revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Seattle PI studies support the positive financial impact of paying athletes.\\\\\", \\\\\"Models based on percentages are manageable and efficient.\\\\\", \\\\\"A capped system simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"Professional sports successfully implement revenue sharing, demonstrating its feasibility.\\\\\", \\\\\"Studies show systems like the proposed one are manageable and efficient.\\\\\", \\\\\"It provides a transparent system with a clear formula overseen by an independent entity.\\\\\", \\\\\"It ensures responsible money management and fair distribution.\\\\\", \\\\\"It acknowledges the contributions of student-athletes and shares the wealth they help create.\\\\\", \\\\\"The NCAA generated nearly $1.3 billion in revenue in 2022-23, largely from men\\'s basketball.\\\\\", \\\\\"Student-athletes are the core of this industry, their talent and dedication driving fan engagement and revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Paying them acknowledges their contributions and shares the wealth they create.\\\\\", \\\\\"The proposed system ties compensation directly to revenue generated, ensuring fairness.\\\\\", \\\\\"It addresses financial concerns by tying compensation to revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"It promotes fairness by recognizing student-athletes\\' contributions.\\\\\", \\\\\"It encourages responsible financial planning through delayed payouts.\\\\\", \\\\\"It invests in the future of young athletes by providing a financial safety net.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Paying athletes will not bankrupt athletic departments.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Increased revenue from more wins and fans will offset the cost of paying athletes.\\\\\", \\\\\"A good athletic program attracts more students and donations, further boosting revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Seattle PI studies support the positive financial impact of paying athletes.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Student-athletes deserve to be compensated for their contributions to the massive revenue generated by college sports.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"The NCAA generated nearly $1.3 billion in revenue in 2022-23, largely from men\\'s basketball.\\\\\", \\\\\"Student-athletes are the core of this industry, their talent and dedication driving fan engagement and revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Paying them acknowledges their contributions and shares the wealth they create.\\\\\", \\\\\"The proposed system ties compensation directly to revenue generated, ensuring fairness.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The proposed revenue-sharing model is fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"It addresses financial concerns by tying compensation to revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"It promotes fairness by recognizing student-athletes\\' contributions.\\\\\", \\\\\"It encourages responsible financial planning through delayed payouts.\\\\\", \\\\\"It invests in the future of young athletes by providing a financial safety net.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '13_5', 'query': 'Financial instability in athletic departments', 'title': \"It's time to ask tough questions about college athletic programs | EAB\", 'url': 'https://eab.com/resources/research-report/tough-questions-about-athletic-programs/'}, {'id': '13_25', 'query': 'Potential negative impacts of revenue sharing on non-revenue generating college sports', 'title': 'The Implications of the NCAA Antitrust Settlement -

Profit-sharing introduces a new, substantial expense that could exacerbate existing budgetary constraints.

education finance, reports that many athletic departments operate with precarious budgets. Their analysis, cited by the Wall Street Journal, reveals that less than half of Power Five athletic departments and even fewer Group of Five departments have built financial reserves.  This finding indicates a systemic vulnerability within college athletics finances. Implementing a profit-sharing model, while potentially beneficial to student-athletes in revenue-generating sports, would likely exacerbate the financial strain on athletic departments. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue-generating sports, as highlighted by Kutak Rock's analysis of the NCAA antitrust settlement, potentially diminishing opportunities for student-athletes and negatively impacting program diversity. While some argue that increased revenue from successful athletic programs could offset these costs, the existing financial instability, coupled with the added expense of profit-sharing, suggests that many departments would struggle to maintain current program offerings, let alone expand them. This financial strain could also lead to increased reliance on institutional subsidies, further diverting resources from other crucial areas of the university.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Logic\n**Our Logic Chain to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Profit-sharing exposes universities to legal and financial liabilities, especially concerning worker\\'s compensation, potentially reducing spending on other important programs.\", \"argument\": [\"Classifying student-athletes as employees triggers worker\\'s compensation obligations (Charlotte NC Workers Compensation Lawyers Group).\", \"Increased worker\\'s compensation claims, due to the high injury rate in college sports, would strain athletic department budgets (AthleticDirectorU).\", \"This financial burden could divert resources from academics and other university programs.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The proposed model does not classify student-athletes as employees, avoiding worker\\'s compensation issues.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"The model uses a trust fund with payouts after graduation or leaving the program.\\\\\", \\\\\"This maintains amateur status and avoids legal and financial risks associated with employee classification.\\\\\", \\\\\"The trust fund approach encourages responsible financial planning and academic focus.\\\\\"]}\"]}', '{\"claim\": \"Implementing profit-sharing necessitates complex accounting and administrative systems, creating operational challenges for universities.\", \"argument\": [\"Tracking revenue and distributing profits based on various factors (performance, gender equity) is complex (Keepr.io).\", \"This complexity creates administrative overhead, diverting resources from core university functions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Tracking revenue and distributing profits will not be an administrative nightmare.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Models based on percentages are manageable and efficient.\\\\\", \\\\\"A capped system simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"Professional sports successfully implement revenue sharing, demonstrating its feasibility.\\\\\", \\\\\"Studies show systems like the proposed one are manageable and efficient.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'profit sharing universities administrative challenges', 'title': 'Top 4 Challenges of Profit Sharing and How to Overcome Them', 'url': 'https://keepr.io/top-4-challenges-of-profit-sharing-and-how-to-overcome-them/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Universities face increased administrative burden with profit-sharing.

        "statements": "They keep saying it's a win-win, but they're ignoring some serious money problems. They say sharing money helps schools, and they mention Seattle PI. But let's be real here.  EAB reports show many athletic departments are already in trouble, lots of Power Five schools are losing money [1].  Paying athletes will probably make things worse, maybe even leading to cuts and instability.  They're optimistic about more money, but winning isn't a sure thing, and even good programs can have money problems.  Imagine your team has a bad season. Suddenly, that extra money's gone, leaving the athletic department in more trouble.\n\nThey say their system is simple, easy to run, pointing to pro sports. But here's the difference: pro sports make money, universities are for education.  Keepr.io shows how complex profit-sharing is, needing complex accounting and legal stuff [2].  Imagine tracking every athlete, team results, gender equity, and following all the rules. This extra work will take money from important things like academics and research.  They also forget about college sports rules, which makes their \"simple\" system more complex.  Comparing it to pro sports hides the administrative mess this would actually be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about their trust fund idea, their answer to workers' compensation.  They say it keeps athletes amateur.  But Bloomberg Law shows us legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening, even without employee status [3].  A $2.75 billion settlement, anyone?  This suggests that the legal risks they dismiss are very real, regardless of how they structure the payments.  A trust fund doesn't magically erase the potential for lawsuits.  So, their claim that this avoids legal issues just doesn't hold up. Imagine you're a university facing a lawsuit from a former athlete, trust fund or not.  The legal costs and potential damage to the university's reputation are significant, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis brings me back to the financial instability of athletic departments. We\u2019ve established that many athletic departments are already struggling. The Wall Street Journal, citing Huron Consulting, found that less than half of Power Five athletic departments, the wealthiest in college sports, have adequate financial reserves [4].  Adding a substantial new expense like athlete compensation would likely exacerbate existing financial difficulties. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and staff, as highlighted by Kutak Rock\u2019s analysis, impacting opportunities for students and the university community [5].  Think about it, if departments are already struggling, how can they afford to share revenue?  The supposed revenue boost from winning is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t guarantee financial stability.  In fact, EAB points out the pressure to win can lead to overspending and even greater financial risk [1].\n\nThey talk about fairness and recognizing contributions.  Yes, student-athletes work hard. But universities already invest in them through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  The current system, though imperfect, provides substantial support. Profit-sharing adds an immense financial burden that threatens the stability of entire athletic programs, impacting not just athletes but the broader university community.  Imagine your school having to cut academic programs or increase tuition to cover the costs of profit-sharing. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, their arguments for profit-sharing fail to address the complex realities of college athletics.  The financial risks, administrative burdens, and legal vulnerabilities are simply too great to ignore.  We urge you to vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

By CLRN team / January 12, 2025 Why Should College Athletes Get Paid? The debate over whether college athletes should be paid has been a contentious issue for years. On one side, some argue that college athletes are already receiving a valuable education, resources, and recognition, and therefore, they should not be compensated financially. On the other hand, others believe that the billions of dollars generated by college sports, particularly in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), should be shared more equitably among the athletes who generate the revenue. The Economic Reality of College Sports Before delving into the why, it\u2019s essential to understand the economic reality of college sports. The NCAA generates $13.6 billion in revenue each year, primarily from television contracts, sponsorships, and ticket sales. 80% of this revenue comes from just three conferences: the Power Five conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC). The remaining 20% is split among the other NCAA divisions, with the majority going to Division I schools. Why College Athletes Deserve Payment So, why should college athletes get paid? Here are some compelling arguments: Athletes are the main attraction: Without talented student-athletes, college sports wouldn\u2019t be the multi-billion-dollar industry it is today. Fans attend games, watch on television, and purchase merchandise to see their favorite players perform. Without the athletes, the revenue streams would dry up. Exploitation: The NCAA and its member institutions benefit significantly from the revenue generated by college sports. However, the athletes, who are often forced to sacrifice academic and personal priorities, receive little to no compensation for their efforts. Gig economy reality: In today\u2019s gig economy, i",

Hey! Curious to hear some thoughts on why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I'd like to consider different perspectives to form my own opinion. Thanks! 11 months ago Hello! It's important to consider various perspectives when thinking about whether college athletes should be paid or not. Here are a few common arguments against paying college athletes: 1. Amateurism: One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is preserving the spirit of amateurism in college sports. This means that student-athletes participate in sports for the love and passion they have for the game, not for financial gain. Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

By CLRN team / December 25, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not be Paid: A Case for a Fair and Ethical System The debate surrounding the issue of paying college athletes has been ongoing for years, with many arguing that these athletes deserve to be compensated for their talents and hard work. However, there are several reasons why college athletes should not be paid, and in this article, we will explore these arguments in depth. The Main Argument: Balance and Fairness The main argument against paying college athletes is that it would create an unfair and unbalanced system. Athletes who play for top-tier colleges and universities already receive a top-notch education, access to top-notch facilities, and access to top-notch training and coaching. If they were to receive a salary, it would put those who attend smaller colleges and universities at a significant disadvantage. It would be unfair to expect those institutions to match the salaries of larger schools, and it would ultimately lead to a system where only the wealthiest institutions could attract the best talent. The Problem of Professionalization Paying college athletes would also professionalize the sport, which would have far-reaching consequences. College sports are meant to be a part of the educational experience, a way for students to develop important skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management. If athletes are paid, it would create a situation where the primary focus is on the game, rather than on the education. This would be a disservice to the athletes, who would be going to college to learn and develop as individuals, rather than as professionals. The Issue of Amateurism vs. Professionalism Another issue is the concept of amateurism. The NCAA is a governing body that regulates colle",

By CLRN team / November 29, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not Get Paid: The debate about whether college athletes should be paid for their participation in sports has been ongoing for years. While some argue that athletes should be compensated for their talents, others believe that paying them would be unfair and potentially disrupt the delicate balance of college sports. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why college athletes should not be paid. The NCAA\u2019s Mission: To Provide Education, Not to Make a Profit The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit organization that governs collegiate athletics in the United States. The primary goal of the NCAA is to provide opportunities for student-athletes to balance their academic and athletic pursuits. The NCAA\u2019s mission is to \"improve the collegiate athletic experience\" by providing a framework for competition, promoting fair play, and ensuring safe environments for athletes. Not All Sports Are Created Equal: Emphasis on Scholarship Opportunities One of the primary arguments against paying college athletes is that scholarships provide a significant amount of compensation for many student-athletes. In fact, over 90% of all NCAA athletic scholarships are awarded to Division I football and men\u2019s basketball players. These scholarships cover tuition, room, and board, as well as other educational expenses, providing significantly more value to athletes in these sports. The Rise of Athletic Conference Schedules and Strength of Schedule The increasing number of athletic conference games and strength of schedule have also raised concerns about the potential for exploitation.

NCAA revenues rose from about $1.14 billion in the previous fiscal year to $1.28 billion. As usual, the bulk of the NCAA's revenue -- $945 million -- came from media rights and marketing deals tied to championship events. The NCAA's deal with CBS and Warner Bros. Discovery for rights to the men's Division I basketball tournament accounts for about $900 million annually. That means the men's tournament brought in about 69% of the NCAA's revenue. The value of the television deal increases yearly and the statements project an increase to more than $1 billion in 2025. The NCAA's expenses reached $1.17 billion, which includes $669 million distributed to the 363 Division I member schools and another $192 million to stage Division I championship events, the men's basketball National Invitational Tournament and other related programs. More than $100 million was also spent on Division II and III championships and programs, including some distributions back to Division II schools. The NCAA has no direct involvement in the operation of the top tier of Division I football, known as the Bowl Subdivision, and the College Football Playoff that determines its champion and brings in about $470 million annually to the conferences that participate. The NCAA is facing at least five antitrust lawsuits, which challenge rules regulating recruiting, athlete transfers and compensation for athletes. House vs. NCAA was recently class certified and could put the association on the hook for a potential multibillion-dollar payout to former and current college athletes. ",

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports.

We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher.

This Alert summarizes the new guidance and provides some going-forward recommendations for athletic departments and coaches. Permissible and Impermissible NIL Activities Although the October Update does not create a comprehensive framework or any new rules, it does clarify the boundaries within which each Division I member school must operate to remain compliant. The October Update outlines the role that member schools may have in facilitating relationships between student-athletes and NIL entities (i.e., brands, collectives, and other organizations interested in paying for the benefit of a student-athlete\u2019s NIL), as well as actions that will draw sc",

                  "raw_content": "US Supreme Court sides with college athletes against NCAA The US Supreme Court has ruled in favour of student athletes in a compensation row with the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). In a unanimous decision, the court said limits on education-related benefits for athletes cannot be enforced. Under current NCAA rules, students cannot be paid, and scholarship money is capped at the cost of attendance. The NCAA defended the rules as necessary to protect the distinction between amateur and professional sport. College sports generated $18.9bn (\u00a313.6bn) in 2019, according to the NCAA, but athletes are unpaid. The NCAA, the main governing body of US collegiate sports, hosts 90 championships in 24 sports, which see more than 57,000 total participants each year. What did the court say? The current and former athletes who filed the case had said the restrictions on compensation amounted to an unlawful restraint of trade. On Monday, the high court agreed, ruling that the NCAA's curbs on non-cash payments, including benefits like computers, musical instruments, academic awards and paid internships, violates a federal law called the Sherman Antitrust Act - meant to outlaw monopolies in business. The student athletes involved in the suit were members of top-tier basketball and American football teams, which generate the most revenue for the NCAA. Writing for the court, Donald Trump nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch said that the NCAA had essentially sought \"immunity from the normal operation of the antitrust laws\". In a concurring opinion, fellow conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh noted that \"the NCAA's business model would be flatly illegal in almost any other industry in America.\" \"The NCAA is not above the law,\" he said. Monday's decision upholds a ruling from a federal appeals court last year. The Biden administration had filed a brief in support of this lower court decision this March.

Key Changes and Impacts Explained Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 19, 2024 College Football The landscape of college athletics is undergoing a significant change. The new NCAA rule allows for direct payment to student-athletes, marking a shift from traditional amateurism. This introduces a new era where athletes can be compensated for their contributions, addressing ongoing debates about fairness and equity in sports. With the NCAA\u2019s push to amend its rules, student-athletes can now benefit from their names, images, and likenesses (NIL) in ways previously prohibited. This is a crucial development for those who compete in high-revenue sports like college football and men\u2019s college basketball. The decision directly affects how universities approach recruitment and athlete support, paving the way for a more equitable system. As this rule takes effect, it raises questions about the balance of power in college sports. Many wonder how this cha",

National Collegiate Athletic Association, 2015) has brought student-athlete compensation to the national spotlight. While the NCAA continues to defend its policy of amateurism, the time for college athlete compensation may soon become a reality (NCAA Division I Manual, 2019). Recent college athlete compensation models have explored revenue sharing models similar to that of professional sports leagues, although previous research failed to develop a compensation model for athletes in sports beyond basketball and football (Huma & Staurowsky, 2013). The current research argues for a more applied, market-economy compensation model to offer fair compensation to collegiate athletes. This model takes into account the revenues generated by each university team, while also accounting for both the student-athlete and team\u2019s performances on and off the field. Justifications for this model are explored, as this model will allow for a new way to compensate athletes via on and off-field metrics. This paper concludes with an example of the model\u2019s utility through using publically accessible data for a major Division I college program.

This change allows college athletes to profit from their personal brand, a shift long overdue in a system historically built on amateurism. The NCAA now supports athletes making money off endorsements, merchandise sales, and social media, opening new doors for financial opportunities. Many athletes have already begun to see life-changing earnings that reflect their efforts and popularity. Critics argue that these payouts could overshadow the importance of education and teamwork, while supporters believe that athletes deserve to be compensated for their contributions to college sports.

Mia R. \u201926 This case study asks the question of whether or not college athletes should be compensated for their contribution to their schools athletic programs? Some key points brought up in the case consist of, the effects that being an athlete has on college students, which individuals are receiving the money brought in by athletes, and the attempts that colleges make to compensate athletes. The case mentions that athletes are being restricted from receiving compensation, however the NCAA receives profits. Although some students receive scholarships, students bring in a lot more money than they receive. When you take these factors into consideration you can use different ethical frameworks to come to an ethical decision. The first ethical framework I used to analyze this case is utilitarianism. When viewing this case from an utilitarian perspective, you would believe that college athletes should be compensated, as well as, the NCAA. A utilitarian should choose the action which benefits the most people overall. By paying athletes they would become more motivated to play, and would perform better. At the same time the NCAA would still receive money. In turn more people would be benefited. The NCAA would be receiving less money if athletes are given salaries,\u00a0 however according to the standard of utilitarianism happiness is defined by the amount of people who are happy and not the amount of happiness one person has. If college athletes did not receive salaries for their time and effort only the NCAA would gain happiness while the athletes would not. Therefore, an utilitarian would believe that college athletes should also receive compensation. I believe that student athletes should be compensated.\u00a0 Compensating student athletes woul",

The NCAA, the governing body of American college athletics, has strict rules against paying athletes. However, there is a growing movement that argues that college athletes should be paid for their services. This movement is fueled by the financial benefits that universities and the NCAA receive from college sports. And this paper examines the ethical and financial implications of paying college athletes. The Case for Paying College Athletes Proponents of paying college athletes argue that athletes generate significant revenue for their universities and the NCAA. According to Forbes, college football generated $5.7 billion in revenue in 2019. And college basketball generated $1.1 billion in revenue that year. These figures demonstrate the significant financial impact that college sports have. Supporters of paying college athletes argue that these athletes deserve to receive a share of the revenue they generate. Progress in AI writing with the help of such a tool https://papertyper.net/ has contributed to the publication of numerous articles on such topics. Paying college athletes will provide them with much needed financial support. The Case Against Paying College Athletes Opponents of paying college athletes argue that college athletes receive numerous benefits that non-athletes do not receive. These benefits include scholarships, free meals, and free housing. Furthermore, paying college athletes would make them employees of their universities, which would have significant legal and financial implications. Additionally, the current system allows for a level playing field, as all college athletes are subject to the same rules and regulations. Paying college athletes would create an unfair advantage for universities with more financial resources.

The debate over whether student athletes should be compensated for their participation in collegiate sports has been a contentious issue for decades. As the popularity of college sports continues to grow, so does the financial benefit to universities and athletic departments. Meanwhile, student athletes themselves often struggle to make ends meet, forced to balance their academic and athletic responsibilities with limited financial support. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the arguments for and against compensating student athletes, examining the legal, ethical, and practical implications of such a move. Why Student Athletes Should be Compensated Revenue Generation College sports generate billions of dollars in revenue: According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), college sports generate over $18 billion in revenue annually, with the majority coming from television contracts, sponsorships, and ticket sales. Student athletes contribute to this revenue: By participating in collegiate sports, student athletes help attract fans, boost merchandise sales, and increase exposure for their universities. Without them, these revenue streams would be significantly reduced. Exploitation Student athletes are treated as commodities: Universities and athletic departments often prioritize winning over the well-being of their student athletes, putting them under intense pressure to perform while providing limited support for their physical and mental health. Athletes are forced to give up their name, image, and likeness: By not allowing student athletes to profit from their own identity, universities and athletic departments benefit financially while athletes receive nothing.

Every year, fans flood football stadiums to get the quarterback\u2019s autograph and drop hundreds on their favorite player\u2019s basketball jersey at the student store. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) is no exception to this phenomenon. If you go to UNC-Chapel Hill, chances are you have snapped a paparazzi-esque picture of a beloved student-athlete on campus. You\u2019ve probably also seen Armando Bacot\u2019s Carolina-Blue Audi cruising down Franklin Street or Deja Kelly repping \u201cTeam Dunkin\u2019\u201d merchandise on social media following her recent brand deal with the company. Although countless Division I athletes have become household names nationwide, they could not reap a single cent from their likeness until recently. In NCAA v. Alston, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the NCAA could no longer enforce rules restricting certain education-related benefits that its members offered to the student-athletes because those restrictions violated antitrust laws. When Governor Roy Cooper signed an Executive Order following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, North Carolina became the 28th state to allow student-athletes to receive compensation for using their name, image, and likeness (NIL). Effective July 2, 2021, student-athletes in North Carolina could also benefit from NIL deals. The policy change has so far proven to be immensely profitable for universities. UNC-Chapel Hill athletes reportedly earned over $1 million in the first year of NIL. This is a conservative estimate since athletes are not required to document these deals with the athletic department, and only one-half of NIL deals were reported. It is safe to say that NIL is a step in the right direction: athletes can now profit from their brand and pursue entrepreneurial ventures within and beyond ",

NIL stands for Name, Image, and Likeness, and it refers to the rights of college athletes to make money from their personal brand. This can include anything from endorsement deals with major brands to paid appearances and social media promotions. The NCAA introduced NIL legislation in July 2021, and since then, the landscape of college athletics has shifted dramatically. Financial Empowerment for Athletes One of the most obvious benefits of NIL deals is the financial empowerment they provide to college athletes. For many students, the ability to earn money while playing college sports can be life-",

Exploring the Impact and Implications Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 18, 2024 College Football The debate surrounding NIL deals has become increasingly relevant in college athletics. As the NCAA starts allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, questions arise about the impact of these changes. NIL deals can provide significant financial benefits to college athletes, but they also introduce potential challenges that could affect their focus and opportunities in sports. Many believe these deals empower athletes by allowing them to monetize their talents, with reports showing that some athletes earn thousands of dollars through endorsements. However, critics argue that this shift could widen the gap between top-tier and lesser-known programs, distracting athletes from their primary goal of competing in sports. Understanding whether NIL deals are ultimately good or bad for college athletes requires examinin",

We present a theoretical analysis of universities that recruit athletes and examine the assumptions that are needed for player compensation to decrease competitive balance. We also empirically illustrate the differences in balance between professional and college sports. Given the theoretical and empirical analysis, we argue that unionization and/or player pay is unlikely to hurt competitive balance.

Introduction Far away from the vistas of Cayuga's waters, Dartmouth College, Cornell's Ivy League sibling, steps into the spotlight as changes rock the landscape of collegiate athletics and reshape the conversation on fair compensation for student-athletes. Earlier this past March, players on the Dartmouth College men's basketball team voted 13\u20132 to join Service Employees International Union Local 560 in Hanover, New Hampshire, marking a historic decision with potentially far-reaching implications for college sports. [1] Despite Dartmouth\u2019s swift appeal of the team\u2019s right to unionize, according to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Dartmouth college basketball players are to be considered employees under the NLRA. This vote marks a revolutionary moment for National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) athletes. Following the wake of failed unionization attempts in the past, an NLRB regional manager cleared the way for this latest push by ruling that Dartmouth\u2019s athletes may vote to establish a union. [2] Despite the vote from student-athletes, it is improbable that this will serve as the definitive resolution, given the Dartmouth administration's resistance to classifying its basketball players as employees of the institution. [3] In a statement from Dartmouth's administrative board, they express pride in their strong community with campus unions while firmly opposing the recent actions taken by the basketball team: \"In this isolated circumstance, however, the students on the men's basketball team are not in any way employed by Dartmouth. For Ivy League students who are varsity athletes, academics are of primary importance, and athletic pursuit is part of the educational experience. Classifying these students as employees simply because they play basketball is as unprecedented as it is inaccurate. We, therefore, do not believe unionizatio",

Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

It\u2019s a multi-billion dollar industry, and third-party companies are making a fortune from it. While the\u00a0NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) earns billions in revenue, it prohibits athletes from earning a single penny. If college students challenge this prohibition, they will no longer be qualified to participate in any of the events organized by the NCAA and might lose their athletic scholarships. So, let\u2019s have a look at the arguments for and against paying college athletes. Tip: Find College Student Jobs on Salarship. Pro 1: College Athletes Bring in Huge Revenues The main argument in favor of paying college athletes is that they bring in a large net amount of revenue to their schools. True: The NCAA makes $18.9 billion annually. This money is spread through administrators, athletic directors, coaches, and media outlets. However, college athletes are not compensated for their contributions. True: Several brands \u2014 Nike, Adidas, Reebok, and plenty of others \u2014 pay schools\u2019 athletics departments\u00a0$100 million a year. They also pay coaches a different sum to encourage students to wear them in unison. However, they also give student-athletes a\u00a0nearly unlimited supply of shoes and sportswear. True: College athletes generate indirect revenues for their schools. The more influential the athlete, the more effective they are at inviting enrollees. This fact\u00a0indirectly increases the internal revenue of the institution.\u00a0Fans of the team are likely to buy any product businesses sell as long as the team\u2019s logo or the player\u2019s face is embellished on the merchandise.\u00a0Other sources of income come from fundraising events, digital materials, and e-games (EA Sports earned over\u00a0$80 million in r",

NIL stands for \u201cName, Image and Likeness.\u201d In the most basic terms, NIL refers to college athletes being allowed to receive financial compensation by profiting from their own personal \u201cbrand.\u201d NIL gives college athletes the right to monetize their \u201cname\u201d and \u201cimage\u201d and receive profits through doing so. Examples of this include being able to sign sponsorship deals with corporate brands and companies, creating one's own brand \u201clogo\u201d or brand merchandise for profit, as well as being able to charge money for things like pictures, cameo videos, and even autographs. In short, \u201cName, Image and Likeness\u201d truly just means that college athletes can leverage their own personal brand for profit. While this policy seems standard, the ability to profit off one\u2019s own brand was not always possible. Since the formation of the NCAA, it has been prohibited for student-athletes to earn anything other than the means of their school scholarship: this means they couldn't sign any brand deals or sponsorships, and couldn't even have any other jobs or ways to receive compensation in any form. Breaking such rules resulted in a loss of eligibility to compete for the athletes' respective school. For context, the NCAA, more formally known as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, is a nonprofit organization that regulates college athletes: as of 2021, the NCAA consists of almost half a million college athletes who compose 19,886 sports teams across 24 sports. The NCAA approved NIL policy on June 30th, 2021\u00a0under an interim \u201cname, image, and likeness\u201d policy. While the policy varies depending on the state, from this date on, it has been legal for student-athletes to receive compensation for their brand. Despite there still being many rules and rights under NIL, which also vary based on the state in which you are a college athlete, NIL policy is a huge step forward in the process o",

By Matthew Stefanski Jr.; Photo Credit: Ashley Cefali/Grand Valley State University On July 1, 2021, the NCAA ushered in a new age in college athletics by adopting an interim policy allowing collegiate athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness (\u201cNIL\u201d) for the first time.[1] This interim NIL policy came in the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston \u2013 occurring just ten days prior \u2013 where the Court ruled narrowly that NCAA rules restricting non-cash compensation for academic related purposes (i.e. computers, internships) failed rule of reason analysis and were violative of federal antitrust law.[2] Alston notably left NCAA rules central to its restriction of NIL intact, including those restricting athletic scholarships and cash compensation for athletic performance.[3] However, this decision raised questions about the validity of these and other central restrictions.[4] Alston indicated that the NCAA would not be able to establish a procompetitive justification for many of its then-in-place NIL restrictions, which is mandated in order to survive rule of reason analysis.[5] As a result, the NCAA interpreted Alston as the nail-in-the-coffin for the pre-NIL age and decided to allow NIL through an interim policy.[6] In the time since the NCAA\u2019s interim NIL policy, the NIL landscape in college football has devolved into a wild west, lacking a meaningful and effective system that governs NIL. NIL today is effectively uncapped and unchecked, allowing the richest Power 5 programs to rise above the rest while damaging lesser programs.[7] Nike co-founder and Oregon alumnus, Phil Knight, has quite literally signed a blank check for his Oregon Ducks football program, pledging unlimited NIL funds to allow for more lucrative NIL deals for potential members of the ",

It was Kampe's biggest win in his 41 years at Oakland, which is located in Rochester Hills, Michigan. But now, he says, his biggest challenge comes off the court. \"I spend my summers trying to raise money so I can buy players,\" Kampe said. \"Can you imagine? College coaches are now saying that because it's true.\" Forget the old definition of an amateur athlete. College athletes can now make millions before ever going pro thanks to a set of NCAA rules loosening former restrictions on players profiting off NIL, which stands for name, image and likeness. As of 2021, any athlete \u2014 especially big stars like Colorado football's Shedeur Sanders and former Indiana basketball sensation\u00a0Caitlin Clark\u00a0\u2014 can profit from commercial endorsements, jersey sales and even autograph sessions. What's really changing the game, though, is another part of the program that's morphed into a monster \u2014 athletes getting paid just to play. Kampe says that when he's recruiting a player, the conversation about financial compensation is \"initial, it's right at the start.\" Schools are tapping deep-pocketed alums and donors to pay millions to high-level athletes. The schools are launching bidding wars for recruits and raiding each other's rosters. Three of Kampe's best players transferred to programs with more money shortly after last year's tournament. \u00a0 \"Some Power Five comes in and offers him $500,000,\" Kampe said. \"OK, I can't offer him that. So how do I tell a kid, 'Don't go take $500,000?'\" An estimated $1.67 billion was spent in 2024 on student-athletes, according to a report from Opendorse, an NIL tech company.

That summer, in response to pressure from laws passed by state legislatures that permitted varying levels of NIL activity, the NCAA created an interim NIL policy: For schools in states with laws on the books, the state law would guide them; otherwise, schools could set their own policies. The NCAA maintained that NIL opportunities could not be used as a recruiting inducement or as payment tied directly to athletic performance (colloquially referred to as pay-for-play). However, the introduction of one type of permissible market for players\u2019 services made clear just how much most players had been undervalued during the preceding decades.

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports. Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball. The 65 universities analyzed are members of the Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern, and Atlantic Coast conferences. More detailed budget breakdowns were available from the 46 public institutions in the sample, but not from sports powerhouse private universities such as Notre Dame and Stanford",

A new poll related to the Supreme Court's recent ruling on National Collegiate Athletic Association restrictions of payments to college athletes found public opinion mixed about whether athletes should be allowed to receive modest payments for their name, image or likeness, or NIL. The court ruled that the NCAA may not bar modest payments to athletes, but a nationally representative survey of 1,000 respondents found that although 60\u00a0percent of the public supported college athletes making money by selling or endorsing products with their own image or likeness, just 26\u00a0percent of the respondents supported paying the athletes directly from university funds, and 45\u00a0percent opposed doing so.

Public opinion on this issue was also sharply divided along political lines. \"Both college sports fans and non-sports fans were in agreement on their support for athletes making money from their own image or likeness -- at 62% and 59% respectively -- but there were differences by political affiliation, with 69% of Democrats and 61% of independents supporting the idea, compared with 42% of Republicans,\" a blog post by the Bucknell institute stated. \"Both fans and non-fans were equally opposed to paying college athletes directly from university funds at 43% and 45% respectively, with 61% of Republicans opposing it, compared to 33% of Democrats.

That's according to a new nationally representative poll of 1,000 individuals conducted by the Bucknell Institute for Public Policy. It found mixed support for student-athletes being paid. The survey results come shortly after a U.S. Supreme Court decision greenlighting colleges to provide players an expanded range of education-related benefits, which was largely viewed as continued erosion of the NCAA's amateurism model. Dive Insight: The center found that 60% of survey respondents supported student-athletes being paid for use of their NIL. It was administered in mid-May, prior to the Supreme Court decision. The issue of players being paid for their personas has taken off. California was first to pass a law, in 2019, authorizing student-athletes to profit from their NIL. Since then, many other legislatures have proposed similar measures. And several are due to take effect July 1. That timing puts the NCAA, which has long prohibited many forms of student-athlete compensation, in a bind.

These agreements allow student-athletes to profit from their personal brands, a shift that has sparked both excitement and concern. Finding effective ways to manage and improve NIL opportunities is crucial for ensuring fairness and sustainability in college athletics. As universities and athletes navigate this new environment, challenges have emerged, such as unequal compensation and regulatory issues. Many stakeholders are calling for clearer guidelines and equitable systems to support all athletes, not just those in high-profile sports.

These revenue streams play a critical role in sustaining and growing college sports programs, supporting athletes, and contributing to the overall financial health of educational institutions. In this article, Jared Kamrass will explore the various revenue streams in college sports and examine how they have turned athletics into a thriving enterprise. 1. Ticket Sales and Game-Day Revenue One of the primary revenue streams in college sports is ticket sales and game-day revenue. Fans eagerly purchase tickets to attend games, generating substantial income for colleges and universities. Additionally, game-day revenue includes revenue from concessions, merchandise sales, parking fees, and premium seating options. The excitement and atmosphere of game days create a significant economic impact, providing financial support to sustain and enhance athletic programs. 2. Sponsorships and Corporate Partnerships Sponsorships and corporate partnerships are instrumental in generating revenue for college sports. Companies across various industries sponsor college sports programs, teams, or specific events, gaining exposure to a passionate fan base. These partnerships often include naming rights for stadiums or arenas, jersey sponsorships, and promotional campaigns. The financial support from corporate sponsors enables colleges to invest in facilities, scholarships, coaching staff, and other aspects that drive the success of their athletic programs. 3. Media and Broadcasting Rights Media and broadcasting rights are major revenue drivers in college spo",

You can make the case that six of those expense categories are directly tied to competition (such as financial guarantees, team travel and sports equipment, uniforms and supplies), four relate to money spent on coaches (salaries, benefits and bonuses paid by the university, those that are paid by a third party, severance payments, and bonuses from bowl games), three categories pertain directly to athletes (athletic student aid, meals, and medical expenses and insurance) and two are for support staff. Plus, there are individual categories for recruiting, spirit groups, and the all-encompassing \u201cother operating expenses\u201d category, which includes expenses related to team banquets and awards, or non-team travel. \u00a0 As annual athletic department revenue has neared, if not cleared, a quarter of a billion dollars at the biggest athletic departments in the country \u2013 Ohio State reported more than $233 million in revenue on its 2020 FRS report compared to $89.7 million in 2005, for example \u2013 how do athletic departments spend their increasing revenue? \u00a0 The short answer: coaches (and their buyouts), support staff, facilities and the sometimes ambiguous but ever-growing \u201cother\u201d category of operating expenses. \u00a0 While an increasing percentage of annual revenue goes to coaches, support and administrative staff members, and facilities, a decreasing percent goes toward expenses that have costs that are relatively fixed, such as athletic student aid, meals or sports equipment, because those expenses have limits \u2013 either limits that are explicitly stated, such as the number of scholarships that are allowed per sport or the types of expenses that can be covered by grants-in-aid, or because of practical limits, such as how many meals athletes can eat in a given year, even thoug",

College athletic departments are preparing for U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken to potentially provide final approval of the settlement in the House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA cases, which would allow for direct revenue sharing with athletes later this year. While many administrators have publicly expressed their school\u2019s intent to participate, most have been understandably shy on specifics. After all, the settlement has yet to be approved and athletic departments are preparing to adjust to new roster limits and how the new category of expenses will fit into their reimagined budgets. Using a combination of public comments and publicly available data, as well as insights from the collectives powered by the agency Student Athlete NIL (SANIL), here are potential revenue-sharing models, based on different athletic department profiles. Texas Tech plans to commit \u2018about 74%\u2019 to football players In a rare example of an athletic department publicly sharing its revenue sharing plans, Texas Tech AD Kirby Hocutt and Deputy AD Jonathan Botros shared the school\u2019s plans with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in December. The school projects to share the maximum of roughly $20.5 million with \u201cabout 74% to football players, 17-18% to men\u2019s basketball, 2% to women\u2019s basketball, 1.9% to baseball and smaller percentages to other sports,\u201d according to the Avalanche-Journal. Texas Tech\u2019s other athletic programs would share the remaining 4.1% to 5.1% of the pie, which is somewhere between $840,000 to $1.05 million. The distribution percentages of Texas Tech\u2019s projected annual revenue share by sport are similar to the share of annual revenue attributed to each program. ADU analyzed the three most recent financial reports that the athletic department submitted to the NCAA. Note that over this span, Texas Tech had an additional $20 million to $32 million in annual revenue classified as \u201cnot related to specific teams,\u201d which wasn\u2019t included in calculating the ",

Behind the scenes, they\u2019re making decisions on if they will participate, how much they will commit and how they will allocate those funds to athletes. Some athletic directors, presidents and conference commissioners are already committing to participate fully, while others are still trying to figure out their budget, the Title IX implications and more. I\u2019ve compiled the public comments made thus far by administrators below and will be updating this post as more schools make their plans known, so bookmark this post. Schools Committing to Revenue Sharing Publicly The schools that have publicly committed to revenue sharing are listed below in alphabetical order.

But the reality is it doesn\u2019t matter if you have Michigan\u2019s budget or Fresno State\u2019s budget or any other budget. There\u2019s a need for revenue, and so I think you always have to be creative looking for revenue streams. And [with] the permissive cap you get from the House settlement, there\u2019s a lot of factors to be determined. Is Title IX going to be applied to it? It looks like the $2B going back the last six years may go [to] a higher percentage of football and men\u2019s basketball players than everyone else because they\u2019re responsible for a lot of the TV revenue but we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to be applied moving forward.

Many expect the proposed settlement to become fully approved this Spring. Still, there has undoubtedly been pushback on specific parameters provided, specifically the new roster limit structure, which may put many student-athletes\u2019 dreams of Division I athletics at risk.\u00a0 Initial Revenue Share Cap Has Been Determined\u00a0 One component of this settlement is that student-athletes will receive up to 22% of the average revenue that Power Conference schools generate annually. Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes. Schools are expected to have total control over how they disperse these funds to their athletes next season. The expectation is that many athletic departments will use approximately 90% of the funds for their football and men",

College athletics impacts the lives of its athletes, the fans, and the communities surrounding the schools. College athletes' and traditional students' extracurricular activities differ greatly based on a variety of factors, such as the NCAA's rules and regulations. The significant hours and revenues generated by student athletes' extracurricular activities have created the discussion of compensation for student-athletes. There are many ethical arguments in the debate to pay student-athletes, such as the vast pay differences and benefits that coaches receive and the amount of money that universities generate from student-athletes' work. There is also a legal argument in compensating student-athletes based on whether or not a college athlete meets the legal definition of an employee of the university. After analyzing the different ethical and legal issues of the debate, I calculate a revenue- sharing option and a wage option for student-athletes compensation. In order to examine the likely impact that compensation would have at various levels of the NCAA, the schools I analyzed are Ohio State University, the University of Houston, and South Dakota State University, and the sports I used are football, men's and women's basketball, and volleyball. Based on my research, smaller schools' athletics departments would need to make significant changes to their budgets in order to compensate their athletes because their athletics department's net income is negative. There is still more work to be done discussing the ethical and financial implications of paying student-athletes and the impact it would have on ",

Mia R. \u201926 This case study asks the question of whether or not college athletes should be compensated for their contribution to their schools athletic programs? Some key points brought up in the case consist of, the effects that being an athlete has on college students, which individuals are receiving the money brought in by athletes, and the attempts that colleges make to compensate athletes. The case mentions that athletes are being restricted from receiving compensation, however the NCAA receives profits. Although some students receive scholarships, students bring in a lot more money than they receive. When you take these factors into consideration you can use different ethical frameworks to come to an ethical decision. The first ethical framework I used to analyze this case is utilitarianism. When viewing this case from an utilitarian perspective, you would believe that college athletes should be compensated, as well as, the NCAA. A utilitarian should choose the action which benefits the most people overall. By paying athletes they would become more motivated to play, and would perform better. At the same time the NCAA would still receive money. In turn more people would be benefited. The NCAA would be receiving less money if athletes are given salaries,\u00a0 however according to the standard of utilitarianism happiness is defined by the amount of people who are happy and not the amount of happiness one person has. If college athletes did not receive salaries for their time and effort only the NCAA would gain happiness while the athletes would not. Therefore, an utilitarian would believe that college athletes should also receive compensation. I believe that student athletes should be compensated.\u00a0 Compensating student athletes woul",

NCAA proposed settlement, NCAA member schools will be allowed to share athletic department revenues with their varsity athletes beginning in the 2025-26 academic year. The initial revenue sharing cap per school has been tentatively set at $ 20.5 million per year. We analyzed the most recent NCAA financial reporting from several public universities and arrived at the following revenue sharing estimates: School Conference Total AD Revenue * 22% of Revenue Est Revenue Sharing 2025 Football & MBB % School Conference Total AD Revenue * 22% of Revenue Est Revenue Sharing 2025 Football & MBB % Washington State Pac-12 57,769,277 12,709,241 12,709,241 97% Colorado State MW 23,259,125 5,117,008 5,117,008 92% North Dakota MVC 11,239,985 2,472,797 2,472,797 25% Idaho Big Sky 5,775,565 1,270,624 1,270,624 87% Showing 1 to 5 of 5 entries These estimates assume each school limits total revenue sharing to 22% of its annual athletic department revenues \u2013 this is the percentage utilized in the proposed settlement in House v NCAA.\u00a0 However, a school can elect to share any percentage (or none) of its athletic revenues as long as the annual total payout does not exceed the $ 20.5 million tentative cap. From our analysis, football and men\u2019s basketball will likely account for close to 95% of revenue sharing at most power conference schools.

What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes.

Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

Athletic departments must strike a delicate balance between generating revenue, supporting student-athletes, and upholding educational values. Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, navigating right and wrong in a high-stakes business becomes complex. Commercialization and Education Critics argue college sports now resemble professional leagues more than extracurricular activities. Multi-million dollar media rights deals, slick marketing, and lavish facilities conflict with academic ideals. Coaches are the top public employees in many states. However, revenues also provide universities with resources benefiting more than just athletes. The mission should remain educating students above profits. Amateurism and Fairness Controversies frequently erupt around NCAA rules restricting payment to athletes. While generating millions for their programs, players receive no direct compensation. However, athletic scholarships have tremendous value. Relaxing amateurism rules too much risks severing college sports from academics. But not sharing revenues more equitably seems profoundly unfair. Nuance is required in rule-making. Student-Athlete Treatment and Welfare With billions of dollars at stake, student-athlete welfare is often forgotten. Their rigorous schedules leave little time for academics or other interests. Pressure to win tempts misconduct like academic fraud. Guaranteeing healthcare, counseling, career support, and developing balanced humans should be the priority. Success on the field can\u2019t eclipse student wellbeing. Integrity and Values Winning and revenue generation cannot outweigh integrit",

Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes.

However, the settlement process is not over, and potentially far from it. The process of officially notifying current and former athletes of the terms and claims procedures is set to begin on Oct. 18. Those who would be covered by the agreement will have the opportunity to object or opt out by Jan. 31, 2025. And a final approval hearing has been scheduled for April 7, 2025. However, additional legal appeals could occur. One former college football player and his attorney tied up a monetary settlement in a previous college-sports compensation case by pursuing the matter to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That bid ultimately failed, but it ended up delaying final resolution by about two years. And the path to this point in these cases has not been perfectly smooth.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

And while money hasn\u2019t completely correlated with sports throughout history, that ideology has completely changed, especially for the NCAA.\u00a0 The NCAA has been pocketing billions of dollars over the years on its product, profiting off of student athletes who receive zero financial compensation. A step in the right direction was made on July 1, 2021, when the NCAA approved a Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policy. Essentially, the policy allows athletes to make money on themselves whether it's doing local commercials, social media promotion, autograph signings, and more. NIL was the first piece to a bigger puzzle. While raking in billions of dollars and not having to pay your superstars has a nice ring to it, the NCAA has officially agreed to a $2.78 antitrust settlement within the five power conferences, and college athletics will be changed forever. Where once paying college athletes seemed otherworldly, that time has passed and now we enter a new era of sports.

The move comes with an unprecedented expansion of UNC\u2019s football name, image, and likeness budget, reportedly increasing from $4 million to $20 million. This change directly addresses the challenges of recruiting through NIL, a key point highlighted by former coach Mack Brown in his exit press conference. This enormous expansion of UNC\u2019s football NIL budget is just one example of the investment programs are making to take their teams to the next level. Belichick, known for his relentless focus on winning championships, has embraced this college role with clear goals. In his interview on The Pat McAfee Show, Belichick declared, \u201cIt\u2019s not about wins to me. It\u2019s about championships. \u201cThe wins are great, and you\u2019ve gotta win games to win championships, and I get that\u201d Belichick noted. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about championships, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d While Belichick\u2019s reported $30 million contract over three years is among the highest in college football, UNC is leveraging his leadership to transition into a new era of NIL-driven recruiting and athlete support. Belichick hopes to lead the Tar Heels to their first National Championship under his leadership.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes.

In a June 28 response to the recent $2.8 billion NCAA settlement, which paves the way for colleges to directly pay their student athletes, TCU provided insight into how it plans to navigate the new collegiate athletics landscape. On Friday, in a newsletter written by athletic director Jeremiah Donati, TCU confirmed its commitment to fully engage with the settlement\u2019s provisions, emphasizing its intent to participate at the highest permissible level in the revenue-sharing plan. TCU is a member of the Big 12 conference, which is one of four power conferences nationwide. The settlement has \u201cunprecedented\u201d implications for Division I institutions, which are poised to reshape college sports by addressing past grievances and implementing forward-looking changes, Duane Miller, a Texas attorney who works on name, image and likeness issues with college student athletes, previously told the Fort Worth Report. The House v. NCAA class-action lawsuit settlement, one of the largest antitrust settlements in U.S. history, includes several critical elements: Schools in the Big 12, Big Ten, Atlantic Coast and Southeastern conferences will end up bearing the brunt of the settlement, the majority of which will be paid to athletes going forward. The Pac-12 is also part of the settlement, even though Washington State University and Oregon State University will be the only league members left by this fall after the other 10 schools leave for other conferences. In the new compensation model, each school will be permitted, but not required, to set aside up to $21 million in revenue to share with athletes per year. As revenues rise, so could the cap. While TCU recognizes the financial implications and projects an annual expense of over $20 million, the investment aligns with the university\u2019s broader vision for its athletics program, Donati said.",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

Biweekly Issues Special Editions Event Info Award Honorees With revenue sharing and direct payments to athletes looming, college sports won\u2019t be the same College athletes have been allowed to benefit financially from their names, images and likenesses only since July 2021. Yet in the three years since the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) approved its initial NIL policy, it has grown into an industry valued at an estimated $1 billion annually. A change on the horizon, though, is expected to significantly alter the landscape \u2014 for both NIL and college athletics. The shift is likely to be a direct result of a $2.8 billion settlement agreement the NCAA reached in May with former college athletes who had filed an antitrust class action lawsuit demanding compensation that had been denied to them. A condition of the agreement, which still must be approved by a judge, would allow school athletic departments to directly share with athletes the revenue from ticket sales and TV contracts. It sets the amount to be shared at 22% of that revenue to start, or roughly more than $20 million per school per year. While NIL allows businesses and organizations to pay athletes for promotional purposes, and for athletes to sell branded and autographed merchandise, the settlement agreement, if approved, would set the stage for colleges and universities to directly pay what amounts to a salary to their athletes. If that happens, experts say, it would be a paradigm shift resulting in collegiate sports looking nothing like what exists now. And that could have major ramifications for UConn, which has Connecticut\u2019s most high-profile college athletic programs, as well as small universities in the state.

Wilken declined to grant preliminary approval earlier this month and set a Sept. 26 deadline for lawyers from both sides to rework parts of the agreement and report back to her. The initial settlement calls for the NCAA and its members to pay $2.78 billion in damages to past and current athletes, who are suing over various restrictions on compensation.

Congress also has seen several bills introduced related to athlete compensation. In October 2020, the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) passed an amendment to its amateur code that permitted athletes to profit from NIL and allows its athletes to mention their intercollegiate athletic participation during promotional activities and appearances.

With student-athletes now being able to profit off of their own name, image and likeness, certain players are set to earn notable income from sponsors and advertisers. This essentially starts the professional clock a little bit earlier, and with a larger paycheck comes greater responsibility. Professional sports leagues have financial training that rookies need to attend before their first season, but the NCAA has never had to deal with educating 18 year olds on how to balance and invest earnings. With the landscape having changed drastically, the NCAA has partnered with Invesco/Invesco QQQ to help teach financial literacy to student athletes. They\u2019ve created a practically named digital game called \u201cHow To Not Suck At Money\u201d. The game is based on fictional college students living in a college town, who are faced with simulated real-life financial decisions and scenarios. \u201cHow To Not Suck At Money\u201d touches on budgeting, banking, credit cards, investing and other topics. Invesco and Invesco QQQ bring financial education to NCAA student-athletes: https://t.co/CWgPba9pSk pic.twitter.com/R76uPYrzM7 Before the game was released to the general student-athlete population, 1,500 students were involved in research and product development to help create a final version that would resonate with their peers. This initiative is coming at just the right time for the NCAA, and hopefully a majority of student-athletes decide to play the game. The great thing about \u201cHow To Not Suck At Money\u201d is that it is applicable to every player across the nation.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

This contradictory business model creates inherent tensions and ethical issues. Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, as revenues grow, the NCAA faces escalating scrutiny around fairness and rights for student-athletes. Restricting Athlete Payment NCAA rules strictly limit student-athletes receiving compensation beyond academic scholarships. Paying salaries or endorsements deals would supposedly erode amateurism. However, critics argue these restrictions exploit players who generate huge revenues without receiving direct benefits. Many demand student-athletes get their fair share of the financial pie. Acquiring an Education Supporters counter that scholarships facilitating an education are the appropriate reward, not income. Sports should primarily broaden college access. Statistics show college athletes often underperform academically and lack resources. Reform should address subpar graduation rates and academics. Paying salaries would only divert focus further from education. Time Commitments Practices, training, film study and travel leave little time for classwork or typical student life. Athletes sacrifice enormously for sports. The NCAA recently began allowing compensation for name, image and likeness rights, but balancing business demands with academics remains a predicament. College sports consume student-athletes. Health and Safety Policies inadequately address the physical demands placed on unpaid amateur players. Long-term healthcare is limited for injured athletes. Concussions and chronic injuries create lifelong health issues",

The traditional model of the \u201cstudent-athlete\u201d is being challenged, as the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) grapples with the ever-evolving landscape of collegiate compensation. The fundamental rule seems simple enough: student-athletes can\u2019t accept money for playing their sports. However, this rule stands in stark contrast to the fact that the NCAA\u2019s multi-billion-dollar industry thrives on these athletes\u2019 participation in their respective sports. This apparent contradiction has sparked a significant debate, and the NCAA is caught in the crosshairs. On Tuesday October 17, 2023, the NCAA went before Congress to express that for college sports to modernize, the athletes must remain students. At a Senate hearing, NCAA President Charlie Baker was among many representatives that spoke about the idea of student athletes being deemed employees of their schools. Baker, as well as Notre Dame athletic director, Jack Swarbrick, explained how \u201cinaction by Congress would lead to a series of court rulings that declare college athletes as employees,\u201d which would dilute the idea of amateurism. Labeling student-athletes as \u201cemployees\u201d would usher in labor contracts, revenue sharing, and an array of benefits previously unexplored in college athletics, but with the challenge of non-uniform implementation across different states. While uniformity through federal legislation sounds convenient, political implications hinder its possibility. Republicans are willing to create a bill, but one that is largely limited to solely replacing a patchwork of state name, image, and likeness (NIL) laws with a national standard. Democrats, on the other hand, want a bill that covers greater athlete protections, such as long-term healthcare and other benefits for players. The hearing also touched on NIL, transfer rules, and athlete health and safety. Most",

This is the reality for many student-athletes, who face uncertain futures despite their talent and hard work once their playing days are over. The career span of professional athletes is significantly shorter than that of individuals in traditional careers, making financial planning essential for student-athletes to prepare for life beyond the field, court, or track. At Wolfpack Wealth Management, we are dedicated to helping student-athletes smoothly transition from sports to financial stability and success. The Reality of Athletic Careers The average career span of athletes in various sports can be surprisingly short. According to the chart provided, professional football players average around 3.5 years, basketball players about 4.8 years, and baseball players 5.6 years. Even in sports with relatively longer careers, like tennis and soccer, athletes only average around 7 and 8 years, respectively. Golf is an outlier, with an average career span of 20 years. This stark contrast highlights that student-athletes must think ahead and plan for a future beyond their athletic endeavors. NIL and Financial Management With the advent of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals, student-athletes can now earn money while still in university. For many, this marks their first real paycheck, introducing them to the complexities of financial management.

To make this shift smooth and fulfilling, a thoughtful approach that encompasses financial stability, personal growth, and the development of new interests is essential. A successful transition often starts long before an athlete\u2019s final game. Though sports careers demand intense focus, it can be incredibly beneficial for athletes to explore potential passions and career paths early on.

Building a network outside the sports world also opens up invaluable support and connections, making the process of entering a new professional sphere less daunting. Financial security is a foundational aspect of life after sports. Athletic careers are often shorter than those in other fields, meaning that earning windows can be limited.

The move comes with an unprecedented expansion of UNC\u2019s football name, image, and likeness budget, reportedly increasing from $4 million to $20 million. This change directly addresses the challenges of recruiting through NIL, a key point highlighted by former coach Mack Brown in his exit press conference. This enormous expansion of UNC\u2019s football NIL budget is just one example of the investment programs are making to take their teams to the next level. Belichick, known for his relentless focus on winning championships, has embraced this college role with clear goals. In his interview on The Pat McAfee Show, Belichick declared, \u201cIt\u2019s not about wins to me. It\u2019s about championships. \u201cThe wins are great, and you\u2019ve gotta win games to win championships, and I get that\u201d Belichick noted. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about championships, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d While Belichick\u2019s reported $30 million contract over three years is among the highest in college football, UNC is leveraging his leadership to transition into a new era of NIL-driven recruiting and athlete support. Belichick hopes to lead the Tar Heels to their first National Championship under his leadership. The Adjustment to Revenue Sharing Florida State Seminoles head coach Mike Norvell has become a prominent figure in preparing for athlete revenue sharing, contributing $4.5 million of his $9.9 million salary to the university\u2019s Vision of Excellence campaign.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

You can make the case that six of those expense categories are directly tied to competition (such as financial guarantees, team travel and sports equipment, uniforms and supplies), four relate to money spent on coaches (salaries, benefits and bonuses paid by the university, those that are paid by a third party, severance payments, and bonuses from bowl games), three categories pertain directly to athletes (athletic student aid, meals, and medical expenses and insurance) and two are for support staff.

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports. Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue. Technological Advancements: Virtual Experiences The pandemic forced many organizations to innovate, and college athletics have been no exception.

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

NIL activities for college athletes are often facilitated by marketplace platforms, such as Opendorse, and backed by school\u2019s donor-driven collectives. In May 2024, the landmark House v. NCAA settlement all but guaranteed that Power 5 schools will need to disperse roughly $20 million per year to their college athletes starting in Fall 2025. However, most details of the groundbreaking revenue-sharing model remain to be seen.\u00a0 This much is clear right now. As NIL grows out of its infancy stage to the brink of a revenue sharing-model,\u00a0top athletes are primed to profit, now more than ever, during their college playing careers. The increasing amount of earning opportunities for college athletes begs the following question: Do Top College Athletes Earn More than the Pros? Blake Lawrence, President of Opendorse, tackled this question by referencing data from NIL at 3: The Annual Opendorse Report. On Page 9 of the report (see above), a data set compares the average expected NIL earnings of the top 25 college athletes with the median league salaries of professional athletes for each respective sport. The values for expected NIL earnings are based on real transactions disclosed through, or processed by, Opendorse between July 1, 2021 and June 7, 2024. As a whole, top college athletes are currently earning only 35.3% of the professional league salaries across the sports of football, baseball, basketball, volleyball, and softball. Notably in Men\u2019s College Basketball and Baseball, the gap is massive between the NIL earnings of top col",

At the heart of this economic ecosystem are the athletic departments of universities, which rely on a combination of traditional and modern income sources to fund their operations and support their student-athletes. Each of these revenue streams plays a unique role in the financial tapestry of college sports. Together, they create a robust and dynamic economy that not only supports the athletic endeavors of student-athletes but also enhances the overall reputation and appeal of the universities they represent. As the landscape of college sports continues to evolve, the balance and importance of these revenue streams may shift, but their collective impact remains undeniable. Analysis of Expenses in College Sports The financial landscape of college sports is a complex interplay of revenue and expenses. While the income streams are critical for the sustenance and growth, the expenditures are equally significant, dictating the operational efficiency and long-term viability of athletic programs. In this section, we delve into the various costs associated with college sports, examining the balance between these expenses and the revenue generated, and highlighting potential financial challenges or disparities. Coaching Salaries: The Price of Expertise One of the most significant expenses for any college sports program is the compensation for coaching staff. Head coaches, especially in high-profile sports like football and basketball, can command salaries that rival those of professional coaches. These salaries are often justified by the revenue potential of successful teams, but they also contribute to a widening gap between the highest and lowest-paid coaches within a university or across different institutions.

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports. Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue. Technological Advancements: Virtual Experiences The pandemic forced many organizations to innovate, and college athletics have been no exception. With limited in-person attendance, institutions leveraged technology to provide virtual experiences, ranging from virtual stadium tours to interactive online fan zones.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

And while money hasn\u2019t completely correlated with sports throughout history, that ideology has completely changed, especially for the NCAA.\u00a0 The NCAA has been pocketing billions of dollars over the years on its product, profiting off of student athletes who receive zero financial compensation. A step in the right direction was made on July 1, 2021, when the NCAA approved a Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) policy. Essentially, the policy allows athletes to make money on themselves whether it's doing local commercials, social media promotion, autograph signings, and more. NIL was the first piece to a bigger puzzle. While raking in billions of dollars and not having to pay your superstars has a nice ring to it, the NCAA has officially agreed to a $2.78 antitrust settlement within the five power conferences, and college athletics will be changed forever. Where once paying college athletes seemed otherworldly, that time has passed and now we enter a new era of sports. Getting\u00a0A Piece\u00a0Of\u00a0The\u00a0Pie College athletes not only want to be paid, but should be getting compensated for their actions.

Dozens of lawsuits against the NCAA are piling up and you can sense a shift in the power of the athletic landscape. Former Alabama head coach Nick Saban brings in an entrancing point of view to the controversy. Labeled as a players coach, Saban has been advocating for a revenue sharing proposition where the athletes are not labeled employees.

The natural, usually first, and perhaps most common answer is that revenue is all income generated. \u00a0But it may not be that simple, and there would need to be some mechanism to verify the revenue reported. California\u2019s proposed College Athlete Protection (CAP) Act (currently not in effect) proposed using annual reports institutions must make under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) for both identifying a revenue number and ensuring transparency. The EADA requires institutions to submit an annual report to the federal government about varsity intercollegiate athletics programs and the financial resources and personnel dedicated to those teams.\u00a0 This reporting requirement arose out of concerns that there was insufficient transparency and inequitable spending in college sports well after Title IX was passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The January 2023 version of the CAP Act defined revenue as the \u201cannual intercollegiate athletics revenue as calculated and ",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

College athletic departments are preparing for U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken to potentially provide final approval of the settlement in the House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA cases, which would allow for direct revenue sharing with athletes later this year. While many administrators have publicly expressed their school\u2019s intent to participate, most have been understandably shy on specifics. After all, the settlement has yet to be approved and athletic departments are preparing to adjust to new roster limits and how the new category of expenses will fit into their reimagined budgets. Using a combination of public comments and publicly available data, as well as insights from the collectives powered by the agency Student Athlete NIL (SANIL), here are potential revenue-sharing models, based on different athletic department profiles. Texas Tech plans to commit \u2018about 74%\u2019 to football players In a rare example of an athletic department publicly sharing its revenue sharing plans, Texas Tech AD Kirby Hocutt and Deputy AD Jonathan Botros shared the school\u2019s plans with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in December. The school projects to share the maximum of roughly $20.5 million with \u201cabout 74% to football players, 17-18% to men\u2019s basketball, 2% to women\u2019s basketball, 1.9% to baseball and smaller percentages to other sports,\u201d according to the Avalanche-Journal. Texas Tech\u2019s other athletic programs would share the remaining 4.1% to 5.1% of the pie, which is somewhere between $840,000 to $1.05 million. The distribution percentages of Texas Tech\u2019s projected annual revenue share by sport are similar to the share of annual revenue attributed to each program. ADU analyzed the three most recent financial reports that the athletic department submitted to the NCAA. Note that over this span, Texas Tech had an additional $20 million to $32 million in annual revenue classified as \u201cnot related to specific teams,\u201d which wasn\u2019t included in calculating the ",

Mind you, a lot of this can change over the next year, as a new regime will be welcomed into the White House, which could have a major impact on how some of the \u2018rules\u2019 are going to be interpreted. There have been a lot of questions surrounding the new revenue-sharing model that is projected to be approved in the coming months, paving the way for schools to start paying athletes from within their own athletic department. Right now, these payments to athletes are mostly coming from outside third-party collectives, which are not legally conjoined with universities. One of the most important parts of the nine-page memo that was released on Thursday pertains to how revenue shared with student athletes is going to be classified in this new era. Going forward, money that is paid from the school to an athlete will be viewed as \u2018financial assistance\u2019, and if they are not proportionally divided, every participating school could be violating federal Title IX laws.

Key Changes and Impacts Explained Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 19, 2024 College Football The landscape of college athletics is undergoing a significant change. The new NCAA rule allows for direct payment to student-athletes, marking a shift from traditional amateurism. This introduces a new era where athletes can be compensated for their contributions, addressing ongoing debates about fairness and equity in sports. With the NCAA\u2019s push to amend its rules, student-athletes can now benefit from their names, images, and likenesses (NIL) in ways previously prohibited. This is a crucial development for those who compete in high-revenue sports like college football and men\u2019s college basketball. The decision directly affects how universities approach recruitment and athlete support, paving the way for a more equitable system. As this rule takes effect, it raises questions about the balance of power in college sports. Many wonder how this cha",

Those changes don\u2019t seem to be ending any time soon either. Just over a week ago, the NCAA\u2019s $2.8 billion settlement in the House v. NCAA lawsuit received preliminary approval. That pushes college athletics a step closer to revenue sharing with student athletes, a change that would have massive financial implications. Southeastern Conference commissioner Greg Sankey was asked at SEC Basketball Tipoff in Birmingham Wednesday what changes a potential revenue-sharing model could bring to sports in the SEC. Sankey was asked specifically how the changes could affect Olympic sports on SEC campuses. He deferred to the schools for specific strategies, but said there will be \u201cadjustments.\u201d \u201cThere are two, maybe three, of our sports that generate net revenue,\u201d Sankey said. \u201cOther than that, there\u2019s a deficit between revenue and expenses. I\u2019ll let our campuses speak to their opportunities. \u201cPart of the reality is it\u2019s an enormous adjustment. It\u2019s an enormous adjustment if you don\u2019t have a 22% increase in expenses and not have impacts.\u201d Sankey stated that the SEC wants to \u201cbe the center of the Olympic development effort,\u201d specifically mentioning track and field and diving. He also mentioned Texas A&M women\u2018s basketball head coach Joni Taylor\u2019s involvement in Olympic basketball. Despite that, Sankey didn\u2019t rule out changes coming to some of those sports. \u201cLong term implications on a number of other sports are real, so our motivation is to keep intact what we have, but there will be adjustments, and I expect that nationally,\u201d Sankey said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a shift of 22% of revenues and not have impacts associated with that.\u201d Sankey never specifically mentioned cutting sports or what any exact changes might look like, but said schools could find ways to make up that revenue, mentioning facility adjustments. \u201cCreate new hub space, create new ways to use your facilities.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits.

One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

When the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was founded in 1906, the organization\u2019s answer was a firm \u201cno,\u201d as it sought to \u201censure amateurism in college sports.\u201d Despite the NCAA\u2019s official stance, the question has long been debated among college athletes, coaches, sports fans, and the American public. The case for financial compensation saw major developments in June 2021, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the NCAA cannot limit colleges from offering student-athletes \u201ceducation-related benefits.\u201d In response, the NCAA issued an interim policy stating that its student-athletes were permitted to profit off their name, image, and likeness (NIL), but not to earn a salary. This policy will remain in place until a more \u201cpermanent solution\u201d can be found in conjunction with Congress. Meanwhile, the landscape continues to shift, with new cases, decisions, and state legislation being brought forward. In 2024, the NCAA signed off on a proposed settlement in response to a class-action anti-trust lawsuit. If finalized, the deal would see the NCAA pay out nearly $2.8 billion to 14,000 current and former student-athletes over the next decade, starting as soon as fall 2025. However, the proposed deal would allow schools to pay out athletes in the future, but would not require it.

The debate on whether college athletes should be paid has been ongoing for years, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. In this article, we will delve into the pros and cons of the issue and provide a balanced perspective on the matter. Direct Answer: Should College Athletes be Paid? In our opinion, yes, college athletes should be paid. The current system, where athletes receive scholarships and educational benefits, is not enough to compensate them for the value they bring to their universities and the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). College athletes generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for their schools and conferences, and it is only fair that they receive a portion of that revenue in the form of compensation. Arguments For Paying College Athletes \u2022 Revenue Generation: College athletes are responsible for generating significant revenue for their universities and conferences. According to a study by the University of Michigan, the athletic department generated $144.4 million in revenue in 2019, with the football team accounting for over $100 million of that total. Basketball and football teams are the most valuable assets for many universities, and their success directly translates to increased revenue. \u2022 Exploitation: Critics argue that college athletes are being exploited by universities and the NCAA, who benefit financially from their talents while they receive little to no compensation. The current system is a form of indentured servitude, where athletes are expected to donate their time and energy to their universities without receiving a fair share of the revenue they generate. \u2022 Fairness: Many argue that paying college athletes is a matter of fairn",

However, many argue that college athletes are not amateurs and should be compensated for their time, effort, and contributions to their universities and the NCAA. Direct Answer: Yes, College Athletes Should Get Paid Why College Athletes Should Be Paid Valuable Asset: College athletes are a valuable asset to their universities and the NCAA. They generate millions of dollars in revenue through ticket sales, merchandise, and television contracts.

Fairness to Non-Athletes: Paying athletes could create unfair competition among universities, with richer programs being able to attract top talent and poorer programs struggling to compete.

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball. The 65 universities analyzed are members of the Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern, and Atlantic Coast conferences. More detailed budget breakdowns were available from the 46 public institutions in the sample, but not from sports powerhouse private universities such as Notre Dame and Stanford",

Smith has seen it all in his four decades in college athletics. National titles. Scandals. Upheaval. He\u2019s also talked about or been involved with seemingly just about every major shift in the space during that time. But college sports have been flipped on their head in recent years. Astronomical media rights payouts and an increasing focus on athlete compensation \u2014 particularly in football and basketball \u2014 are driving discussions toward a revenue sharing model that allows athletes to benefit from the dollars they\u2019re helping steer.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

Files Submission Type Conference Proceeding Location 3:15-3:25pm | Houston Cole Library, 11th Floor Description The landscape of college athletics has changed significantly over the past several years. Due to the ruling from the 2021 court case NCAA v. Alston, athletes are now allowed to earn compensation from their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL). This compensation originates from external sources, such as collectives, donors, and companies, not the academic institutions themselves. The compensation received is determined by each athlete\u2019s specific market/brand value. Social media has become a major factor in defining market value in the modern era of technology. The more \u201cvaluable\u201d the athlete, the more likely for them to receive NIL income. However, there are issues that arise with this new stream of income. They may not realize the responsibilities attached to the new income stream they are receiving, especially the taxation rules that will apply to them. A dearth of tax education for student athletes currently exists. Many athletes do not have any substantial background in financial planning or financial literacy. Mandated guidelines by the NCAA are needed to aid these student athletes or individual institutions to navigate these new financial considerations.

Historically, student athletes were prohibited from profiting from their use of name, image and likeness (NIL) in the participation of National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) \u2013 sanctioned competition.\u00a0 What differentiated professional athletes from collegiate athletes was that distinction of \u201camateurism\u201d created and implemented by the NCAA, which has over the years faced several legal challenges involving unreasonable restraint of trade and antitrust law violations.\u00a0 Recently, the US Supreme Court in Sherman Act. NCAA v. Alston upheld a district court decision that the NCAA rules limiting student athletes from education related compensation violated the Sherman Act, which provided the legal channel permitting NCAA student-athletes to \u201cget paid\u201d for the use of their individual name, image and likeness. Since the Alston decision, the NCAA has adopted a NIL Policy allowing student-athletes the ability to take advantage of their name, image and likeness. Following the Alston decision, many states enacted legislation for student-athletes to profit from their NIL at universities across the United States and for the most part legislation is fairly uniform between states.\u00a0 Here are some notable states that stand out: California: Prohibits a college or university from imposing any rules or regulations that prevent a student from earning compensation as a result of the use of their NILand establishes that such compensation shall not count against the student-athlete\u2019s financial eligibility.

By 18, some athletes earn six-figure deals, while the most elite are cashing checks that rival rookie professional contracts. Yet, behind the headlines and windfalls lies a pressing issue: many athletes need more financial education and resources to turn short-term gains into long-term stability. It is not only the most elite athletes who are at risk: within men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s football and basketball, a healthy portion of players earn six-figure compensation for their talents on the field, not to mention any earnings they make from endorsement deals outside their respective NIL collective deals.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

This paper seeks to determine if participation in collegiate athletics is beneficial to a person or if its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Sixty-seven student-athletes completed a survey during October of 2013 to determine the effects that athletic involvement has had on SDSU\u2019s campus. This study found that participation in athletics is extremely beneficial. These athletes performed better in the classroom, developed impressive time management skills, felt motivated to complete their degree, were motivated to attend classes, and experienced a smoother transition into the college lifestyle.

Davis, CPA, James Moore and Kelleigh Fagan, Partner, Church Church Hittle + Antrim Revenue sharing, employees, broadcast rights, NIL \u2013 these are all frequently referenced in conversations, debates, and policies around collegiate athletics right now.\u00a0 References to student-athletes sharing in athletics revenue is a hot topic and ripe for debate \u2013 could revenue sharing negatively impact Olympic sports, will colleges and universities begin cutting all sports without significant revenues wholesale?\u00a0 There is real fear around the concept of revenue-sharing.\u00a0 That fear, though, has not stopped state legislators, institutions and conferences, and think-tank groups from considering it as a core part of the future of college athletics.\u00a0 Setting aside the policy debate of \u201cshould we or shouldn\u2019t we\u201d, we wanted to unpack what \u201crevenue\u201d really means when it comes to potential revenue sharing models.\u00a0 CCHA teamed up with its financial guru friends at James Moore to analyze this question\u2014What consists of revenue? The natural, usually first, and perhaps most common answer is that revenue is all income generated. \u00a0But it may not be that simple, and there would need to be some mechanism to verify the revenue reported. California\u2019s proposed College Athlete Protection (CAP) Act (currently not in effect) proposed using annual reports institutions must make under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) for both identifying a revenue number and ensuring transparency. The EADA requires institutions to submit an annual report to the federal government about varsity intercollegiate athletics programs and the financial resources and personnel dedicated to those teams.\u00a0 This reporting requirement arose out of concerns that there was insufficient transparency and inequitable spending in college sports well after Title IX was passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The January 2023 version of the CAP Act defined revenue as the \u201cannual intercollegiate athletics revenue as calculated and ",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

The \u201cHouse settlement\u201d refers to three consolidated federal antitrust class action lawsuits brought against the NCAA and Autonomy Five (A5) conferences which are commonly referred to as the House case. These cases allege that the NCAA\u2019s restrictions on the monetization of name, image, and likeness (NIL) payments prevented student-athletes from realizing their true market value. The claimed damages included lost revenues from NIL, broadcast rights, and video games. The parties reached a proposed settlement which received preliminary approval from the court on October 7, 2024, with final approval expected to occur in April 2025 and implementation beginning July 1, 2025. This proposed settlement represents a transformational shift in college athletics. The settlement consists of three major components: Revenue-Sharing and NILUniversities would be permitted to directly share revenues with student-athletes in addition to the benefits that already accompany scholarships: tuition, housing, meals, academic awards, health care, etc. The settlement sets a uniform revenue share cap for all A5 schools equal to 22% of the average media, ticket, and sponsorship revenue. For 2025-26 the revenue share cap for each school is approximately $20.5M and will be periodically recalculated. Each individual school can decide how to distribute the revenue share amongst its sports teams and student-athletes. There is no minimum required distribution. The revenue share is associated with the grant of certain NIL rights to the school and does not create an employment relationship between the school and its student-athletes. The settlement also allows for third-party NIL payments to student-athletes. Those third-party payments must be fair market value payments for a legitimate business purpose and not used for pay-for-play (e.g., merely an inducement to enroll or remain at a particular institution.) Legitimate third-party NIL payments will not count towards the revenue share",

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball.

Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

By CLRN team / January 12, 2025 Why Should College Athletes Get Paid? The debate over whether college athletes should be paid has been a contentious issue for years. On one side, some argue that college athletes are already receiving a valuable education, resources, and recognition, and therefore, they should not be compensated financially. On the other hand, others believe that the billions of dollars generated by college sports, particularly in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), should be shared more equitably among the athletes who generate the revenue. The Economic Reality of College Sports Before delving into the why, it\u2019s essential to understand the economic reality of college sports. The NCAA generates $13.6 billion in revenue each year, primarily from television contracts, sponsorships, and ticket sales. 80% of this revenue comes from just three conferences: the Power Five conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC). The remaining 20% is split among the other NCAA divisions, with the majority going to Division I schools. Why College Athletes Deserve Payment So, why should college athletes get paid? Here are some compelling arguments: Athletes are the main attraction: Without talented student-athletes, college sports wouldn\u2019t be the multi-billion-dollar industry it is today. Fans attend games, watch on television, and purchase merchandise to see their favorite players perform. Without the athletes, the revenue streams would dry up. Exploitation: The NCAA and its member institutions benefit significantly from the revenue generated by college sports. However, the athletes, who are often forced to sacrifice academic and personal priorities, receive little to no compensation for their efforts. Gig economy reality: In today\u2019s gig economy, i",

Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

By CLRN team / December 25, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not be Paid: A Case for a Fair and Ethical System The debate surrounding the issue of paying college athletes has been ongoing for years, with many arguing that these athletes deserve to be compensated for their talents and hard work. However, there are several reasons why college athletes should not be paid, and in this article, we will explore these arguments in depth. The Main Argument: Balance and Fairness The main argument against paying college athletes is that it would create an unfair and unbalanced system. Athletes who play for top-tier colleges and universities already receive a top-notch education, access to top-notch facilities, and access to top-notch training and coaching. If they were to receive a salary, it would put those who attend smaller colleges and universities at a significant disadvantage. It would be unfair to expect those institutions to match the salaries of larger schools, and it would ultimately lead to a system where only the wealthiest institutions could attract the best talent. The Problem of Professionalization Paying college athletes would also professionalize the sport, which would have far-reaching consequences. College sports are meant to be a part of the educational experience, a way for students to develop important skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management. If athletes are paid, it would create a situation where the primary focus is on the game, rather than on the education. This would be a disservice to the athletes, who would be going to college to learn and develop as individuals, rather than as professionals. The Issue of Amateurism vs. Professionalism Another issue is the concept of amateurism. The NCAA is a governing body that regulates colle",

[Image Descriptor: Photo of Chris] Learn about our Editorial Process College athletes should be paid because they bring a substantial amount of money into their colleges, boost admission rates, put in full-time hours, and do not have the time to get a full-time job on top of their sport. And yet, ridiculously, in many sports, it\u2019s illegal to pay college athletes because it\u2019s considered amateur sports. These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

Many college athletes are admitted into colleges on scholarships and have little extra money to support themselves.

By CLRN team / November 29, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not Get Paid: The debate about whether college athletes should be paid for their participation in sports has been ongoing for years. While some argue that athletes should be compensated for their talents, others believe that paying them would be unfair and potentially disrupt the delicate balance of college sports. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why college athletes should not be paid. The NCAA\u2019s Mission: To Provide Education, Not to Make a Profit The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit organization that governs collegiate athletics in the United States. The primary goal of the NCAA is to provide opportunities for student-athletes to balance their academic and athletic pursuits. The NCAA\u2019s mission is to \"improve the collegiate athletic experience\" by providing a framework for competition, promoting fair play, and ensuring safe environments for athletes. Not All Sports Are Created Equal: Emphasis on Scholarship Opportunities One of the primary arguments against paying college athletes is that scholarships provide a significant amount of compensation for many student-athletes. In fact, over 90% of all NCAA athletic scholarships are awarded to Division I football and men\u2019s basketball players. These scholarships cover tuition, room, and board, as well as other educational expenses, providing significantly more value to athletes in these sports. The Rise of Athletic Conference Schedules and Strength of Schedule The increasing number of athletic conference games and strength of schedule have also raised concerns about the potential for exploitation. For example, C__Oliver, a senior at the University of Louisville, made a strong case for the NCAA\u2019s role in maintaining",

A Cross-Sport Comparative Study of Compensation for Independent Contractor Professional Athletes Submitted by: Rod Hilpirt, Scott Wysong, Sheila Hartley, Mike Latino & Andrea Zabkar Abstract: Numerous pay equity studies have been conducted. Many have examined the compensation of professional athletes. However, few studies have compared athlete compensation across sports, which is the objective of this research. Focusing on independent contractor athletes, several analyses were performed to determine how one type of athlete\u2019s (e.g., horse jockeys) earnings from competition (excluding sponsorships, appearance fees, etc.) compare to other types of contracted athletes, such as race car drivers, golfers, bull riders, tennis players, etc. Overall, this exploratory study sheds insight into how the different groups of athletes are paid, and, more importantly, provides a framework for future research that examines the compensation inputs (versus outputs) of each of these groups. Introduction: Salaries for professional athletes continue to escalate each year. From Alex Rodriguez\u2019s record $252 million contract to David Beckham\u2019s $50 million per year enticement to join the LA Galaxy soccer team, most sports fans believe that professional athletes, in general, are overpaid and not worth their salaries. Yet for the professional athlete, maximizing compensation is critical, given the short careers and health risks associated with professional sports. Thus, athletes and their agents often look to see what others within their sport are paid in an effort to negotiate for more money. Few, if any, have compared athlete compensation across sports. While a cross-sport comparison might not be necessary in team professional sp",

This study creates a model of the athlete compensation incentive effect from single and multinomial grouping perspectives, combining empirical research (SEM) with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) based on a sample of 352 validated data. The results lead to two findings. First, athletes\u2019 direct economic compensation, direct non-economic compensation, and indirect non-economic compensation have a significant positive effect on the incentive effect of compensation. Second, that the incentive effect of high compensation has two configurations, namely \u201ceconomic value\u201d and \u201ceconomic environmental value.\u201d It seems that the effective combination of compensation factors can enhance the motivation effect in a \u201cdifferent way.\u201d 1 Introduction Athlete motivation is one of the most important factors influencing the quality development of competitive sports. Motivation is dependent upon an individual\u2019s expectations about their ability to perform tasks and obtain the desired rewards (Yavuz, 2004). To motivate athletes into training, the state has adopted a series of measures, such as the formation of a remuneration structure of \u201cbasic salary & training allowance & bonus and subsidy\u201d in terms of financial compensation. This can be a fair reward for athletes\u2019 hard work and good performance, but also an important way of motivating more people to actively participate in sports. In addition to financial compensation, the government also provides career development opportunities and educational support for outstanding athletes who can participate in high-level training and have access to higher education. Economic and non-economic compensation together constitute a perfect system of compensation system for athletes. Through this approach",

Hi everyone! I'm a junior who's looking into colleges and I'm also really interested in athletics. I was wondering, which college athletic programs are reputed as being the most successful? Let's define success in terms of championship titles, athlete development, and professional drafts. Thanks for your insights! 4 months ago Sure, happy to offer some insight. Traditionally, the following programs continuously stand out for a combination of their championship wins, the development of their athletes and the number of their students who go on to play professionally. In terms of football, the University of Alabama and Clemson University have very strong track records. They've won numerous national championships in recent years and regularly have players drafted into the NFL. For basketball, Duke University and the University of North Carolina have longstanding successful programs on the men's side, while the University of Connecticut and Baylor University are notable on the women's side. Again, all of these schools frequently send players to the NBA and WNBA. For baseball, the University of Florida and Vanderbilt University are worth noting. Vanderbilt and Florida regularly make the College World Series and develop players who go on to have successful MLB careers.

Now that the football season is over, college sports fans have several options. They can argue about whether next year the University of Alabama will defend its 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship title. Or they can turn to watching some of the more than 50 National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball games televised each week. These obvious choices do not exhaust the possibilities for excitement, because the real game is going to be played off the court and in court. That\u2019s because U.S. District Court judge Claudia Wilken will be holding a hearing on motions for summary judgment in the case of Jenkins v. NCAA, a class-action suit that challenges the NCAA\u2019s compensation limits on athletes. According to a recent article in Time magazine by Sean Gregory, \u201cThis could be the last college football championship game with unpaid players.\u201d Representatives for college players are confident that, within the coming year, college athletes will be able to receive payment beyond the current limits of a grant in aid plus cost of living adjusted expenses. And even though almost 69\u00a0percent of respondents surveyed by the NCAA last year expressed opposition to paying college athletes, Gregory suggests that today avid college sports fans may have little problem with such an innovation. Advocates for paying college players justify their cause and case on the grounds that since the NCAA, major conferences, big-time college sports programs and their high-profile coaches make millions of dollars from college sports, the amateur athletes who play the college games that attract spectators deserve to \u201cshare in the bounty.\u201d That may be good news for student athletes who think they are financially exploited.

This is the same with basketball, tennis, football and athletics. College athletes with their sights set on athletic greatness and a potential career in their sports have to regulate themselves to succeed. This article aims to focus on the sport of athletics and shed light on some of the characteristics of successful athletes, outlining their dedication to training, having an eye for the sport, navigating their fighting spirit and staying level-headed. Dedicated to Training One major characteristic of successful athletes is their dedication to training. This is what will set them apart from their peers and hopefully take them on the road to triumph. This is the same with athletics, as it is with hockey or basketball. Athletes who perform well during their\u00a0college basketball\u00a0season, for example, are going to have a far better chance of being chosen as the first draft pick, just like a college athlete who is already breaking records in the semi-professional 100m track race, will also have a better chance at being chosen to represent their country in the Olympics, for example. All of this comes down to training. Athletes who can keep their eye on the ball, dedicate themselves to training, know how to recover, maintain consistency through the year and put training as their number one are likely the ones who are set to be successful. An Eye for the Sport Another characteristic of successful athletes is those who have a knack for the sport, organically. Those who know when it\u2019s time to overtake, when it\u2019s time to lay back and when it\u2019s time to attack and make it over the finish line first.

Under Title IX, athletic departments must provide equitable treatment to both male and female athletes, as well as resolve accusations of sexual misconduct.

Although this would allow victims to avoid facing their attacker in court, it challenges and potentially undermines the Sixth Amendment, guaranteeing the right to due process of confronting and cross-examining witnesses in criminal trials. Additionally, the new revision expands the scope of sexual harassment claims by rewording the rule from \u201csevere, pervasive and objectively offensive\u201d to simply \u201csevere or pervasive.\u201d The definition of sex-based discrimination is broadened under these revisions to include \u201cgender identity\u201d to serve as additional protection for members of the LGBTQ+ community. Relation to NIL The NCAA, previously arguing that college athletes are amateurs rather than employees, is having to reconsider its classification as NIL has allowed athletes to capitalize on their brands through endorsements, sponsorships, and other commercial ventures.

This will have an impact on how name, image, and likeness contracts are handled, how schools handle equity measures via Title IX reporting, and how athletes and schools approach unionization efforts by athletes.... more less There has long been a debate over whether college athletes\u2014who can generate millions of dollars for their universities\u2014should get paid. A major turning point in that debate occurred in early 2024, when the NCAA agreed to a proposed settlement in a class-action suit, commonly referred to as House vs. NCAA, which paves the way for schools to start sharing broadcast revenue with players. The settlement, which applies to the five biggest collegiate conferences, still needs to be approved by the judge\u2014who has already asked the parties to revisit parts of the deal. But in broad terms, it allows for back pay for players from 2016 on and stipulates that going forward, players will get a significant share of the broadcast-revenue pot. One matter to be settled is whether payments to athletes by groups of boosters will be allowed\u2014and if s",

NIL came in on top of that. \u201cIt became the most transformative period in college athletics not only because of NIL but because all three things happened around the same time.\u201d The result significantly impacted college recruiting, and it started with limited outbound recruitment. Before the pandemic, coaches would meet with families and recruits in their homes, building a comprehensive picture of the athlete on and off the field. High school coaches also benefited from those recruitment visits, receiving valuable information from college coaches. Both parties felt the effect of COVID-19 restrictions. For nearly two years, athletes could not properly visit the campuses of schools they were interested in playing for, and face-to-face interactions with coaches or staff were severely limited. Athletes lost opportunities for increased exposure, and recruiters missed out on the critical eye test, limiting the ability to understand all aspects of a player fully. The pandemic alone would have been disruptive enough but then came a significant rule change to the NCAA Transfer Portal. Since 2018, the Transfer Portal has been an integral part of the recruitment process, impacting collegiate and current high school athletes hoping to compete at the next level. Many have likened it to free agency in professional sports, and competition is no longer relegated to peer athletes of the same graduation year ",

If you're wondering what NIL stands for, it's 'Name, Image, and Likeness.' This might sound like legal jargon, but stick with me\u2014it's about to get really interesting. In this post, we\u2019ll explore how the NIL era has transformed college sports recruiting, the challenges it presents, and the opportunities it opens up. Let's get started! What is the NIL Era? First things first, let's break down what the NIL era actually means. Back in the day, college athletes weren't allowed to make money off their name, image, or likeness. This meant no endorsement deals, no sponsored posts, nothing. But in 2021, the NCAA finally lifted these restrictions. Now, college athletes can cash in on their fame, and it's changing the game in a big way. Imagine you're a star quarterback at a major university. Before the NIL era, you couldn't make a dime off your popularity. But now, you can sign deals with sports brands, appear in commercials, and even start your own merchandise line. It's a whole new ballgame, and it's having a massive impact on how colleges recruit athletes. The Impact on Recruiting So, how exactly is the NIL era changing college sports recruiting?

Coaches are leaving, fans are uneasy and even those remaining in seat are restless. Name Image Likeness (also known as NIL), the transfer portal and the recruiting cycle are the current state of college football that could alter the sport for the worse permanently. These changes have made the sports arguably seem more like a professional one more than ever before. These changes are explored more in detail in this article: NIL \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Name Image Likeness came about a few years ago, and is the allows for student athletes to make money off of their personal brand. The argument from traditional college football fans is that these athletes are mostly on full scholarship, and that the value of that is enough alone. And because of it, players should not have to be compensated any more than that. When the NCAA made NIL allowable in 2021, the appeal of a level of amateurism that existed in college sports suddenly disappeared. What NIL has also done is make it very hard for smaller schools with less of a budget to compete. The larger schools with more boosters and fan support such as Alabama, Georgia and LSU as far as the SEC goes have even more of a chance to separate themselves now compared to the likes of South Carolina and Kentucky for example. Recruiting use to be based on talent alone. And once a player was brought on campus, it was all about development under that coach and program. NIL has changed the came on that as the power is in the hands of the player. Where they do often times depends on how large of an NIL deal they can get.

Exploring Concerns Over College Athletics and Recruitment Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 23, 2024 College Football Many college coaches express concerns about the new landscape of college athletics created by Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) agreements. Coaches often feel that NIL deals disrupt the competitive balance in college sports by allowing some athletes to gain significant financial advantages. This can influence their decisions on where to play. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has changed rules to let athletes profit from their identities, but this shift has left many coaches struggling to adapt. Additionally, the lack of clear regulations around NIL has made it challenging for coaches to formulate strategies. The uncertainty can lead to frustrations as they try to keep their teams competitive without fully understanding how these deals will impact recruitment and team dynamics. Coaches worry that the emphasis on money might",

While it\u2019s true that NIL altered the landscape and changed the game of college recruiting, it doesn\u2019t tell the whole story. \u201cThe disruption in college football, particularly, is not all NIL-specific,\u201d said Bryan Bedford, CEO of the Bedford Agency and Recruit Route. \u201cDuring the pandemic, there was no outbound recruiting. Then, there was a major update to the Transfer Portal and the addition of the one-time transfer exception. NIL came in on top of that. \u201cIt became the most transformative period in college athletics not only because of NIL but because all three things happened around the same time.\u201d The result significantly impacted college recruiting, and it started with limited outbound recruitment. Before the pandemic, coaches would meet with families and recruits in their homes, building a comprehensive picture of the athlete on and off the field. High school coaches also benefited from those recruitment visits, receiving valuable information from college coaches. Both parties felt the effect of COVID-19 restrictions. For nearly two years, athletes could not properly visit the campuses of schools they were interested in playing for, and face-to-face interactions with coaches or staff were severely limited. Athletes lost opportunities for increased exposure, and recruiters missed out on the critical eye test, limiting the ability to understand all aspects of a player fully. The pandemic alone would have been disruptive enough but then came a significant rule change to the NCAA Transfer Portal. Since 2018, the Transfer Portal has been an integral part of the recruitment process, impacting collegiate and current high school athletes hoping to compete at the next level. Many have likened it to free agency in professional sports, and competition is no longer relegated to peer athletes of the same graduation year ",

Coaches are leaving, fans are uneasy and even those remaining in seat are restless. Name Image Likeness (also known as NIL), the transfer portal and the recruiting cycle are the current state of college football that could alter the sport for the worse permanently. These changes have made the sports arguably seem more like a professional one more than ever before. These changes are explored more in detail in this article: NIL \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Name Image Likeness came about a few years ago, and is the allows for student athletes to make money off of their personal brand. The argument from traditional college football fans is that these athletes are mostly on full scholarship, and that the value of that is enough alone. And because of it, players should not have to be compensated any more than that. When the NCAA made NIL allowable in 2021, the appeal of a level of amateurism that existed in college sports suddenly disappeared. What NIL has also done is make it very hard for smaller schools with less of a budget to compete. The larger schools with more boosters and fan support such as Alabama, Georgia and LSU as far as the SEC goes have even more of a chance to separate themselves now compared to the likes of South Carolina and Kentucky for example. Recruiting use to be based on talent alone. And once a player was brought on campus, it was all about development under that coach and program. NIL has changed the came on that as the power is in the hands of the player. Where they do often times depends on how large of an NIL deal they can get. And inevitably, that is going to come from larger schools more often than not, further creating a separation.

Administrators, coaches, and stakeholders across the spectrum of small college athletics have increasingly embraced this new era and enhanced their support to help every athlete succeed. For our team at Opendorse, this momentum is clear. In addition to partnerships with over 70 Non-Division I institutions, we have developed strategic relationships with leading associations and conferences including the NAIA, NJCAA, MIAA (D2), KCAC (NAIA), and OAC (D3). We also recently announced the Opendorse Bowl Series, a historic event featuring top teams from four Division III conferences (HCAC, NCAC, OAC, and PAC). Despite the media\u2019s focus on NIL in Division I sports, make no mistake; these new rights have created opportunities and impact at every level. Real Opportunity at Every Level In addition to our role as a partner for institutions and athletic departments, Opendorse works hand-in-hand with brands and businesses to discover athletes and complete NIL deals. Since NIL\u2019s inception in 2021, more than 400 small college athletes have used Opendorse to complete commercial NIL opportunities with brands.

We didn't expect it to be much smaller, but we just didn't know how it would be going forward.\u00e2\u0080\u009d As Division 1 athletes across the country have made money with the new rules in place, Jones said it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not just the schools facing challenges, but athletes at smaller schools too. Jones said there are two challenges in helping students understand the limits and dangers of contracting. Jones said the second challenge is helping students understand the opportunities and how not to interfere with their collegiate careers both academically and athletically.\u00a0 \"The purpose of education is to help the whole student and helping them understand that somebody who is offering them a contract may be binding them to something going forward that's not to their advantage,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jones said.\u00a0 There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been concern that the new NIL rules could create an extra burden on smaller schools who don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have the resources to oversee it all, but Jones sees more people becoming involved to help. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe beauty of it is that there are a lot of people jumping in to hel",

College athletic departments are preparing for U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken to potentially provide final approval of the settlement in the House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA cases, which would allow for direct revenue sharing with athletes later this year. While many administrators have publicly expressed their school\u2019s intent to participate, most have been understandably shy on specifics. After all, the settlement has yet to be approved and athletic departments are preparing to adjust to new roster limits and how the new category of expenses will fit into their reimagined budgets. Using a combination of public comments and publicly available data, as well as insights from the collectives powered by the agency Student Athlete NIL (SANIL), here are potential revenue-sharing models, based on different athletic department profiles. Texas Tech plans to commit \u2018about 74%\u2019 to football players In a rare example of an athletic department publicly sharing its revenue sharing plans, Texas Tech AD Kirby Hocutt and Deputy AD Jonathan Botros shared the school\u2019s plans with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in December. The school projects to share the maximum of roughly $20.5 million with \u201cabout 74% to football players, 17-18% to men\u2019s basketball, 2% to women\u2019s basketball, 1.9% to baseball and smaller percentages to other sports,\u201d according to the Avalanche-Journal. Texas Tech\u2019s other athletic programs would share the remaining 4.1% to 5.1% of the pie, which is somewhere between $840,000 to $1.05 million. The distribution percentages of Texas Tech\u2019s projected annual revenue share by sport are similar to the share of annual revenue attributed to each program. ADU analyzed the three most recent financial reports that the athletic department submitted to the NCAA. Note that over this span, Texas Tech had an additional $20 million to $32 million in annual revenue classified as \u201cnot related to specific teams,\u201d which wasn\u2019t included in calculating the ",

The landmark agreement introduces a revenue-sharing model that has the potential to reshape how schools support student-athletes and manage their athletic departments.\u00a0 With a revenue share structure expected to take effect next year, universities are strategizing to adapt to Division I College Athletics\u2019 new financial needs. Many expect the proposed settlement to become fully approved this Spring. Still, there has undoubtedly been pushback on specific parameters provided, specifically the new roster limit structure, which may put many student-athletes\u2019 dreams of Division I athletics at risk.\u00a0 Initial Revenue Share Cap Has Been Determined\u00a0 One component of this settlement is that student-athletes will receive up to 22% of the average revenue that Power Conference schools generate annually. Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes. Schools are expected to have total control over how they disperse these funds to their athletes next season. The expectation is that many athletic departments will use approximately 90% of the funds for their football and men",

The trio of class-action lawsuits challenged various NCAA rules, including a prior ban on student-athletes profiting from their name, image, and likeness (NIL), as well as limits on their pay and benefits. The settlement (if approved by the court) would create a new system where colleges and universities \u2014 for the first time in history \u2014 may pay student-athletes through a revenue-sharing framework. While the settlement, which is in the process of being finalized, has generated considerable excitement among student-athletes, many issues must still be resolved before schools can hand out paychecks. Here are the top three things colleges and universities need to know as you prepare for this sea change. 1. What Happened? The NCAA\u2019s $2.8 billion agreement is set to take effect in the Fall of 2025 and would be funded by the NCAA and Division I institutions. The settlement would provide funds to student-athletes for the years 2017-2020, a period during which athletes were prohibited from earning NIL revenue. Beyond compensating past athletes, the settlement includes a future revenue-sharing model where schools may share a portion of their athletic revenue with athletes.\u00a0Previously, academic scholarships represented the primary form of \u201ccompensation\u201d available to student-athletes.

Texas Tech\u2019s other athletic programs would share the remaining 4.1% to 5.1% of the pie, which is somewhere between $840,000 to $1.05 million. The distribution percentages of Texas Tech\u2019s projected annual revenue share by sport are similar to the share of annual revenue attributed to each program. ADU analyzed the three most recent financial reports that the athletic department submitted to the NCAA.

The natural, usually first, and perhaps most common answer is that revenue is all income generated. \u00a0But it may not be that simple, and there would need to be some mechanism to verify the revenue reported. California\u2019s proposed College Athlete Protection (CAP) Act (currently not in effect) proposed using annual reports institutions must make under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) for both identifying a revenue number and ensuring transparency. The EADA requires institutions to submit an annual report to the federal government about varsity intercollegiate athletics programs and the financial resources and personnel dedicated to those teams.\u00a0 This reporting requirement arose out of concerns that there was insufficient transparency and inequitable spending in college sports well after Title IX was passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The January 2023 version of the CAP Act defined revenue as the \u201cannual intercollegiate athletics revenue as calculated and ",

AICPA & CIMA: Name, image, liability Historically, student-athletes participating at NCAA colleges and universities could not make money based on their name, image, or likeness (NIL). However, in fall 2019, California passed S.B. 206, the Fair Pay to Play Act, allowing college athletes to be paid for their NIL and regulating the practice. California\u2019s law took effect in September 2021. Other states followed suit. Since then, more than two dozen states have passed NIL laws (see NIL Network, \u201cNIL State Laws\u201d). In 2020, NCAA President Mark Emmert\u00a0made a plea\u00a0before Congress to enact restrictions on NIL deals and practices, but to date, Congress has not done so. With 13 states\u2019 laws set to take effect on July 1, 2021, the NCAA suspended its previous NIL rules on June 30, 2021, and created interim rules allowing NIL payments under certain guidelines. Subsequently, the college athletics world has been flooded with NIL deals for student-athletes to represent and promote brands and companies. Additionally, many large university alumni bases are organizing NIL \u201ccollectives,\u201d business entities that pool money from alumni and athletic boosters to fund and facilitate NIL deals. Most NIL collectives are for-profit, but some have filed for Sec. 501(c)(3) tax-exempt, not-for-profit status. Now, more than ever, student-athletes need help when it comes to tax planning and financial literacy (see the sidebar, \u201cTips for Student-Athletes\u201d). As part of the ruling by the NCAA board of directors, student-athletes are not considered employees of universities or NIL entities. Rather, they are independent contractors, and the companies sponsoring them are not required to withhold or remit federal or state income tax, Social Security tax, or Medicare tax.

NCAA v. Alston upheld a district court decision that the NCAA rules limiting student athletes from education related compensation violated the Sherman Act, which provided the legal channel permitting NCAA student-athletes to \u201cget paid\u201d for the use of their individual name, image and likeness. Since the Alston decision, the NCAA has adopted a NIL Policy allowing student-athletes the ability to take advantage of their name, image and likeness. Following the Alston decision, many states enacted legislation for student-athletes to profit from their NIL at universities across the United States and for the most part legislation is fairly uniform between states.\u00a0 Here are some notable states that stand out: California: Prohibits a college or university from imposing any rules or regulations that prevent a student from earning compensation as a result of the use of their NILand establishes",

Athletes will be required to opt into the lawsuit in order to receive compensation and if players opt in to receiving compensation, they will waive their right to bring cases against the NCAA in the future.\u00a0 The co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, Steve Berman, gave ESPN a better insight into what the compensation will likely look like. The amount of total compensation per athlete will be determined by a formula created by a sports economist. Factors such as player recruiting ratings, and career snap count will go into determining the market value of the player and the just compensation.\u00a0 The other major agreement out of the settlement allows universities to now pay players directly starting in 2025.\u00a0 Each university part of the Big 10, SEC, Big 12 and ACC will have around a $20 million budget to give to their athletes, with the budget set to increase over time.

In his article, Blue described the structural challenges surrounding the growing expenses in big-time college athletics. He noted three economic components that inform athletic directors\u2019 financial decisions: A non-profit organizational structure, zero-sum competition, and accelerating revenue. First, Blue highlighted the non-profit organizational structure of college sport. Athletic departments don\u2019t have owners looking for a return on investment, and thus, sport leaders are not inclined to operate with the goal of turning a profit. With this, economic decisions are informed based on college sport missions, supposedly things like athlete development, gender equity, academic primacy, and long-term sustainability. Financial decisions are also\u2014arguably predominantly\u2014based on winning. Thus, because college sport is a non-profit, when revenues continue to rise, as we\u2019re seeing right now, expenses simultaneously increase in order to achieve the mission(s). Second, Blue discussed college sports\u2019 zero-sum environment: One team or program must win, and thus, another must lose. The competitive and zero-sum design of intercollegiate athletics creates what Blue called \u201can insatiable desire for an athletics program to make investments that drive success in the competitive part of its mission.\u201d The drive to win thus increases departmental expenses. Third, Blue described the trend of accelerating revenues in college athletics, something other non-profit fields do not similarly experience. Once again, since the non-profit mission of college athletics is not to create return on investment or generate surplus revenue, as revenue accelerates, so too do expenses. He concluded these three factors pressurize expenses, increasing departmental spending. And because of the design of ",

As university administrators and coaches continue figure out how to navigate college athletes\u2019 ability to profit from the use of their name, image and likeness, an anticipated settlement in an antitrust case that would bring revenue sharing to collegiate sports will have even a more significant impact on an already complicated environment. On Thursday, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken will consider a proposed settlement between the NCAA and Power Five athletic conferences that would allow schools to directly pay players. Wilken declined to grant preliminary approval earlier this month and set a Sept. 26 deadline for lawyers from both sides to rework parts of the agreement and report back to her.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Colle",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

By CLRN team / January 12, 2025 Why Should College Athletes Get Paid? The debate over whether college athletes should be paid has been a contentious issue for years. On one side, some argue that college athletes are already receiving a valuable education, resources, and recognition, and therefore, they should not be compensated financially. On the other hand, others believe that the billions of dollars generated by college sports, particularly in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), should be shared more equitably among the athletes who generate the revenue. The Economic Reality of College Sports Before delving into the why, it\u2019s essential to understand the economic reality of college sports. The NCAA generates $13.6 billion in revenue each year, primarily from television contracts, sponsorships, and ticket sales. 80% of this revenue comes from just three conferences: the Power Five conferences (ACC, Big 12, Big Ten, Pac-12, and SEC). The remaining 20% is split among the other NCAA divisions, with the majority going to Division I schools. Why College Athletes Deserve Payment So, why should college athletes get paid? Here are some compelling arguments: Athletes are the main attraction: Without talented student-athletes, college sports wouldn\u2019t be the multi-billion-dollar industry it is today. Fans attend games, watch on television, and purchase merchandise to see their favorite players perform. Without the athletes, the revenue streams would dry up. Exploitation: The NCAA and its member institutions benefit significantly from the revenue generated by college sports. However, the athletes, who are often forced to sacrifice academic and personal priorities, receive little to no compensation for their efforts. Gig economy reality: In today\u2019s gig economy, i",

Hey! Curious to hear some thoughts on why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I'd like to consider different perspectives to form my own opinion. Thanks! 11 months ago Hello! It's important to consider various perspectives when thinking about whether college athletes should be paid or not. Here are a few common arguments against paying college athletes: 1. Amateurism: One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is preserving the spirit of amateurism in college sports. This means that student-athletes participate in sports for the love and passion they have for the game, not for financial gain. Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

By CLRN team / December 25, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not be Paid: A Case for a Fair and Ethical System The debate surrounding the issue of paying college athletes has been ongoing for years, with many arguing that these athletes deserve to be compensated for their talents and hard work. However, there are several reasons why college athletes should not be paid, and in this article, we will explore these arguments in depth. The Main Argument: Balance and Fairness The main argument against paying college athletes is that it would create an unfair and unbalanced system. Athletes who play for top-tier colleges and universities already receive a top-notch education, access to top-notch facilities, and access to top-notch training and coaching. If they were to receive a salary, it would put those who attend smaller colleges and universities at a significant disadvantage. It would be unfair to expect those institutions to match the salaries of larger schools, and it would ultimately lead to a system where only the wealthiest institutions could attract the best talent. The Problem of Professionalization Paying college athletes would also professionalize the sport, which would have far-reaching consequences. College sports are meant to be a part of the educational experience, a way for students to develop important skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management. If athletes are paid, it would create a situation where the primary focus is on the game, rather than on the education. This would be a disservice to the athletes, who would be going to college to learn and develop as individuals, rather than as professionals. The Issue of Amateurism vs. Professionalism Another issue is the concept of amateurism. The NCAA is a governing body that regulates colle",

[Image Descriptor: Photo of Chris] Learn about our Editorial Process College athletes should be paid because they bring a substantial amount of money into their colleges, boost admission rates, put in full-time hours, and do not have the time to get a full-time job on top of their sport. And yet, ridiculously, in many sports, it\u2019s illegal to pay college athletes because it\u2019s considered amateur sports. These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

While some argue that athletes should be compensated for their talents, others believe that paying them would be unfair and potentially disrupt the delicate balance of college sports. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why college athletes should not be paid. The NCAA\u2019s Mission: To Provide Education, Not to Make a Profit The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit organization that governs collegiate athletics in the United States. The primary goal of the NCAA is to provide opportunities for student-athletes to balance their academic and athletic pursuits. The NCAA\u2019s mission is to \"improve the collegiate athletic experience\" by providing a framework for competition, promoting fair play, and ensuring safe environments for athletes. Not All Sports Are Created Equal: Emphasis on Scholarship Opportunities One of the primary arguments against paying college athletes is that scholarships provide a significant amount of compensation for many student-athletes. In fact, over 90% of all NCAA athletic scholarships are awarded to Division I football and men\u2019s basketball players. These scholarships cover tuition, room, and board, as well as other educational expenses, providing significantly more value to athletes in these sports. The Rise of Athletic Conference Schedules and Strength of Schedule The increasing number of athletic conference games and strength of schedule have also raised concerns about the potential for exploitation.

Mark McCareins Michael Meier Mark McCareins There has long been a debate over whether college athletes\u2014who can generate millions of dollars for their universities\u2014should get paid. A major turning point in that debate occurred in early 2024, when the NCAA agreed to a proposed settlement in a class-action suit, commonly referred to as House vs. NCAA, which paves the way for schools to start sharing broadcast revenue with players. The settlement, which applies to the five biggest collegiate conferences, still needs to be approved by the judge\u2014who has already asked the parties to revisit parts of the deal. But in broad terms, it allows for back pay for players from 2016 on and stipulates that going forward, players will get a significant share of the broadcast-revenue pot. One matter to be settled is whether payments to athletes by groups of boosters will be allowed\u2014and if so, how they will be regulated. This is among the questions the judge in the case sent negotiators back to the table to resolve. While the details are being hammered out, one thing is clear: big-time college sports are facing some big changes. \u201cThe broadcasting pot has gotten so large that the idea of agreeing to not pay the performers who helped generate those fees was deemed an illegal antitrust agreement,\u201d explains Mark McCareins, a clinical professor of business law at the Kellogg School and an expert in antitrust issues. McCareins points out that the settlement will likely impact three parts of the college-sports landscape: current name, image, and likeness (NIL) programs where colleges are allowed to pay for their use of athletes\u2019 intellectual property, colleges\u2019 approaches to Title IX requirements, and possible player-unionization efforts.

Now that the football season is over, college sports fans have several options. They can argue about whether next year the University of Alabama will defend its 2018 College Football Playoff National Championship title. Or they can turn to watching some of the more than 50 National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball games televised each week. These obvious choices do not exhaust the possibilities for excitement, because the real game is going to be played off the court and in court. That\u2019s because U.S. District Court judge Claudia Wilken will be holding a hearing on motions for summary judgment in the case of Jenkins v. NCAA, a class-action suit that challenges the NCAA\u2019s compensation limits on athletes. According to a recent article in Time magazine by Sean Gregory, \u201cThis could be the last college football championship game with unpaid players.\u201d Representatives for college players are confident that, within the coming year, college athletes will be able to receive payment beyond the current limits of a grant in aid plus cost of living adjusted expenses. And even though almost 69\u00a0percent of respondents surveyed by the NCAA last year expressed opposition to paying college athletes, Gregory suggests that today avid college sports fans may have little problem with such an innovation.

As the NCAA starts allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, questions arise about the impact of these changes. NIL deals can provide significant financial benefits to college athletes, but they also introduce potential challenges that could affect their focus and opportunities in sports. Many believe these deals empower athletes by allowing them to monetize their talents, with reports showing that some athletes earn thousands of dollars through endorsements.

But what impact will the NIL revolution have on college sports as a whole? Caitlin Clark took the sports world by storm during the 2023\u20132024 season with the University of Iowa women\u2019s basketball team. The 22-year-old broke records, both on the court and with the crowds of people she attracted to come watch her play. She also led her team to a second consecutive national championship game and was named the top women\u2019s college basketball player for a second consecutive season.\u00a0 At the end of the thrilling run, some people believed Clark would be better off forgoing the WNBA draft, in which she was the consensus number one pick, and returning to Iowa for another season. Years ago, it would have seemed illogical and, frankly, reckless for someone like Clark to pass up a guaranteed contract and instead return to college athletics, where players risk potentially lowering their draft stock, or worse, suffering a major injury.\u00a0 Clark ultimately declared for the draft and was selected first overall by the Indiana Fever.

In 2016, CBS and Turner Broadcasting extended their contact with the NCAA Division 1 basketball tournament with an 8-year, $8.8 billion extension. That placed the value of March Madness at more than $1 billion per year for the first time in history. The extension in 2016 followed a 2010 contract which offered a 14-year agreement to broadcast the annual tournament for $10.8 billion. The NCAA states that 90% of the revenues generated through the games played by student athletes go into services, programs, or direct distribution opportunities which directly benefit member conferences and schools. Aside from equipment access, medical care, scholarships, and travel support, student athletes receive zero compensation for their participation in their chosen support.By definition, paying the athlete would make them a professional. On the other hand, it could be argued that scholarships are an alternative form of payment already being provided. Because of the revenues their activities generate, the pros and cons of paying college athletes are closely scrutinized. List of the Pros of Paying College Athletes 1. It encourages healthier student athletes. Paying college athletes for their participation in sports eliminates the need for them to find outside employment to support themselves. Many scholarships may offer tuition, room, and board coverage in return for participating in a sport, but not every student athlete qualifies for a scholarship. Walk-on players have their images used to generate revenues for the NCAA too for zero compensation. Paying all athletes would allow them to focus on academics and athletics without worrying about making ends meet. 2. It provides relief for families. Families ",

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports. Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue. Technological Advancements: Virtual Experiences The pandemic forced many organizations to innovate, and college athletics have been no exception. With limited in-person attendance, institutions leveraged technology to provide virtual experiences, ranging from virtual stadium tours to interactive online fan zones.

And while individual sports programs -- even in Division I schools -- don't necessarily turn a profit, the many other benefits to colleges have far-reaching implications for students, faculty and community. Athletics programs drive enrollment and heighten college profiles, often resulting in financial windfalls for the institutions that happen far away from fields and arenas. Direct Profits For select colleges, athletics programs bring in big money. Media rights, ticket sales, branding and direct program donations total millions of dollars. A 2008 analysis conducted by ESPN noted just how profitable programs are to some schools. The University of Alabama athletic department raked in nearly $124 million, thanks in large part to the storied reputation of its Crimson Tide football program. The school saw revenue of more than $13 million from media and branding rights, almost $30 million in donations and $28 million in ticket sales.

Reasons Why or Why Not January 3, 2022\u00a0 Tables of Contents Since its inception in 1906, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has governed intercollegiate sports and enforced a rule prohibiting college athletes to be paid. Football, basketball, and a handful of other college sports began to generate tremendous revenue for many schools in the mid-20th century, yet the NCAA continued to prohibit payments to athletes. The NCAA justified the restriction by claiming it was necessary to\u00a0protect amateurism\u00a0and distinguish \u201cstudent athletes\u201d from professionals. The question of whether college athletes should be paid was answered in part by the Supreme Court\u2019s June 21, 2021, ruling in\u00a0National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston, et. al.\u00a0The decision affirmed a lower court\u2019s ruling that blocked the NCAA from enforcing its rules restricting the compensation that college athletes may receive. Participating in sports benefits students in many ways: It helps them focus, provides motivation, builds resilience, and develops other skills that serve students in their careers and in their lives. The vast majority of college athletes will never become professional athletes and are happy to receive a full or partial scholarship that covers tuition and education expenses as their only compensation for playing sports. Athletes playing Division I football, basketball, baseball, and other sports generate revenue for their schools and for third parties such as video game manufacturers and media companies. Many of these athletes believe it\u2019s unfair for schools and businesses to profit from their hard work and talent without sharing the profits with them. They also point out that playing sports entails physical risk in addition to a considerable investment in time and effort. This guide considers the reasons for and against paying college athletes, and the implications of recent court rulings and legislation on college athletes, their schools, their sports, and the role of th",

A policy adopted in June 2021 by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) dramatically changed the trajectory of college sports when it allowed student athletes the opportunity to use their personal brand in promoting a company\u2019s products and services under paid marketing agreements with third parties. Some observers say this new policy is a departure from the standard of \u201camateurism\u201d that has stood as the NCAA hallmark of college sports. Others argue that student athletes are subject to unique pressures that other students do not have and therefore they deserve to be paid beyond the compensation they receive in the form of sports scholarships. For example, student athletes face a higher risk of injury which could affect their future career prospects. In addition, student athletes contend with the challenge of balancing a heavy academic workload with the time demands of their sport which may prevent them from holding a part-time job to earn extra income. Craig Esherick, academic program coordinator of the Sport Management program within George Mason University\u2019s School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management (SRTM), recently discussed the pros and cons of whether student-athletes should be paid. NCAA\u2019s \u201cName, Image, and Likeness\u201d policy has changed the landscape of college sports. Throughout its history, the NCAA has classified student-athletes as amateurs and has prohibited schools from paying these individuals to play. Instead, student-athletes receive sports scholarships covering room, board, books, tuition, and other costs of attendance. The classification of student-athletes as being amateurs and the ban on paying student-athletes a salary has always been what distinguishes college sports from professional sports. But the NCAA\u2019s 2021 \u201cName, Image, and Likeness\u201d (NIL) interim policy, along with other recent developments, has made this distinction less clear. The NIL policy allows student athletes to monetize the use of the",

Dozens of sports provide opportunities for teens to earn scholarships so that they can pursue a degree while they play, but critics of this system say that isn\u2019t nearly enough compensation compared to what could go wrong. College coaches are usually one of the highest-paid state employees as well. Some basketball and gridiron football coaches earn salaries of more than $3 million per year. That means their wages are sometimes higher than their professional counterparts. If a school does well in a specific sport, then it may qualify for financial bonuses from a variety of institutions. Should student-athletes receive a portion of that since they earned it with their performance? On February 20, 2019, Zion Williamson had one of his shoes explode on him while playing basketball. The consensus best college athlete for the season and future #1 NBA draft pick suffered a sprained knee. If he were to step onto the court again, then he would be placing his future at risk while the college and the apparel company sponsoring the program stood to bring in millions of dollars of profit because of the exposure. There are several advantages and disadvantages to consider when looking at the idea of paying college athletes a stipend that goes beyond what they receive with their scholarship. List of the Advantages of Paying College Athletes 1. Paying athletes would eliminate the need for additional employment. Scholarships might pay for books, tuition, and the other common costs of going to college, but they don\u2019t pay every expense that a student might have. It is not unusual for athletes to find a job outside of their sport and classroom schedule so that they have some spending money to use.

By CLRN team / December 26, 2024 Should Student Athletes be Compensated? The debate over whether student athletes should be compensated for their participation in collegiate sports has been a contentious issue for decades. As the popularity of college sports continues to grow, so does the financial benefit to universities and athletic departments. Meanwhile, student athletes themselves often struggle to make ends meet, forced to balance their academic and athletic responsibilities with limited financial support. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the arguments for and against compensating student athletes, examining the legal, ethical, and practical implications of such a move. Why Student Athletes Should be Compensated Revenue Generation College sports generate billions of dollars in revenue: According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), college sports generate over $18 billion in revenue annually, with the majority coming from television contracts, sponsorships, and ticket sales. Student athletes contribute to this revenue: By participating in collegiate sports, student athletes help attract fans, boost merchandise sales, and increase exposure for their universities. Without them, these revenue streams would be significantly reduced. Exploitation Student athletes are treated as commodities: Universities and athletic departments often prioritize winning over the well-being of their student athletes, putting them under intense pressure to perform while providing limited support for their physical and mental health. Athletes are forced to give up their name, image, and likeness: By not allowing student athletes to profit from their own identity, universities and athletic departments benefit financially while athletes receive nothing.

Firstly, it can provide them with financial stability, allowing them to focus more on their academics and athletics without worrying about their financial situation. This can lead to improved performance both in the classroom and on the field. Secondly, it can serve as a form of compensation for the time and effort they put into their sport, which often goes beyond the commitment of a typical student. Lastly, it can also help to attract talented athletes to a school, enhancing the school's athletic program and overall reputation. <h2 style=\"font-weight: bold; margin: 12px 0;\">How might paying student-athletes affect their academic performance?</h2>The impact of paying student-athletes on their academic performance can be multifaceted. On one hand, the financial stability provided by payment can reduce stress and allow athletes to devote more time and energy to their studies.

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing.

These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

He\u2019s also talked about or been involved with seemingly just about every major shift in the space during that time. But college sports have been flipped on their head in recent years. Astronomical media rights payouts and an increasing focus on athlete compensation \u2014 particularly in football and basketball \u2014 are driving discussions toward a revenue sharing model that allows athletes to benefit from the dollars they\u2019re helping steer.

There are several reasons given in support for both sides. Some rationales supporting the payment of student athletes include college athletes expenditure of time towards their sport\u2014an average of 43.3 hours per week, college athletes struggle to make ends meet, paying students would only make the sport more competitive, the money earned from athletics is not automatically reinvested in education and research, the college sports apparel market capitalizes specifically on these players, payment would help athletes leave school with a degree and little debt, and the NCAA is an $11 billion industry which should be able to afford paying people on all levels, including the players.. \u00a0 Common arguments against the payment of student athletes encompass a lack of college athletic programs to \u00a0afford to pay athletes, elite college athletes receive athletic scholarships which serves as a form of compensation, there is no fair way to pay college athletes, students are not professionals, paying student athletes will cause cuts elsewhere, and paying college athletes will ruin college sports. \u00a0 One of the major arguments used by the NCAA is the preservation of its amateurism model and the fact that the players are student-athletes. According to the NCAA, an amateur is a person that \u201cdoes not have a written or verbal agreement with an agent, has not profited above his/her actual and necessary expenses or gained a competitive advantage in his/her sport.\u201d There has been pushback and litigation against the NCAA and its resistance to pay student athletes.

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

While colleges may be inclined to share more funds with the programs that generate the most revenue, attorneys and academics caution that doing so can open those schools up to litigation under workplace civil rights laws and Title IX of of the 1972 Education Amendments. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re going to feel an enormous pull to spend their money on football because that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where they make their money,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Michael LeRoy, a University of Illinois College of Law professor who researches college athletes. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf schools give in to that temptation, they will be defendants in Title IX lawsuits.

ByKevin Miller| The College Football Playoff National Championship trophy | Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports The world of NCAA athletics has changed dramatically over the past several years. NIL, the growing ease of use of the transfer portal, and seemingly never-ending changes to conference alignment and postseason tournaments has made things hard to follow for fans. This has been seen most in college football. The changes keep coming, too, as Thursday saw the long-expected announcement that revenue sharing was coming for college sports. According to reports from all over the sports media world, all five power conferences (yes, the Pac-12 still counts...for now) have agreed, in conjunction with the NCAA, on a revenue-sharing settlement that will affect payouts to past, present, and future collegiate athletes for the money that has been made, is being made, and will be made by utilizing the athletes\u2019 names, images, and likenesses. Plenty of details still have to be worked out before anything is finalized, but according to On3's Pete Nakos, NCAA member institutions will be able opt into a proposed plan to share $20 Million of revenue annually with the athletes at the school. How much will go to which players has not yet been determined, but Title IX is still a factor that must be consid",

A recent NCAA settlement, which allows for revenue sharing of up to $20 million per year with athletes starting in 2025, does not address Title IX compliance specifics, leaving institutions to navigate these decisions independently. Title IX mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must ensure gender equity in sport, which includes equal opportunities, benefits, and financial aid based on sex.\u00a0 Schools must continue to offer equal athletic opportunities without discriminating in the provision of financial aid, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for OCR, wrote in a statement to ESPN. She also emphasized that the principles of Title IX remain unchanged in the new environment, which allows student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness.\u00a0 OCR did not specify whether the new revenue share would be categorized as financial aid, which traditionally requires proportional distribution based on roster spots. This ambiguity forces athletic departments to make potentially contentious decisions such as distributing revenue equally, which could undermine football recruiting competitiveness, or risk legal challenges by favoring male athletes. The lack of federal guidance adds complexity, as schools must avoid gender disparities in benefits and opportunities, regardless of the funding source. Universities are exploring different models, including channeling funds through third parties for endorsement deals, but must ensure these practices comply with Title IX requirements.\u00a0 Schools are awaiting clarity on these regulations, which might only come through future legal rulings or potential legislative action. In the meantime, they must balance compliance with gender eq",

These rents are primarily generated by men\u2019s football and men\u2019s basketball programs. We characterize these economic rents using comprehensive revenue and expenses data for college athletic departments between 2006 and 2019, and we estimate rent-sharing elasticities to measure how rents flow to women\u2019s sports and other men\u2019s sports and lead to increased spending on facilities, coaches\u2019 salaries, and other athletic department personnel. Using complete roster data for every student-athlete playing sports at these schools in 2018, we find that the rent-sharing effectively transfers resources away from students who are more likely to be black and more likely to come from poor neighborhoods towards students who are more likely to be white and come from higher-income neighborhoods.",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

Behind the scenes, they\u2019re making decisions on if they will participate, how much they will commit and how they will allocate those funds to athletes. Some athletic directors, presidents and conference commissioners are already committing to participate fully, while others are still trying to figure out their budget, the Title IX implications and more. I\u2019ve compiled the public comments made thus far by administrators below and will be updating this post as more schools make their plans known, so bookmark this post. Schools Committing to Revenue Sharing Publicly The schools that have publicly committed to revenue sharing are listed below in alphabetical order. Fresno State Incoming Fresno State AD Garrett Klassy didn\u2019t fully commit to revenue sharing, but I decided to include his initial thoughts where he said they will likely participate in revenue sharing \u201cat some level.\u201d \u201cI actually don\u2019t start till July 23 and we\u2019re speaking on July 9, so I haven\u2019t done a deep dive into the budget yet because I think that\u2019s going to determine a lot of things. But the reality is it doesn\u2019t matter if you have Michigan\u2019s budget or Fresno State\u2019s budget or any other budget. There\u2019s a need for revenue, and so I think you always have to be creative looking for revenue streams. And [with] the permissive cap you get from the House settlement, there\u2019s a lot of factors to be determined. Is Title IX going to be applied to it? It looks like the $2B going back the last six years may go [to] a higher percentage of football and men\u2019s basketball players than everyone else because they\u2019re responsible for a lot of the TV revenue but we don\u2019t know how that\u2019s going to be applied moving forward.

College athletics preparing for every conundrum as revenue sharing promises to reshape landscape From obscene NIL payments to governing shifts, universities are facing scenarios never before seen at this level Word leaked last month that BYU was in the business of offering small forward AJ Dybantsa $3 million-$4 million in name, image and likeness (NIL) riches that would land the No. 1 recruit in the Class of 2025 in Provo. The Cougars apparently weren't the only ones. Along with BYU, Kansas and Kansas State are also considered main pursuers of Dybantsa. Never mind that figure perhaps being the largest for any college basketball player to date, it didn't make basketball sense.\u00a0 \"Four million [for one player]?,\" an administrator for a blue-blood program said, \"Then you play with four dogs.\" The obvious meaning: there wouldn't be enough money left in just about any revenue-sharing pie to surround Dybantsa with meaningful complementary players.\u00a0 The assertion is the latest example of guerilla budgeting going on as the revenue sharing era approaches. Assuming the House v. NCAA settlement will be formally approved in April, the questions now are stacking up like defensive linemen during a goal-line stand. Revenue sharing -- the $20.5 million tranche of annual money schools have the option of funding -- would essentially open the (sanctioned) pay-for-play era.\u00a0 \"This is the way it should be modeled for a rest of eternity,\" said Sedona Prince, a TCU center for women's basketball and an original House plaintiff. \"Literally, the foundation of college sports is changing forever.\"\u00a0 Clarity on how and whether to spend that windfall of revenue sharing is slowly coming into focus: if fully funded, football would get the overwhelming share of that $20.5 million at a particular school -- between $10 million-$15 million annually for the next 10 years; men's basketball would get between $2 million-$4 million; the remainder \u2013 a fraction, really \u2013 would go",

The move comes with an unprecedented expansion of UNC\u2019s football name, image, and likeness budget, reportedly increasing from $4 million to $20 million. This change directly addresses the challenges of recruiting through NIL, a key point highlighted by former coach Mack Brown in his exit press conference. This enormous expansion of UNC\u2019s football NIL budget is just one example of the investment programs are making to take their teams to the next level. Belichick, known for his relentless focus on winning championships, has embraced this college role with clear goals. In his interview on The Pat McAfee Show, Belichick declared, \u201cIt\u2019s not about wins to me. It\u2019s about championships. \u201cThe wins are great, and you\u2019ve gotta win games to win championships, and I get that\u201d Belichick noted. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s about championships, and that\u2019s what I\u2019m most proud of.\u201d While Belichick\u2019s reported $30 million contract over three years is among the highest in college football, UNC is leveraging his leadership to transition into a new era of NIL-driven recruiting and athlete support. Belichick hopes to lead the Tar Heels to their first National Championship under his leadership.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

Revenue sharing in college athletics is coming, but only collective bargaining will provide a true solution Setting the college sports landscape perfectly will take more than just giving the players a cut of the money In 2011, 300 college football and basketball players from Arizona, Kentucky, Purdue and UCLA petitioned the NCAA demanding a cut of television revenue. They were told such a move is not \"fiscally possible.\" What followed was an early effort toward cost of attendance which involved increasing scholarships by $2,000. That all seems laughable by today's standards. Nowadays, the players -- along with their representatives, boosters and agents -- are dictating terms. There are unionization efforts at Dartmouth and a de facto players association at UAB. The current structure still can't wrap its collective mind around an employee-employer relationship in college athletics governed by collective bargaining. It's coming, though. It's necessary.\u00a0 A\u00a0large-scale revenue-sharing model is in the developing stages, which essentially reveals the endgame in all of this. With players and reps now dictating terms, this seems to be the only way the current a resolution is met.\u00a0 But while revenue sharing represents forward thinking that's needed in today's climate, it only puts a thumb in the dike.\u00a0 The whole intent at this point is to stop the spigot of antitrust lawsuits.

And so are we preparing for it? The answer is no, we're not,\" Crowe recalled. \"That is not an outcome which is conducive, in my view, to the success of the pluralistic, gender-balanced, college-sports framework that we presently have in the United States.\" All the same, the NCAA and major college sports conferences are facing yet another antitrust lawsuit \u2014 among other legal and political challenges \u2014 that could force decision-makers to reckon with a reality where some athletes are paid employees or at least get money in a revenue-sharing model that looks a lot like professional sports. House vs. the NCAA is a class-action lawsuit being heard in the Northern District of California by Judge Claudia Wilken, whose previous rulings in NCAA cases paved the way for college athletes to profit from their fame and for schools to direct more money into their hands. One of the rulings was appealed all the way to the Supreme Court, where justices ruled 9-0 against the NCAA in 2021. Justice Brett Kavanaugh's blistering, concurring opinion from the Alston case still rings out. \"Nowhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate,\" Kavanaugh wrote.

Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week. The NCAA Board of Governors also must approve the deal. If the bid to move the fourth case to California is rejected, it could continue in Colorado.

The process of officially notifying current and former athletes of the terms and claims procedures is set to begin on Oct. 18. Those who would be covered by the agreement will have the opportunity to object or opt out by Jan. 31, 2025. And a final approval hearing has been scheduled for April 7, 2025. However, additional legal appeals could occur. One former college football player and his attorney tied up a monetary settlement in a previous college-sports compensation case by pursuing the matter to the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. That bid ultimately failed, but it ended up delaying final resolution by about two years. And the path to this point in these cases has not been perfectly smooth. Lawyers representing three separate groups of athletes filed oppositions to preliminary approval. Then, during a hearing on Sept. 5, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken said she would not approve the original version of the proposed settlement \u2014 for set of reasons that differed from those expressed in the oppositions. On Sept. 26, the lawyers who crafted the proposed settlement filed an adjusted version of the agreement. The updated version addressed Wilken\u2019s concerns about how the original version defined the types of entities and individuals whose current NIL agreem",

Subject to the agreement\u2019s approval by a federal judge, schools would be able to directly pay their athletes, an extraordinary change for an association and member schools and conferences that had spent years and tens of millions of dollars in legal and lobbying costs fighting the idea. Under the settlement plan, there would be a damages of about $2.8 billion - most of which is to be paid to compensate current and former athletes who, for years, had been prohibited from getting paid for a variety of activities and accomplishments that now can result in significant cash. Within \u2013 and beyond \u2013 that, there are still many questions. Here is a look at some of those questions and where things stand with them. At least for now. What are the specifics of NCAA revenue plan with athletes? At its most basic level, the plan presumably set to being in 2025-26 academic year initially will guided by a cap of 22% of the combined total of certain revenues of Power Five conference schools. Among the revenues being counted for this are those from media rights deals, ticket sales and sponsorships. NCAA representatives said Thursday night the dollar amount for the cap is set to increase annually and would be re-set further, depending on whether the applicable revenues increase substantially (think, new or renegotiated TV contracts). It will be up to the schools to determine how they want to spread this money among their athletes. NCAA representatives said Thursday night the idea is to provide schools with flexibility. And school athletics officials already have been considering how to proceed. Asked recently whether his department has been planning internally for how it would adjust to revenu",

In this article, Jared Kamrass\u00a0 delve into the ethical dimensions of college sports, examining the balance between profit-seeking endeavors and upholding core values in education. 1. Student-Athlete Welfare One of the primary ethical considerations in college sports is the well-being of student-athletes. Balancing rigorous training schedules, academic responsibilities, and competitive pressures can take a toll on the physical and mental health of student-athletes. Institutions must prioritize the health and safety of their athletes, providing proper medical care, mental health support, and reasonable workloads. 2. Fair Compensation The issue of fair compensation for student-athletes has been a subject of debate. Ethical questions arise around whether student-athletes should receive financial compensation beyond scholarships and stipends. Balancing the desire for fair compensation with the principle of amateurism, which has long been a core value in college sports, presents a complex ethical challenge. 3. Academic Integrity Upholding academic integrity is essential in college sports. Ethical concerns arise when student-athletes are steered towards easy or less rigorous courses to accommodate their athletic commitments. Institutions must maintain academic standards and ensure that athletes receive a genuine education. 4. Compliance with Regulations The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) sets rules and regulations governing college sports. Ethical considerations include ensuring institutions and athletes adhere to these rules. Violations, such as recruiting infractions an",

Athletic departments must strike a delicate balance between generating revenue, supporting student-athletes, and upholding educational values. Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, navigating right and wrong in a high-stakes business becomes complex. Commercialization and Education Critics argue college sports now resemble professional leagues more than extracurricular activities. Multi-million dollar media rights deals, slick marketing, and lavish facilities conflict with academic ideals. Coaches are the top public employees in many states. However, revenues also provide universities with resources benefiting more than just athletes. The mission should remain educating students above profits. Amateurism and Fairness Controversies frequently erupt around NCAA rules restricting payment to athletes. While generating millions for their programs, players receive no direct compensation. However, athletic scholarships have tremendous value. Relaxing amateurism rules too much risks severing college sports from academics. But not sharing revenues more equitably seems profoundly unfair. Nuance is required in rule-making. Student-Athlete Treatment and Welfare With billions of dollars at stake, student-athlete welfare is often forgotten. Their rigorous schedules leave little time for academics or other interests. Pressure to win tempts misconduct like academic fraud. Guaranteeing healthcare, counseling, career support, and developing balanced humans should be the priority. Success on the field can\u2019t eclipse student wellbeing. Integrity and Values Winning and revenue generation cannot outweigh integrit",

College athletics impacts the lives of its athletes, the fans, and the communities surrounding the schools. College athletes' and traditional students' extracurricular activities differ greatly based on a variety of factors, such as the NCAA's rules and regulations. The significant hours and revenues generated by student athletes' extracurricular activities have created the discussion of compensation for student-athletes. There are many ethical arguments in the debate to pay student-athletes, such as the vast pay differences and benefits that coaches receive and the amount of money that universities generate from student-athletes' work. There is also a legal argument in compensating student-athletes based on whether or not a college athlete meets the legal definition of an employee of the university. After analyzing the different ethical and legal issues of the debate, I calculate a revenue- sharing option and a wage option for student-athletes compensation. In order to examine the likely impact that compensation would have at various levels of the NCAA, the schools I analyzed are Ohio State University, the University of Houston, and South Dakota State University, and the sports I used are football, men's and women's basketball, and volleyball. Based on my research, smaller schools' athletics departments would need to make significant changes to their budgets in order to compensate their athletes because their athletics department's net income is negative. There is still more work to be done discussing the ethical and financial implications of paying student-athletes and the impact it would have on ",

This paper seeks to determine if participation in collegiate athletics is beneficial to a person or if its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Sixty-seven student-athletes completed a survey during October of 2013 to determine the effects that athletic involvement has had on SDSU\u2019s campus. This study found that participation in athletics is extremely beneficial. These athletes performed better in the classroom, developed impressive time management skills, felt motivated to complete their degree, were motivated to attend classes, and experienced a smoother transition into the college lifestyle.

Abstract The purpose of this study was to analyse the effect that participating in extracurricular sporting activities has on academic performance among students in higher education. Prior research on this topic has yielded contradictory results: while some authors find a positive effect of sports participation on academic outcomes, others report a negative impact. Accordingly, the authors seek to provide a more rounded understanding of these mixed findings. The empirical evidence is provided by a panel dataset of undergraduate students who studied at a Spanish University over the period 2008\u20132014.

Farmer School of Business Administration Date Written: June 22, 2024 Abstract Performance may be motivated by monetary incentives, notions of fairness, or intrinsic motivation. However, empirically testing the role of performance motivators is difficult due to a lack of randomized experiments in the real world. We use novel and granular data of more than 37,000 unique athletes following the change in the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rule to examine the role of monetary incentives. This quasi-natural experiment created a $1 billion market for domestic, but not international student-athletes. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to test whether the increased financial incentive for domestic student athletes led to changes in their performance relative to international students. Results across sports are mixed, but we find important evidence that financial incentives impacted performance, particularly in basketball and hockey.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS Vance Pickard, Ed.D. Ellen Black, Ed.D. CHAIR, GRADUATE STUDIES Scott B. Watson, Ph.D. iii Abstract Athletics and academic performance has been studied at length over the years in the literature. Despite the mostly university level research conducted, no consensus has been reached regarding the impact of athletic participation on academic performance at the high school level. As a result, the relationship between the in season and out of season school academic performance of high school sophomores and juniors in one high school was investigated in this study. It was determined that there was a significant relationship that existed between academic performance, measured by GPA, and athletic participation. Through an analysis of 249 high school sophomore and junior boys and girls, it was found that athletic participation had a positive impact on academic performance and that impact may be attributable to the difference between male in season and out of season performance. iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to thank all of those who have supported my efforts in the accomplishment of this study: \u2022 My advisor, Dr. Clarence Holland, who provided encouragement, assistance and advice during my work. \u2022 My committee members, Dr. Vance Pickard and Dr. Ellen Black, who shared insights, experience and vision which kept me focused throughout the study. \u2022 All of the members of the Rose Tree Media School District who cooperated generously with my many requests during the study.

This paper seeks to determine if participation in collegiate athletics is beneficial to a person or if its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Sixty-seven student-athletes completed a survey during October of 2013 to determine the effects that athletic involvement has had on SDSU\u2019s campus. This study found that participation in athletics is extremely beneficial. These athletes performed better in the classroom, developed impressive time management skills, felt motivated to complete their degree, were motivated to attend classes, and experienced a smoother transition into the college lifestyle.

Previous research describes sports cultures; however, the current study investigated the factors impacting academic motivation and sport motivation. Furthermore, the interrelationship of these two factors was assessed.

This study also provides suggestions to Rowan University on how they can better support their student athlete\u2019s academic success. This research study used surveys and a quantitative data analysis to analyze the grade point averages of the student athletes. The participants in this research study were student athletes that attended Rowan University in the 2021-2022 academic school year and had completed one full academic year. The most significant data collected was that student athletes do not perform better academically in their competitive season. The findings also revealed that female student athletes who participated in a spring sport had the overall better GPA range compared to male student athletes. Recommendations include the suggestion to create mandated study hall hours for all student athletes and the suggestion for individualized tutoring just for student athletes.

If such qualities are transferred into the academic domain, students may also experience academic motivation and success. Many varsity student-athletes are lacking motivation and hard work in the classroom but excel in these categories on the athletic fields. This study of the student-athlete and their motivational levels both in and out of the classroom will provide educators, coaches, and administrators with the knowledge about how to create a positive academic learning environment for its student athletes. The self-expectancy theory by Atkinson, Wigfield, and Eccles (2000) relates motivational levels to expectancies set by individuals. Motivational levels determine the tasks that we choose, persistence during those tasks, how much effort is exerted, and potentially levels of performance. This study examines how athletics influences academic motivation of high s",

Gorman, Ed.D., Committee Chair Michelle J. Barthlow, Ed.D., Committee Member 3 ABSTRACT This quantitative, causal-comparative study was designed to investigate the effect of students\u2019 participation in middle school interscholastic sports on their academic success among urban middle school students. The body of knowledge about the effect of participating in sports on academic achievement is comprehensive at the high school and college levels, but limited research has been done regarding sports participation among middle school students. The participants for this study were drawn from a convenience sample of 366 seventh-grade middle school students in eastern Pennsylvania during the 2018-2019 school year; stratified random sampling was also used to create groups with equal male and female participants. There were 108 student scores used for each research question. The independent variable for both research questions was students\u2019 participation in interscholastic sports programs. The dependent variable for both research questions was the students\u2019 scores on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment for reading and mathematics. The data were archival as student scores on the Pennsylvania System of School Assessment were from the 2018-2019 school year. Differences between the two groups were examined by conducting two independent sample t tests.

This was a turning point in collegiate athletics as multiple lawsuits against the NCAA had been brought by athletes who had competed in the past and were still competing because of the unfairness of \"amateurism.\" (Fresh). After California started the process, the NCAA retracted its regulation, saying that student-athletes may not commercialize their NIL. The Supreme Court added pressure on the NCAA to modify its antiquated practices. While this was a significant advancement in paying players for the time and effort they devote to their sport, it also raised several issues that need more investigation, including how this may affect non-revenue-generating sports. On the surface, this is a fantastic chance for collegiate players. However, because of the disparity in popularity and profitability between sports that generate income and others that do not, student-athletes need to be on a fair playing field to profit from their name, image, or likeness. There will be an even more significant gap between these two categories of university sports when non-revenue-generating sports fall further behind. Although all collegiate athletes have the potential to make money off of their name, image, and likeness, it is unlikely that these athletes could compete on an even playing field, mainly due to gender. Additionally, a new set of guidelines for recruiting strategies and the need to get more powerful athletes have entirely changed how many view college athletics. The consequence of NIL is that sports that produc",

Academics has always been a bedrock principle of intercollegiate athletics, so it is natural to discuss how increased time spent attempting to monetize one\u2019s brand could affect performance in the classroom. Here are the key takeaways from the panel. Academics is inherently built into the NIL equation. According to Don Bruce, a Professor of Economics and Faculty Athletics Representative at the University of Tennessee, a student-athlete\u2019s NIL is maximized when the student-athlete is participating in intercollegiate sport. Obviously, student-athletes must meet certain educational standards to maintain their collegiate athletics eligibility, thus, it follows that academics is still paramount as it relates to NIL so that student-athletes can participate in their respective sports.

The NCAA has recognized these challenges and is working on strategies to support student-athletes in navigating this new landscape.

Using my NIL Research Poll, I recently surveyed over 1,100 college student athletes and high school prospects to get a pulse on how NIL has and has not influenced their lives.\u00a0 Time management: A delicate balancing act The survey results paint a picture of student athletes grappling with the intricacies of time management in the NIL era. Over half (54%) acknowledged that NIL has affected\u00a0the time they dedicate to athletics, academics, and personal pursuits. Notably, a significant 18% strongly agree that they\u2019ve had to make substantial sacrifices and adjustments to their schedules to accommodate NIL activities. This highlights a pressing need for educational institutions and athletic departments to equip student athletes with the tools and strategies necessary to effectively navigate the demands of NIL while upholding their academic and athletic commitments. Financial well-being: A double-edged sword The financial benefits of NIL are undeniable, with a substantial 60% of respondents affirming that it has improved their financial situation. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. Only 24% feel a true sense of financial independence or security. This underscores the importance of financial literacy programs tailored to student athletes. By imparting essential knowledge about budgeting, investing, and long-term financial planning, institutions can empower student athletes to maximize the benefits of NIL while mitigating potential financial pitfalls. Mental health: A spectrum of experiences The survey also delves into the relationship between NIL and mental health. While the majority (56%) of respondents remain neutral or disagree that NIL has negatively affected their mental well-being, 11% strongly agree that it has added stress and pressure to their lives.

Universities are navigating a new environment where college athletes can earn money through endorsements and sponsorships. These changes can lead to increased competition among universities as they seek to attract top talent by offering robust NIL opportunities. The NCAA\u2019s earlier stance on amateurism is facing challenges as various states enact different NIL laws. This legal patchwork can affect how schools approach recruitment and funding. Universities must adapt quickly to ensure compliance while providing attractive packages for their athletes, balancing their own financial constraints with the potential for greater student-athlete engagement.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

It highlights the challenges student-athletes face in balancing academics and sports, referencing previous studies that present mixed findings on whether participation in athletics enhances or hinders academic success. Positive correlations were found between athletic participation and factors like college satisfaction and persistence, while negative outcomes such as stress and lower GPAs were also noted. The study concludes that the relationship between athletics and academic performance is complex and warrants further exploration.

Universities are navigating a new environment where college athletes can earn money through endorsements and sponsorships. These changes can lead to increased competition among universities as they seek to attract top talent by offering robust NIL opportunities. The NCAA\u2019s earlier stance on amateurism is facing challenges as various states enact different NIL laws. This legal patchwork can affect how schools approach recruitment and funding.

That prohibition stood for over a century, but on July 1, 2021, the NCAA introduced new bylaws, allowing for student-athletes to (a) profit from their own NIL through endorsement agreements and business ventures and (b) hire professional representation to facilitate such activity. In turn, high school associations around the country have also begun changing their rules to mirror the NCAA\u2019s new approach, allowing high school athletes to profit from their own NIL as well. These changes, along with new state laws, have opened an estimated $14 billion marketplace. But NIL deals are not one-size-fits-all; traditio",

After years of resisting changes to this rule, the NCAA finally capitulated as several states were poised to implement laws that would allow student athletes to receive NIL benefits. These new laws came about thanks in part to a lawsuit filed by former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon claiming damages from a video game producer who profited from his NIL. With this new era comes tremendous opportunities, challenges and responsibility for student athletes and the schools they play for. Access to NIL opportunities is the first step in a long-awaited process to pay college athletes a share of the revenue generated by mega media deals derived from some, but not all, college sports. Of the more than 30 sports sponsored by the NCAA (USC has 21), only men\u2019s basketball and football turn a profit. These two sports, which typically underwrite athletic department budgets including Olympic sports, are made up of more than 80% young Black men, often from low-income backgrounds. Now that NIL is allowed, several student athletes have landed five- and six-figure endorsement deals, and some choose to use their NIL platforms to leverage community service and social justice initiatives. The challenges associated with NIL include avoiding illegal inducement of potential student athletes and navigating the mental health concerns stemming from managing yet another demand on student athletes\u2019 time and self-image.

But it does not extend to compensation relating to athletic performance, conferences remain free to pass their own rules independently, and universities may decide whether or not to offer any particular benefit. June 22, 2021 Alert The U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in National Collegiate Athletic Association v. Alston\u00a0that, under the antitrust laws, the NCAA may not impose national rules limiting student-athletes from receiving \"education-related\" benefits. The Court's ruling did not extend to student-athlete rules imposed by individual athletic conferences or universities, and the Court recognized that the NCAA still retains considerable leeway about how, and to what extent, such education-related benefits are provided. Student-athletes in Division I FBS football and basketball brought antitrust claims challenging the NCAA's restrictions on compensation in exchange for their athletic services. The district court and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit evaluated these challenges under the \"rule of reason,\" which balances anticompetitive effects and procompetitive benefits to determine the net impact on competition. The courts determined that NCAA rules restricting compensation \"unrelated to education\" (i.e., pay-for-play payments akin to salaries) were reasonable means to preserve ",

The Supreme Court is fairly out of step with American public opinion these days. The conservative justices\u2019 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade last term led to a sizable electoral backlash at the polls against state and federal Republican candidates. Every opinion poll also shows that public esteem for the court has plummeted over the past two years. In one area, however, the justices were ahead of the curve. In the 2021 case NCAA v. Alston, the court unanimously sided with college student-athletes in an antitrust challenge to the college-sports association\u2019s rules against compensating athletes. The ruling itself was somewhat narrow: It only addressed what the lower courts had described as \u201ceducation-related compensation,\u201d which included things like tutoring, internships, postgraduate scholarships, and so on. But the court\u2019s basic application of antitrust laws to the nation\u2019s college-athletics system, as well as its cross-ideological criticism of the status quo where student-athletes generate billions in revenue and receive none of it, was a dismal sign for the NCAA\u2019s hopes at maintaining its hegemony. The American people apparently agree: An August survey by Sportico and the Harris Poll found that 67 percent of Americans support direct compensation for student-athletes. Smaller majorities also favor recognizing student-athletes as employees and allowing them to unionize. The Alston case began as a lawsuit by then current and former student-athletes under the Sherman Antitrust Act. They sought to overturn the NCAA\u2019s restrictions on the amount and kinds of compensation that schools can provide to student-athletes, specifically targeting the men\u2019s football and basketball programs. The broadcast rights alone for those two sports are worth tens of billions of dollars, which goes to the schools, the conferences, the coaches, and",

On June 21, 2021, the United States Supreme Court unanimously found that NCAA rules blanketly prohibiting student-athletes from receiving certain types of compensation violate the federal antitrust laws. The\u00a0Alston\u00a0decision recognizes that the NCAA\u2019s \u201camateurism\u201d rules cannot work to benefit everyone except the student-athletes who produce the product in the first place.\u00a0 Further, the Court left open the question as to how much additional \u201ceducational-related benefits\u201d may exist without violating that bedrock NCAA principle of \u201camateurism.\u201d In this article, we provide an overview of the\u00a0Alston\u00a0case and highlight some of the key issues that colleges and universities\u2014and their athletic departments\u2014need to consider in light of the Court\u2019s decision. On the eve of March Madness 2014, former West Virginia running back Shawne Alston and former University of California center Justine Hartman, as representatives for a class of former men\u2019s and women\u2019s college football and basketball players, commenced an antitrust action against the NCAA. The\u00a0Alston\u00a0plaintiffs alleged that the NCAA\u2019s eligibility rules, which limit the types and amounts of compensation to which student-athletes are entitled, violate Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The Sherman Act prohibits unreasonable restrictions on competition among the states. Courts typically apply a \u201crule of reason\u201d standard of review to sports cases, which consists of a three-part test to determine if the alleged restraint is unreasonable. The plaintiffs first have the burden of showing that the challenged practice unreasonably restrains competition in a relevant market. \u00a0Once the plaintiffs make that showing, the burden shifts to the defendants to show a pro-competitive justification for the practice. The third and final part of the test shifts the burden back to the plaintiffs to show that a less-restrictive alternative (LRA) is available and that the defendants did not employ it.

Introduction Sports law, a multifaceted legal domain, intersects various disciplines including\u00a0contract law, labour law, antitrust law, and intellectual property rights. This legal landscape governs the complex relationships between athletes, teams, leagues, and governing bodies, shaping the very core of organized\u00a0sports.[1] Within this broad spectrum, college sports represent a particularly tricky arena, where the ideals of amateurism clash with the realities of a multi-billion dollar industry of college sports. In the United States, college sports have grown into a cultural phenomenon that goes beyond the boundaries of academic institutions under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Legal precedents have played a big impact in shaping the landscape of college sports. The landmark case of O'Bannon\u00a0v. NCAA(2014)[2]\u00a0fundamentally challenged the core of the NCAA's\u00a0rules which is amateurism. This decision paved the way for significant changes, including the introduction of\u00a0Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) laws, which allow\u00a0student-athletes to profit from their brand.\u00a0 While these legal battles unfold in the United States, other countries are developing their approaches to balancing athlete development with education. In India, the Khelo India initiative, launched in 2018, aims to revitalize\u00a0the sports ecosystem by building a strong\u00a0framework for all sports played in the country.[3]\u00a0Unlike the NCAA's\u00a0commercially driven structure, Khelo India focuses on both athletic and academic growth, providing comprehensive support for young athletes.

Several member institutions asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that the student-athletes failed to allege facts establishing that they were \u201cemployees\u201d under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Specifically, they claimed: student-athletes are amateurs; the Department of Labor (DOL) has determined that interscholastic athletes are not employees under the FLSA; and the student-athletes did not plausibly allege they are employees under a number of multi-factor tests used to determine whether individuals are employees. These arguments relied on decades of court precedent and DOL guidance, each concluding student-athletes were not employees. Despite this guidance, the district court denie",

It has enacted harsh penalties against athletes who violate its policies while profiting off those same athletes through media rights, bowl revenues, ticket sales, royalties and licensing, and donor contributions.[2]\u00a0However, in 2019, California passed the Fair Pay to Play Act, which allows college athletes to be compensated for their NIL and prohibits universities from implementing rules that try to limit the college athlete\u2019s ability to profit off their image.[3]\u00a0The California rule was shortly followed by similar laws enacted in other states nationwide.[4]\u00a0The enactment of the state NIL laws and the Supreme Court ruling in\u00a0NCAA v. Alston\u00a0(2021)\u00a0prompted the NCAA to adopt an interim policy that allows college athletes to engage in NIL activity consistent with the law of the state where the school is located.[5]\u00a0Now, in states nationwide, college athletes can profit from their image through several ways, including endorsements, selling merchandise, and making paid appearances.[6] In this article, I will discuss the NCAA\u2019s history of prohibiting college athletes from profiting off their NIL and how they not only did not compensate athletes but would severely punish the athletes caught breaking the rules. Next, I will discuss the Fair Pay to Play Act and the Supreme Court case\u00a0NCAA v. Alston\u00a0(2021) and how they catalyzed nationwide enactment of NIL laws, which forced the NCAA to reverse all their old policies and now allow Athletes to profit off their image. Finally, I will discuss the current state of NIL and the issues that have been created due to the sudden and drastic change in the law and NCAA policies surrounding NIL.\u00a0 The Dark Ages: College A",

NCAA and the Impact of the Fair Pay to Play Act Feb 28, 2020 By Luke No\u00e9, MS \u00a0 The debate over whether to pay or further compensate collegiate student-athletes has been a growing discussion in recent years, especially given staggering revenue associated with collegiate sport at the highest level. \u00a0 In 2014, the O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA case pushed for increased compensation for these student-athletes related to the use of their likeness, among other things (Webb, 2019). One of the outcomes of this litigation process was the cost-of-living stipend that these players are now able to receive outside of the customary tuition and room and board scholarship. \u00a0 This past November, former Villanova football player Ralph \u201cTrey\u201d Johnson filed a class action lawsuit against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and 22 universities, arguing that student-athletes should be classified as employees and paid, at the very least, minimum wage for the hours in which they participate in their sport (Johnson v. NCAA, 2019). Johnson\u2019s complaint alleges that student-athletes are not paid, even though they are supervised full-time and their total hours are logged, much like the students that work in the ticket office for the football games or those that work in the concession stands. Since work-study programs exist on college campuses, Johnson argues that playing football for the university is no different, and that he and his peers should be rightfully compensated as an employee according to the law. \u00a0 To understand why Johnson is arguing to be classified as an employee, it is important to first examine a landmark bill that was recently signed in the state of California. S.B. 206, commonly referenced as the \u201cFair Play to Pay Act,\u201d opens the door for collegiate athletes in California to be compensated for any use of their name, image or likeness (NIL), sign endorsement deals as long as the sponsorships do not contradict with their school\u2019s contracts, and also sign with an agent, beginning in 2023 (Rizzi, 2019; Young, 20",

The end of amateurism finally comes for college sports. Will we miss it? by Bryan Walsh There are many things that are unique about the United States of America, like our love of guns, really big cars, and archaic systems for electing a president. But one that tends to get overlooked is our love of college sports. And do we ever love them.There are over 520,000 college athletes in the US, playing for nearly 20,000 separate teams in more than 20 different sports. College athletics as a whole produce $13.6 billion in revenue, more than any other professional team sport save the gargantuan NFL, while the nearly 200,000 athletic scholarships given each year are worth the equivalent of some $4 billion. In 43 out of 50 US states, a college coach for a big-time team at a top state university \u2014 a job that can easily pay eight figures \u2014 is that state\u2019s highest-paid public employee. That\u2019s just money.

And all this sits atop an essential contradiction: This entire commercial enterprise, this massive generator of alumni donations and TV rights, is all meant to be amateur. Just athletes playing for the love of the game and maybe a free college education, often struggling to get by or even feed themselves \u2014 even as a single top college football team like the University of Alabama\u2019s Crimson Tide can bring in more than $120 million a year.

The NCAA has settled landmark class action lawsuits totaling $2,800,000,000. These class action lawsuits were initiated by college athletes who claimed they were denied opportunities to earn income from endorsements and media appearances, alleging violations of antitrust laws. The $2.8 billion class action lawsuits alleged that the NCAA and Power Five Conferences violated antitrust laws by conspiring not to pay college athletes for their participation in college sports or for the use of their name, image, and likeness, and by limiting scholarships available to college athletes. The class action lawsuits are known as House v. NCAA, Carter v. NCAA, and Hubbard v. NCAA. The class action settlement resulted due to restrictions college athletes had on their ability to earn money from endorsements and media appearances. The funds from the settlements will compensate eligible athletes for lost opportunities while also ensuring future changes to compensation rules within college athletics in the United States.

The trio of class-action lawsuits challenged various NCAA rules, including a prior ban on student-athletes profiting from their name, image, and likeness (NIL), as well as limits on their pay and benefits. The settlement (if approved by the court) would create a new system where colleges and universities \u2014 for the first time in history \u2014 may pay student-athletes through a revenue-sharing framework. While the settlement, which is in the process of being finalized, has generated considerable excitement among student-athletes, many issues must still be resolved before schools can hand out paychecks. Here are the top three things colleges and universities need to know as you prepare for this sea change. 1. What Happened? The NCAA\u2019s $2.8 billion agreement is set to take effect in the Fall of 2025 and would be funded by the NCAA and Division I institutions. The settlement would provide funds to student-athletes for the years 2017-2020, a period during which athletes were prohibited from earning NIL revenue. Beyond compensating past athletes, the settlement includes a future revenue-sharing model where schools may share a portion of their athletic revenue with athletes.\u00a0Previously, academic scholarships represented the primary form of \u201ccompensation\u201d available to student-athletes.

Getty Images The Supreme Court on Monday ruled unanimously that the National Collegiate Athletic Association may not bar modest payments to athletes. The court upheld a 2019 ruling by a federal district court judge, which in turn was endorsed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit last year. The rulings all concern the Sherman Act, which bars monopolies by organizations in the United States. As they often do, the justices took a measured approach. They chose not to seize a potential opportunity to challenge the NCAA's overall regulations limiting the value of scholarships and other compensation tied to athletic performance, which could have undermined the entire business model of college athletics. But a concurring opinion by Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh suggested that such a reckoning for the NCAA and its financial model is likely ahead -- and that at least he eagerly wants it to be so. The many rich traditions of college sports \"cannot justify the NCAA\u2019s decision to build a massive money-raising enterprise on the backs of student athletes who are not fairly compensated,\" Kavanaugh wrote. \"Nowhere else in America can businesses get away with agreeing not to pay their workers a fair market rate on the theory that their product is defined by not paying their workers a fair market rate. And under ordinary principles of antitrust law, it is not evident why college sports should be any different. The NCAA is not above the law.\" Kavanaugh's line of reasoning may suggest where the court might be heading, but it did not prevail Monday. Instead, Associate Justice Neil M. Gorsuch, writing for the unanimous court, focused his analysis largely on reinforcing the district court's ruling in 2019 and the Ninth Circuit decision last year. \"Some will think the district court did not go far enough,\" Gorsuch wrote. \"By permitting colleges and universities to offer enhanced ",

They can give them cash. That\u2019s about all we know. The rest is uncharted territory. There are many more questions than answers. In House v NCAA, about 14,000 former college athletes enrolled between 2016 and 2020 sued over lost opportunities and profits in the era before 2021. That\u2019s the year that the NCAA changed its rules to permit active student-athletes to make money off their name, image and likeness \u2013 referred to as NIL. The plaintiffs in House argued that they, too, should have been permitted to profit off their NIL and sued for a share of money that schools and leagues made off them. The NCAA is settling the lawsuit by promising to pay $2.75 billion out over the next 10 years. Also, the league will allow the 57 universities that make up the Power Five \u2013 that is, the Atlantic Coast, Big Ten, Big 12, Pacific-12 and Southeastern conferences \u2013 to spend roughly $20 million a year paying student-athletes. As professors of sport management at the University of Michigan, we predict a complicated road of controversy and further litigation ahead.

Judge Claudia Wilken granted preliminary approval to the terms of an industry-changing antitrust settlement Monday morning, accepting a series of changes made by attorneys representing all Division I athletes, the NCAA and its Power Five conferences. Wilken initially raised concerns that some elements of the settlement would limit future payments to players and fail to pass legal muster, but she wrote in her ruling this week that the court \"will likely be able to approve the settlement as fair, reasonable and adequate.\" Wilken's order also established a schedule for the remaining steps to finalize the deal. Any athletes impacted by the settlement will have until Jan. 31 to file objections or opt out. A final hearing to approve the deal is schedule for April 7, 2025 -- coincidentally the same day as the men's basketball championship game. In May, attorneys for all parties agreed to settle a trio of antitrust lawsuits (House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA) that claimed the association's rules are illegally restricting the earning potential of college athletes. The NCAA agreed to pay roughly $2.8 billion in damages to former and current college athletes. The deal also eliminates the restrictions on schools directly paying their players which have long been a cornerstone of the NCAA's amateurism rules. If the settlement is finalized, starting next year schools will be allowed to pay their players up to a certain limit. The cap is expected to start at slightly more than $20 million per school and increase on an annual basis. \"We are thrilled that we are one step closer to a revolutionary change in college sports that will allow NCAA athletes to share in billions of revenue,\" said Steve Berman, co-lead counsel for the plaintiff class.

The Effect of Financial Incentives on Student-Athlete Performance. 38 Pages Posted: 3 Jul 2024 See all articles by Tanja Kirmse Tanja Kirmse Miami University - Farmer School of Business James Flynn Miami University of Ohio - Richard T. Farmer School of Business Administration Date Written: June 22, 2024 Abstract Performance may be motivated by monetary incentives, notions of fairness, or intrinsic motivation. However, empirically testing the role of performance motivators is difficult due to a lack of randomized experiments in the real world. We use novel and granular data of more than 37,000 unique athletes following the change in the NCAA's Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rule to examine the role of monetary incentives. This quasi-natural experiment created a $1 billion market for domestic, but not international student-athletes. We use a difference-in-differences strategy to test whether the increased financial incentive for domestic student athletes led to changes in their performance relative to international students. Results across sports are mixed, but we find important evidence that financial incentives impacted performance, particularly in basketball and hockey.

Student-athletes, who the viewers pay to watch, have historically not received any share of that massive profit. But after a recent surge of litigation and advocacy, it looks like that is about to change, and with it the face of amateur sports. But how? With March Madness in full swing, Harvard Law lecturer and sports law expert Peter Carfagna took to chat with Harvard Law Today about ongoing antitrust litigation involving college athletes; name, image, and likeness (\u201cNIL\u201d) agreements; new transfer portal rules; and the end of amateurism as we know it. The biggest potential loser? According to Carfagna, it is the NCAA, which he predicts may soon be irrelevant. \u201cThe tail,\u201d he says, \u201cis wagging the NCAA dog.\u201d Harvard Law Today: Can we start very basic? What is an antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA? Peter Carfagna: The National Collegiate Athletics Association, or NCAA, is the non-profit sports league that runs college athletics. In professional sports, athletes are compensated for their efforts subject to their contracts with teams and the collectively bargained agreements their player unions agree to with the league. The NCAA is the sole organization in control of college sports and, in the past, has not allowed players to receive payments for their efforts. Meanwhile, the college sports industry is a billion-dollar industry in terms of media rights, advertising, ticket sales, merchandise, etc. Coaches and staff are compensated as professionals and the colleges and the athletic conferences that teams compete in receive substantial amounts of revenue from a variety of sources. Thus, in a vacuum, NCAA rules restricting student athlete compensation are restraints on trade that arguably conflic",

The order also specifically prohibits the NCAA from enforcing its Rule of Restitution, which would have allowed the NCAA to retroactively impose punishment on those breaking the rules if the injunction is later vacated.\u00a0 The NCAA has found itself in another legal battle. As first reported by ESPN\u2019s Pete Thamel, the attorney generals from Tennessee and Virginia have filed an antitrust lawsuit over the enforcement of name, image, and likeness rules regarding the inducement of recruits. Tennessee AG Jonathan Skrmetti claims that the NCAA is breaking federal antitrust laws for their \u201cshifting and opaque series of rules and guidelines\u201d regarding NIL, per Knox News. Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares filed the lawsuit alongside Skrmetti. In November, Miyares was threatening to pursue legal action against the NCAA over the denial of James Madison University\u2019s full bowl eligibility waiver. \u201cThe NCAA\u2019s NIL-recruiting ban violates federal antitrust law, thwarts the free market, and unfairly limits student athletes,\u201d Miyares wrote in a post to X. \u201cWe\u2019re taking them to court.\u201d The lawsuit came one day after news broke that the University of Tennessee was being investigated by the NCAA for potential NIL violations in multiple sports, as first reported by Pat Forde of Sports Illustrated. The NCAA\u2019s investigation into UT is looking at its largest NIL collective, the Spyre Sports Group, according to Thamel. The NCAA\u2019s interim NIL policy that was adopted in 2021 contained a loose guideline of rules and regulations. Combined with varying state laws, entities involved in the NIL space have been able to work around the edges with little transparency. \u201cThis leg",

The injunction is not a final ruling in the case, but the judge's decision will likely have an immediate and dramatic impact on how NIL deals are used in the recruiting process. \"The NCAA's prohibition likely violates federal antitrust law and harms student-athletes,\" U.S. District Judge Clifton Corker wrote in his decision Friday. NCAA rules prohibit student-athletes from signing NIL contracts that are designed as inducements to get them to attend a particular school -- one of the few restrictions in place for how athletes can make money. For example, the NCAA recently announced sanctions against Florida State football because a member of its coaching staff connected a prospect with a booster collective that works closely with the Seminoles. The collective made a specific offer to the player, who was considering transferring from his current school to Florida State. The attorneys general of Tennessee and Virginia argued that the NCAA is illegally restricting opportunities for student-athletes by preventing them from negotiating the terms of NIL deals prior to deciding where they want to go to school. The lawsuit was filed Jan. 31, one day after University of Tennessee chancellor Donde Plowman revealed in a letter to the NCAA that the school's athletic department was being investigated for potential recruiting rules violations. In Friday's ruling, Corker determined that the attorneys general have a reasonable chance of winning their case and that student-athletes could suffer irreparable harm if the restrictions remain in place while the case is being decided. \"Turning upside down rules overwhelmingly supported by member schools will aggravate an alrea",

NIL agreements can impact the academic performance and focus of student-athletes. Balancing athletics with increased financial opportunities requires careful management of their time. Many athletes report that the demands of monetizing their personal brands can lead to more distractions from their studies and sports commitments. The NCAA has recognized these challenges and is working on strategies to support student-athletes in navigating this new landscape.

Exploring the Impact on Athletics and Recruitment Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 18, 2024 College Football The rise of name, image, and likeness (NIL) rights has drastically changed the landscape of college sports. Universities are navigating a new environment where college athletes can earn money through endorsements and sponsorships. These changes can lead to increased competition among universities as they seek to attract top talent by offering robust NIL opportunities. The NCAA\u2019s earlier stance on amateurism is facing challenges as various states enact different NIL laws. This legal patchwork can affect how schools approach recruitment and funding. Universities must adapt quickly to ensure compliance while providing attractive packages for their athletes, balancing their own financial constraints with the potential for greater student-athlete engagement.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

Time Management: A Delicate Balancing Act The survey results paint a picture of student-athletes grappling with time management in the NIL era. Over half (54%) acknowledged that NIL has impacted the time they dedicate to athletics, academics, and personal pursuits. 18% strongly agree that they've had to make substantial sacrifices and adjustments to their schedules to accommodate NIL activities. This highlights a need for universities and high schools to equip student-athletes with the tools and NIL education necessary to effectively navigate the demands of NIL while upholding their academic and athletic commitments. Financial Well-being: A Double-Edged Sword The financial benefits of NIL are undeniable, with 60% of respondents affirming that it has improved their financial situation - to some degree. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. Only 24% feel a true sense of greater financial independence or security. This underscores the importance of financial literacy programs tailored to student-athletes. By educating student-athletes about budgeting, investing, and long-term financial planning, schools can empower student-athletes to maximize the benefits of NIL while mitigating potential financial pitfalls.

College athletics impacts the lives of its athletes, the fans, and the communities surrounding the schools. College athletes' and traditional students' extracurricular activities differ greatly based on a variety of factors, such as the NCAA's rules and regulations. The significant hours and revenues generated by student athletes' extracurricular activities have created the discussion of compensation for student-athletes. There are many ethical arguments in the debate to pay student-athletes, such as the vast pay differences and benefits that coaches receive and the amount of money that universities generate from student-athletes' work. There is also a legal argument in compensating student-athletes based on whether or not a college athlete meets the legal definition of an employee of the university. After analyzing the different ethical and legal issues of the debate, I calculate a revenue- sharing option and a wage option for student-athletes compensation. In order to examine the likely impact that compensation would have at various levels of the NCAA, the schools I analyzed are Ohio State University, the University of Houston, and South Dakota State University, and the sports I used are football, men's and women's basketball, and volleyball. Based on my research, smaller schools' athletics departments would need to make significant changes to their budgets in order to compensate their athletes because their athletics department's net income is negative. There is still more work to be done discussing the ethical and financial implications of paying student-athletes and the impact it would have on ",

Mia R. \u201926 This case study asks the question of whether or not college athletes should be compensated for their contribution to their schools athletic programs? Some key points brought up in the case consist of, the effects that being an athlete has on college students, which individuals are receiving the money brought in by athletes, and the attempts that colleges make to compensate athletes. The case mentions that athletes are being restricted from receiving compensation, however the NCAA receives profits. Although some students receive scholarships, students bring in a lot more money than they receive. When you take these factors into consideration you can use different ethical frameworks to come to an ethical decision. The first ethical framework I used to analyze this case is utilitarianism. When viewing this case from an utilitarian perspective, you would believe that college athletes should be compensated, as well as, the NCAA. A utilitarian should choose the action which benefits the most people overall. By paying athletes they would become more motivated to play, and would perform better. At the same time the NCAA would still receive money. In turn more people would be benefited. The NCAA would be receiving less money if athletes are given salaries,\u00a0 however according to the standard of utilitarianism happiness is defined by the amount of people who are happy and not the amount of happiness one person has. If college athletes did not receive salaries for their time and effort only the NCAA would gain happiness while the athletes would not. Therefore, an utilitarian would believe that college athletes should also receive compensation. I believe that student athletes should be compensated.\u00a0 Compensating student athletes woul",

Every year, fans flood football stadiums to get the quarterback\u2019s autograph and drop hundreds on their favorite player\u2019s basketball jersey at the student store. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) is no exception to this phenomenon. If you go to UNC-Chapel Hill, chances are you have snapped a paparazzi-esque picture of a beloved student-athlete on campus. You\u2019ve probably also seen Armando Bacot\u2019s Carolina-Blue Audi cruising down Franklin Street or Deja Kelly repping \u201cTeam Dunkin\u2019\u201d merchandise on social media following her recent brand deal with the company. Although countless Division I athletes have become household names nationwide, they could not reap a single cent from their likeness until recently. In NCAA v. Alston, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the NCAA could no longer enforce rules restricting certain education-related benefits that its members offered to the student-athletes because those restrictions violated antitrust laws. When Governor Roy Cooper signed an Executive Order following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, North Carolina became the 28th state to allow student-athletes to receive compensation for using their name, image, and likeness (NIL). Effective July 2, 2021, student-athletes in North Carolina could also benefit from NIL deals. The policy change has so far proven to be immensely profitable for universities. UNC-Chapel Hill athletes reportedly earned over $1 million in the first year of NIL. This is a conservative estimate since athletes are not required to document these deals with the athletic department, and only one-half of NIL deals were reported. It is safe to say that NIL is a step in the right direction: athletes can now profit from their brand and pursue entrepreneurial ventures within and beyond ",

Bonani | August 30, 2024 | Entertainment, Sports, & Media Law As the 2024 college football season gets underway, the legal rights and classifications of college athletes are in the midst of a historic and rapid transformation, initiated by a spate of lawsuits starting in 2009 which have primarily challenged the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s (NCAA) (1) restrictions on college athletes\u2019 use and monetization of their name, image, and likeness (NIL), and (2) classification of college athletes as \u201camateurs\u201d who are not eligible to be legally recognized and compensated as \u201cemployees\u201d under state and federal law. In 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court rocked the college sports world with its NCAA v.

This decision ushered in the so-called \u201cNIL era\u201d of college sports and, with it, the escalation of legal challenges to the NCAA\u2019s continuing restrictions on compensation. Recently, there have been separate and groundbreaking legal developments in the two realms of NIL rights and college athlete employment status, which continue to make their way through the legal system. As they do, the NCAA has implemented new NIL rules governing the NIL rights of college athletes and universities. What are the NCAA\u2019s Current NIL Rules? On August 1, 2024, the NCAA implemented their revised NIL rules. The NCAA introduced an NIL platform called NCAA NIL Assist which provides key information to student-athletes seeking NIL deals.

The NCAA continues to attempt to clean up\u00a0NIL\u2019s impact on the\u00a0recruiting trail\u00a0and the\u00a0Transfer Portal. On3 originally reported the NCAA disseminated a memorandum\u00a0that further detailed the standard review for violations related to NIL activities. However, an NCAA spokesperson on Monday told On3 the document was not a new memo to members. It was a \u201csupplement used as a discussion document by the DI Council\u2019s NIL Working Group,\u201d the spokesperson said. In October 2022, at the recommendation of the NIL Working Group, the Division I Board approved and released a new set of clarifications for member schools about how existing NCAA rules \u2013 recruiting, tampering, etc. \u2013 were impacted by the NIL interim policy, laying out in some detail what is and is not allowed.

Each week, semester and year that passes, we see new business ideas, new NIL deals, new ways schools are leveraging NIL to attract and retain student-athletes. There are regular reports and calls for federal NIL legislation and in July, we saw three new proposed bills. As NIL has continued to unfold, so too has the NCAA\u2019s approach to enforcement. Every 6 months or so, the NCAA issues new or updated or clarifying guidance on NIL. In July 2021, the NCAA released their interim policy allowing for student-athletes to benefit from their NIL, while also reiterating that pay-for-play and improper recruiting inducements were still impermissible. As more and more collectives joined the landscape in May of 2022 the NCAA released updated guidelines addressing the role third parties play with NIL and how prospects, student-athletes, and schools can interact with these third parties. The NCAA released a Q&A in July 2022, providing more clarification around the prohibition of institutional involvement with boosters, NIL Collectives and prospective student-athletes. This still left questions regarding institutional involvement with enrolled student-athletes and their NIL activities. The October 2022 guidelines provided guidance on what support institutions can give to their student-athletes as it relates to NIL activities and how institutional staff members can interact with NIL entities. Most recently, on June 27, 2023, the NCAA issued a Q&A to member institutions. In that Q&A, it addressed several questions but two stuck out: Question 1 stated that it is clear institutions may not compensate student-athletes for use of their NIL but asked if it is permissible for an entity closely associated with an institution to do so. The answer was \u201cNo.\u201d The NCAA elaborated that if an entity is so closely aligned with an institution that it is viewed as an extension of the university, it is subject to the same NI",

This finding indicates a systemic vulnerability within college athletics finances. Implementing a profit-sharing model, while potentially beneficial to student-athletes in revenue-generating sports, would likely exacerbate the financial strain on athletic departments. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue-generating sports, as highlighted by Kutak Rock's analysis of the NCAA antitrust settlement, potentially diminishing opportunities for student-athletes and negatively impacting program diversity. While some argue that increased revenue from successful athletic programs could offset these costs, the existing financial instability, coupled with the added expense of profit-sharing, suggests that many departments would struggle to maintain current program offerings, let alone expand them. This financial strain could also lead to increased reliance on institutional subsidies, further diverting resources from other crucial areas of the university."

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

She loves her job, but lately, the financial pressure has been mounting. Sarah\u00e2\u0080\u0099s frustration stems from trying to balance the department's budget amid rising costs. She dreams of increased funding and financial stability, but she constantly fears falling short, unable to secure the necessary resources to keep her programs thriving. Balancing the Budget with Increasing Costs As Sarah walked through the campus, she couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t shake off the anxiety about the department\u00e2\u0080\u0099s finances. The expenses were piling up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 travel costs, facility maintenance, scholarships, and equipment upgrades. Each season brought new challenges, and with the increasing costs, her frustration grew. She spent countless hours in meetings, juggling numbers, and trying to make ends meet without compromising the quality of the athletic programs. Increased Funding and Financial Stability In her heart, Sarah knew what she desired most: a steady stream of funding that would provide financial stability for her department. She envisioned a future where she could invest more in her athletes and coaches, enhance the facilities, and perhaps even introduce new programs. Financial stability would mean fewer sleepless nights and more time focusing on what truly mattered \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the success and well-being of her student-athletes. Failing to Secure Enough Funding However, the fear of not securing enough funding loomed large. Every year, Sarah faced the daunting task of fundraising, seeking donations, and negotiating sponsorships. The unpredictability of these revenue streams kept her on edge. What if they couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t raise enough money? What if a key donor pulled out? The fear of having to cut programs or limit resources for her athletes was a constant shadow.

Financial pressures across higher education are forcing institutional leaders to take actions that had previously been considered untenable. Digging deeper into the revenue makeup and expense drivers of both autonomous and midmajor athletic departments highlights how difficult stabilizing bottom lines will be in the coming years and adds insight into actions over the past year by institutions. The economics of college athletics has been an area of growing significance \u2014 and concern \u2014 at many institutions, where the business model and mission are often distinct from other university operations. One year after March Madness was cancelled, institutional leaders at over 89 colleges and universities have cut over 290 athletic programs in response to the financial pressures of the pandemic. And while the flurry of activity may have subsided for the time being, leaders remain at a crossroads and need to fully understand the economics of college athletics and how the pandemic may reshape them to move forward. Under many resource allocation models, athletic departments are treated as auxiliary units within the university. As such, they are expected to break even financially and rely on...

While popular athletes like Caleb Williams (the 2022 Heisman Winner), Livvy Dunne (11.4M followers on Instagram) and Bronny James (the son of Lebron James) capture much of the public\u2019s attention with their multi-million-dollar valuations and large social media followings, there is less attention directed towards how student athletes can effectively manage their money. Over 520,000 individuals are now able to leverage their campus status for financial compensation and the potential impact on their lives is substantial. However, this newfound source of income at a young age also poses challenges. Within our Workplace Finance Monitor coverage set, most financial wellness providers currently do not offer specific content targeting this student athlete cohort. This creates a void in resources tailored to their unique financial needs and presents an opportunity for providers to address this underserved market. In 2023, Financial Finesse introduced the NIL Long Game, an innovative online financial literacy platform specifically designed for colleges, universities and student athletes. This groundbreaking platform addresses a significant knowledge gap among student athletes, equipping them with the necessary education and guidance to navigate the wealth-building opportunities associated with NIL rights.

They found that \u201cby the NCAA\u2019s benchmark for self-sufficiency, just 24 of the 230 public schools in Division I stand on their own, up from 20 a year earlier, \u201c based on data complied by USA Today Sports in cooperation with Indiana University\u2019s National Sports Journalism Center. Those universities meeting the self-sufficiency benchmark were from the Southeastern, Big Ten, Pac-12, and Big 12 conferences. They noted that the NCAA defines self-sufficiency as \u201coperating revenues \u2013 not counting money from student fees, university funding or direct government support \u2013 at least equal to total operating expenses.\u201d In short, a college athletics department spends less than it takes in to support the athletic program. They also indicate that \u201cthe deficits get smaller and the number of self-sufficient schools gets larger if viewed another way. Though athletic departments get money from student fees, university funds and government support, they also send money to their schools through payments for scholarships and facilities and through transfers\u201d of revenue back to the general university operating budget. When these amounts are reconciled, \u201call 50 of the public schools that were in a Power 5 conference in 2013-2014 were self-sufficient. But only three Bowl Subdivision schools outside the Power 5 and two non-FBS schools were self-sufficient.\u201d To illustrate the growing gap further, NBC Sports also reported last week that SEC schools will likely receive $31 million each for the 2014-2015 fiscal year and that Big 12 universities will get roughly $27 million for their schools with full shares, with slightly less awarded to the newer members.

No sense in pondering certainty. \"Fair to say you wouldn't be here in Paris without \u2026\" \"Definitely,\" he interjects. Evans had just slung a discus 204 feet, 2 inches for Team USA at the Paris Olympics Monday, which wasn't good enough to qualify for Wednesday's medal round. Shortly after, he was asked whether he could've ever made it to the Olympics without the development he got from competing in NCAA sports. It's a no-doubter for Evans. What's more in doubt is the future of NCAA non-revenue sports, which includes track and field, depending on how athletic directors choose to allocate resources. The landmark case of House vs. NCAA is expected to usher in transformative change in college sports in the form of a new revenue sharing model that would be a cash windfall for high-revenue sport athletes, but athletic directors have warned that it could come at the price of discontinuing some non-revenue sports as a cost-saving measure. A settlement agreement in the case has been reached, but hasn't yet been certified by Northern District of California Senior District Judge Claudia Wilken. The settlement could also face legal challenges, but athletic departments in the the Power Four conferences (SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12) are bracing for revenue sharing as a pending reality.

The final approval hearing that would give the green light for the new settlement and its provisions to go into place starting with the 2025-2026 season, is scheduled for April 7, 2025. First, let\u2019s examine the court case and what it involves so we can have a clear understanding of its expected ramifications as well as some insight into why many coaches, staff, and student-athletes are concerned there may be unintended consequences as a result of this ruling. The Court Case The House vs. NCAA settlement, as it is often referred to, is actually a series of cases brought by current and former NCAA players. The House referred to in the name of the settlement is a reference to Grant House, a former collegiate swim competitor from Arizona University. House sued the NCAA in 2020 on the grounds that student-athletes who had been ineligible to receive payment for their name, image, and likeness (NIL) before the July 1, 2021 rule change were owed backpay for money generated using those things.1 The three major components the settlement addresses are: The NCAA has gone through numerous changes over the last several years, including the NIL ruling that was mentioned previously, the introduction of the transfer portal, and major shakeups in conference lineups as teams have been shifted around. But the idea of revenue shifting has track and field coaches around the nation concerned that their slim financing in comparison to high-profile sports like basketball and football could dwindle even further or worse yet, their programs may not survive as schools and the NCAA scramble to collect the funds required to give the mandated retro pay to former student-athletes.1 These concerns are detailed in a joint opinion editorial issued by The U.",

California\u2019s proposed College Athlete Protection (CAP) Act (currently not in effect) proposed using annual reports institutions must make under the Equity in Athletics Disclosure Act (EADA) for both identifying a revenue number and ensuring transparency. The EADA requires institutions to submit an annual report to the federal government about varsity intercollegiate athletics programs and the financial resources and personnel dedicated to those teams.\u00a0 This reporting requirement arose out of concerns that there was insufficient transparency and inequitable spending in college sports well after Title IX was passed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The January 2023 version of the CAP Act defined revenue as the \u201cannual intercollegiate athletics revenue as calculated and ",

Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, navigating right and wrong in a high-stakes business becomes complex. Commercialization and Education Critics argue college sports now resemble professional leagues more than extracurricular activities. Multi-million dollar media rights deals, slick marketing, and lavish facilities conflict with academic ideals. Coaches are the top public employees in many states. However, revenues also provide universities with resources benefiting more than just athletes. The mission should remain educating students above profits. Amateurism and Fairness Controversies frequently erupt around NCAA rules restricting payment to athletes. While generating millions for their programs, players receive no direct compensation. However, athletic scholarships have tremendous value. Relaxing amateurism rules too much risks severing college sports from academics. But not sharing revenues more equitably seems profoundly unfair. Nuance is required in rule-making. Student-Athlete Treatment and Welfare With billions of dollars at stake, student-athlete welfare is often forgotten.

College athletic departments are preparing for U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken to potentially provide final approval of the settlement in the House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA cases, which would allow for direct revenue sharing with athletes later this year. While many administrators have publicly expressed their school\u2019s intent to participate, most have been understandably shy on specifics. After all, the settlement has yet to be approved and athletic departments are preparing to adjust to new roster limits and how the new category of expenses will fit into their reimagined budgets. Using a combination of public comments and publicly available data, as well as insights from the collectives powered by the agency Student Athlete NIL (SANIL), here are potential revenue-sharing models, based on different athletic department profiles. Texas Tech plans to commit \u2018about 74%\u2019 to football players In a rare example of an athletic department publicly sharing its revenue sharing plans, Texas Tech AD Kirby Hocutt and Deputy AD Jonathan Botros shared the school\u2019s plans with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in December. The school projects to share the maximum of roughly $20.5 million with \u201cabout 74% to football players, 17-18% to men\u2019s basketball, 2% to women\u2019s basketball, 1.9% to baseball and smaller percentages to other sports,\u201d according to the Avalanche-Journal.

NCAA settlement represents a seismic shift in the landscape of college athletics. In this article, I appreciate how the author navigates the complex implications of the settlement, shedding light on the winners and losers, even before the final details were solidified in early August. This analysis not only highlights the transformative impact of the $2.8 billion NIL backpay and the introduction of a revenue-sharing framework for athletes but also underscores the far-reaching consequences for non-revenue sports, which might be the biggest losers in this new reality. As athletic departments, particularly those in mid-major programs, grapple with the financial strain of the settlement, these programs face potential cuts, threatening the future of many sports that have long been part of the college athletics fabric.

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball.

A recent NCAA settlement, which allows for revenue sharing of up to $20 million per year with athletes starting in 2025, does not address Title IX compliance specifics, leaving institutions to navigate these decisions independently. Title IX mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must ensure gender equity in sport, which includes equal opportunities, benefits, and financial aid based on sex.\u00a0 Schools must continue to offer equal athletic opportunities without discriminating in the provision of financial aid, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for OCR, wrote in a statement to ESPN. She also emphasized that the principles of Title IX remain unchanged in the new environment, which allows student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness.\u00a0 OCR did not specify whether the new revenue share would be categorized as financial aid, which traditionally requires proportional distribution based on roster spots. This ambiguity forces athletic departments to make potentially contentious decisions such as distributing revenue equally, which could undermine football recruiting competitiveness, or risk legal challenges by favoring male athletes. The lack of federal guidance adds complexity, as schools must avoid gender disparities in benefits and opportunities, regardless of the funding source. Universities are exploring different models, including channeling funds through third parties for endorsement deals, but must ensure these practices comply with Title IX requirements.\u00a0 Schools are awaiting clarity on these regulations, which might only come through future legal rulings or potential legislative action.

Solutions: Cost-Effective Programming: Design programs that maximize the use of existing resources and minimize expenses. Consider utilizing volunteers, partnering with other organizations to share costs, and leveraging technology to streamline operations. Sliding Scale Fees: Implement a sliding scale fee structure to ensure affordability for individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Example: A community recreation center facing budget cuts launched a \u201cSponsor a Child\u201d program, allowing donors to cover the program fees for children from low-income families. This initiative not only addressed the financial challenge but also fostered a sense of community support. Aging Infrastructure and Limited Facilities Many athletics and recreation programs operate in aging facilities with limited space and outdated equipment. This can restrict the types of activities offered, limit participation, and compromise safety. Solutions: Public-Private Partnerships: Explore partnerships with private entities to leverage resources for facility development and maintenance. Creative Space Utilization: Maximize the us",

Perceptions of the Fiscal Challenges Facing Athletic Departments of Historically Black Colleges and Universities Kelly Elliott1 and Timothy Kellison2 1Coastal Carolina University, 2Georgia State University Research has shown the athletic departments of historically black colleges and uni\u00ad versities (HBCUs) do not generate significant revenue. The financial struggle facing HBCU athletic departments can be explained using resource dependency theory. Specifically, as HBCUs are the most under-resourced member institutions of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the numbers demonstrate how these institutions lack sufficient funding to invest in their programs. The purpose of this study is to explore the fiscal challenges facing HBCU athletic departments. To gather this information, two different groups of participants were interviewed to obtain an independent and insider perspective of the challenges. Phenomenology was the methodological approach for this study as each participant had the oppor\u00ad tunity to discuss their unique view of the current financial state of HBCU athletic departments. Participants took part in semi-structured interviews framed around fis\u00ad cal challenges. This study contributes to the growing body of literature addressing HBCU athletics by providing an exploration of current fiscal challenges facing the institutions.

It has created unfortunate layoffs, furloughs, and sport cuts that are impacting many people.

In these extraordinary circumstances, leaders at every school are working earnestly to make the best possible decisions about athletics department finances and overall institutional budgets.\u00a0 \u00a0 At the Power Five level in particular, athletics departments are experiencing annual revenue shortages upwards of $50M \u2013 budget gaps too large to be solved by belt tightening alone. Athletics programs are thus in the process of sorting out financing that will create a way forward.\u00a0 \u00a0 But as schools confront daunting short-term deficits and additional long-term debt obligations, many will also consider eliminating sports to reduce operating costs. Several schools \u2013 including Stanford, Iowa, and Minnesota from the Power Five \u2013 have already taken action.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 COVID-19 has created an unprecedented situation in college athletics, so it is tempting to attribute sport cuts, layoffs, and other financial disruptions solely to its impact. However, closer examination shows that many athletics departments were financially stressed even before effects from the pandemic. Pre-existing structural problems in the broader economic system of college sports created financial challenges for many schools that are now being dramatically amplified by COVID-19. \u00a0 In particular, our economic system has encouraged FBS athletics department spending to rise in unsustainable and imbalanced ways, creating the financial overextensions that put the industry especially at-risk of the unfortunate cuts and other damage we are now experiencing.\u00a0 \u00a0 Different Types Of Sport Cuts \u00a0 Athletics departments cut sports mostly for financial reasons.

Abstract The potential for legal liability involving faculty members and students in higher education settings is a topic that warrants serious attention by administrators. Specific areas identified as high risk include dismissal of a faculty member, denial of tenure, misappropriation of grant-funding, intellectual property conflicts, Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) issues, sexual harassment, student suspension, disabilities, and student privacy issues. Examples of litigation in the higher-education setting are presented, along with a list of online resources for additional information. It is important for higher education administrators, faculty members, staff members, and students to recognize the currently accepted legal rights and responsibilities associated with these high-risk areas.

Where are the NCAA\u2019s ethics and morality in its treatment of student-athletes? Its silence regarding, participation in, and refusal to protect collegiate athletes from sexual abuse and racial discrimination have been evident for decades.[1] The NCAA\u2019s power co",

The NCAA and its Power Five conferences agreed to pay $2.75 billion in damages to college athletes over a 10-year period in a deal that seeks to resolve three pending antitrust lawsuits. The agreement also eliminates NCAA and conference rules that prohibit direct payments from schools to athletes, and allows direct revenue sharing through new payments and benefits, according to a statement from Hagens Berman and Winston & Strawn LLP, the firms representing athlete plaintiffs. The proposed agreement is meant to stave off future antitrust litigation, but player advocates and attorneys say its terms could open the association, conferences, and schools up to more claims that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re unlawfully misclassifying the athletes as students instead of employees under federal labor and wage and hour law. The settlement will still need to be approved by the judge presiding over the three cases. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a seismic shift but is this the end of the road?

That fourth case is set for a hearing Thursday before U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Colorado who is considering the association\u2019s and conferences\u2019 request to have the matter transferred to California, where it likely would be folded into the cases moving toward settlement. Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week. The NCAA Board of Governors also must approve the deal. If the bid to move the fourth case to California is rejected, it could continue in Colorado. If that happens, the NCAA, the conferences and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in the cases seemingly headed toward settlement may have to deal with lawyers who wrote in a filing Tuesday evening that \u201cit seems likely\u201d that one of their plaintiffs \u201cwill opt out of any such settlement t",

It is important for University of California employees to understand what a profit-sharing plan is in the event your employer adopts this contribution method. A profit-sharing plan is a type of qualified defined contribution plan in which the employer contributes to the accounts of participating University of California employees. As the name implies, employer contributions are generally (but not necessarily) tied to the business's profits, allowing employees to 'share' in those profits. Annual contributions to the plan may be discretionary (you need not contribute anything at all), or may be based on a specific formula relating to annual profits. Like other types of qualified plans, the purpose of a profit-sharing plan is to help fund your University of California employees' retirement. By offering such a plan, University of California may be able to attract quality employees and reduce their employee turnover rate. Unlike some other types of qualified plans, however, a pure profit-sharing plan is generally employer-funded. Participating employees generally cannot choose to defer a portion of their pre-tax compensation to the plan (although after-tax employee contributions may be permitted, as discussed below). Tip:\u00a0 The term 'profit-sharing plan' actually describes a broad category that includes several specific types of qualified retirement plans. Employee stock ownership plans and stock bonus plans, 401(k) plans, age-weighted profit-sharing plans, and new comparability plans are all considered profit-sharing plans, although each has its own unique features. Discretionary Vs.\u00a0 Non-discretionary \u00a0Profit-Sharing Plans Under a discretionary profit-sharing plan, the employer can determine the amount to be contributed to the plan each year based on annual profits, fees for plan maintenance, and other factors. They can make contributions to the plan even if they have no current or accumulated profits in a given year. Similarly,",

Typical forms of employee ownership include Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs), where shares are held in a trust for employees, often with tax benefits; direct share purchase plans, where employees buy shares directly, sometimes at a discount; and cooperatives, where each worker holds an equal ownership share and voting rights.

The approach is premised on the notion that companies have 'space' to take a set of key decisions about financial participation. From different angles and experiences in different corners of the world, all contributions show that institutional pressures may be coupled with responses of different actors shaping the form and use of financial participation. The special issue also highlights the importance of future multilevel and mixed methods research to take into account the different institutional forces as well as actors decisions on different levels in shaping the form and use of financial participation.

NCAA settlement and the possible future of revenue sharing in college athletics Duke basketball consistently is the top-earning program in the country. Photo by Amare Swierc | The Chronicle By Ranjan Jindal | @jindal_ranjan May 27, 2024 | 10:08pm EDT Update July 29: The NCAA and power conferences filed long-form settlement documents July 26 to Judge Claudia Wilken of the U.S. District Court for Northern California. This provided more details about the case and its future. For athletes who competed in the pre-NIL era (2016-21), roughly 80-90% of the back pay will go to football and men\u2019s basketball players. Athletes from these two sports will receive an average of $135,000, and women\u2019s basketball players will be paid $35,000 on average. Steve Berman, co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs, said the payments \u2014 which could be as high as $1.8 million \u2014 will be based on how much a player could have made from an NIL deal. The future revenue sharing details are the same, and athletic departments can use up to 22% of their revenue to pay athletes. For the 2025-26 season, that percentage is expected to equal $20-22 million. However, in 10 years, experts believe the figure could rise to $33 million as athletic department revenues steadily increase. The settlement removed scholarship limits for all sports; schools now have roster caps and can decide how many schol",

In his article, Blue described the structural challenges surrounding the growing expenses in big-time college athletics. He noted three economic components that inform athletic directors\u2019 financial decisions: A non-profit organizational structure, zero-sum competition, and accelerating revenue. First, Blue highlighted the non-profit organizational structure of college sport. Athletic departments don\u2019t have owners looking for a return on investment, and thus, sport leaders are not inclined to operate with the goal of turning a profit. With this, economic decisions are informed based on college sport missions, supposedly things like athlete development, gender equity, academic primacy, and long-term sustainability. Financial decisions are also\u2014arguably predominantly\u2014based on winning. Thus, because college sport is a non-profit, when revenues continue to rise, as we\u2019re seeing right now, expenses simultaneously increase in order to achieve the mission(s). Second, Blue discussed college sports\u2019 zero-sum environment: One team or program must win, and thus, another must lose. The competitive and zero-sum design of intercollegiate athletics creates what Blue called \u201can insatiable desire for an athletics program to make investments that drive success in the competitive part of its mission.\u201d The drive to win thus increases departmental expenses. Third, Blue described the trend of accelerating revenues in college athletics, something other non-profit fields do not similarly experience. Once again, since the non-profit mission of college athletics is not to create return on investment or generate surplus revenue, as revenue accelerates, so too do expenses. He concluded these three factors pressurize expenses, increasing departmental spending. And because of the design of ",

But a bipartisan consensus appears to be forming behind measures to hold colleges and universities more accountable for student financial outcomes like loan repayments. Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle have introduced legislative proposals to introduce risk-sharing measures that would hold institutions accountable for student outcomes. The idea is that colleges and universities should have a greater stake in the outcomes of the student borrowers they graduate -- if large numbers of students graduate and are unable to pay back their student debt, their institutions could see access to federal programs restricted. And both the Clinton and Trump campaigns have embraced the concept in their policy platforms. Observers in the policy analyst sector expect Congress to take up the issue once the dust settles from the 2016 elections -- as part of a piecemeal approach to the student debt issue or, more likely, as part of a reauthorization of the Higher Education Act. Policy thinkers say the main question marks beyond the politics of the campaign season and a larger reauthorization bill are what specific metrics colleges and universities would be graded on under such a rating system. Many who have concerns about the idea represent colleges that educate larger numbers of low-income students and feel the institutions will be punished for fulfilling that mission. At the same time, many experts say the federal government needs a tool for holding all colleges and universities accountable for how well they serve their students.

In his article, Blue described the structural challenges surrounding the growing expenses in big-time college athletics. He noted three economic components that inform athletic directors\u2019 financial decisions: A non-profit organizational structure, zero-sum competition, and accelerating revenue. First, Blue highlighted the non-profit organizational structure of college sport. Athletic departments don\u2019t have owners looking for a return on investment, and thus, sport leaders are not inclined to operate with the goal of turning a profit. With this, economic decisions are informed based on college sport missions, supposedly things like athlete development, gender equity, academic primacy, and long-term sustainability. Financial decisions are also\u2014arguably predominantly\u2014based on winning. Thus, because college sport is a non-profit, when revenues continue to rise, as we\u2019re seeing right now, expenses simultaneously increase in order to achieve the mission(s). Second, Blue discussed college sports\u2019 zero-sum environment: One team or program must win, and thus, another must lose. The competitive and zero-sum design of intercollegiate athletics creates what Blue called \u201can insatiable desire for an athletics program to make investments that drive success in the competitive part of its mission.\u201d The drive to win thus increases departmental expenses. Third, Blue described the trend of accelerating revenues in college athletics, something other non-profit fields do not similarly experience. Once again, since the non-profit mission of college athletics is not to create return on investment or generate surplus revenue, as revenue accelerates, so too do expenses. He concluded these three factors pressurize expenses, increasing departmental spending. And because of the design of ",

Profit Sharing Law and Legal Definition Profit sharing is an incentive plan that distributes a portion of an\r organization's profits to its employees. The company contributes a portion\r of its pre-tax profits to a pool that will be distributed among eligible\r employees. The amount distributed to each employee may be weighted by the\r employee's base salary so that employees with higher base salaries receive\r a slightly higher amount of the shared pool of profits. Generally this\r is done on an annual basis. A plan may qualify under federal laws and regulations for tax deductibility\r even if the employer does not have current accumulated profits, provided\r there is a definite formula for allocating plan contributions among participants\r and their beneficiaries for a fixed period, upon the attainment of a stated\r age, or upon an event such as the participant's retirement, disability,\r death or severance of employment.

Their analysis, cited by the Wall Street Journal, reveals that less than half of Power Five athletic departments and even fewer Group of Five departments have built financial reserves.  This finding indicates a systemic vulnerability within college athletics finances. Implementing a profit-sharing model, while potentially beneficial to student-athletes in revenue-generating sports, would likely exacerbate the financial strain on athletic departments. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue-generating sports, as highlighted by Kutak Rock's analysis of the NCAA antitrust settlement, potentially diminishing opportunities for student-athletes and negatively impacting program diversity. While some argue that increased revenue from successful athletic programs could offset these costs, the existing financial instability, coupled with the added expense of profit-sharing, suggests that many departments would struggle to maintain current program offerings, let alone expand them.

Successfully navigating these obstacles is essential to fully reap the benefits of profit sharing. Below, we\u2019ll explore the top four challenges to profit sharing and offer practical solutions to ensure your strategy thrives. 1. Navigating Complexity in Setup and Management Challenge: Setting up a profit-sharing plan involves complex financial calculations, legal compliance, and ongoing administrative management. These tasks can be particularly overwhelming for smaller businesses that lack dedicated HR or financial teams. Solution: Investing in a professional management tool can simplify the setup and administration of your profit-sharing plan. Software like Keepr or similar platforms can automate many of the processes involved, from calculating contributions to managing compliance issues. These tools reduce the administrative burden, allowing you to focus on core business operations while ensuring your profit-sharing plan remains effective and compliant. Furthermore, working with a financial advisor or a consultant with expertise in profit-sharing can help tailor the plan to your company\u2019s specific needs, ensuring that it aligns with both your financial goals and legal obligations. 2. Addressing Potential Inequities Challenge: If not designed carefully, profit-sharing plans can lead to perceptions of unfairness among employees. This issue often arises when employees feel that the distribution formula does not accurately reflect their contributions or efforts, leading to dissatisfaction and potential disengagement. Solution: To mitigate this challenge, it\u2019s crucial to design a transparent and objective distribution formula. The formu",

Several factors contribute to their struggles: These factors have contributed to the closure of several large for-profit chains, such as Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute, and have led to a decline in enrollment in the for-profit sector overall. It\u2019s important to note that not all for-profit institutions are the same. Some provide valuable education and positive outcomes for their students. However, the issues mentioned above highlight systemic challenges within the for-profit higher education sector.

The Challenge Institutions of higher education (IHEs) face a complex set of financial, technological, political, social and demographic challenges that have intensified significantly over the last decade. Traditional focus on revenue generation has failed to address the fundamental need many institutions of higher education have to transform their educational and business models in ways that can help drive student success and social mobility, especially for students of color, students from low-income families, and other underserved populations. Colleges collectively enrolled about 560,000 fewer undergraduates\u00a0in the fall of 2020, a 3.6 percent decrease from 2019. The losses were much steeper at community colleges and among first-time students. Collective Enrollment (-560,200 students) As one response, institutions are increasingly open to exploring partnerships of various kinds, including: mergers (full or partial); early, well-planned and well-funded teach-outs; sharing of facilities and infrastructure, co-curricular offerings and student services; and business/administrative consolidations. Most college and university leaders, however, have limited experience in this realm. Partnership explorations are particularly challenging in higher education, given the competitive market, the importance of shared governance, the role of alumni, the centrality of location and facilities, and the complex regulatory framework within which they operate. Despite these challenges, partnerships may be essential for some IHEs (particularly those at risk of faltering or failing to provide adequate instruction and support) to remain strong and fulfill their promises to students. In such instances, successful partnerships can help the institutions better serve students by becoming more efficient, effective, and stable.

The cost of providing higher education continues to rise with fewer\u00a0students either able or willing to pay the price. Competition among institutions for\u00a0students has increased especially between public and private institutions; this is\u00a0exacerbated by the demographic changes in the country whereby the number of\u00a0high school graduates has decreased in most of the country and will not increase\u00a0again until 2024.

Although his prediction has not yet come true, he was directionally right. More than 120 colleges have closed since 2016. Some were for-profit institutions, but many were non-profits. Branch campuses have closed in Wisconsin and other states as universities seek to adjust to financial and enrollment realities. Mergers of public institutions have been bruited by governors in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma, and South Carolina this year, and a legislator in Mississippi is calling for the closure of three of that state\u2019s public colleges and universities.\u00a0 George Pernsteiner College enrollment in the United States peaked nearly 15 years ago and now stands at 90% of its former high. Demographic trends suggest a coming steep decline in the number of Americans aged 18-24, the traditional sweet spot for college enrollment. Large, well-known universities, seeing this trend, have stepped up recruiting and many are at or near the highest enrollment levels in their history. This has left smaller and less known institutions staring at the results of double-digit enrollment declines. Many have turned to steep tuition discounting to build their classes, often realizing less than half the sticker price in net tuition revenue.\u00a0 Many have pointed to the 40 million adults who started college but left without earning a degree. Might they not be the source of students to keep college enrollment robust? They already have shown an interest in college, so why not lure them back? But the re",

To address the issues of ever-changing business environments and to deliver value propositions, PHEI should focus on their intangible assets to increase their capabilities to achieve frugal open innovation. The objective of this paper is to investigate the challenges faced by private universities from the practitioners\u2019 points of view and offer a practical solution. This paper also attempts to identify whether there is a need for any changes in business model or operations required by private universities to sustain their competitive advantage in the current environment. This study is exploratory in nature due to scarcity of past literature on frugal open innovation in PHEI context. Interviews were conducted with experienced practitioners to elicit their experience managing challenges in PHEI. As a result, this paper sheds light on the ability of PHEI to formalize, capture, and leverage its intangible assets rather than only investing and managing tangible assets in order to achieve frugal open innovation. Frugal open innovation is the enabler for PHEI to focus on core functions, create closer integration with industry, local and international communities and promote greater efficiency in operations. This paper is novel because it seeks to contribute to the current debate in the literatur",

Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, higher-education operating models were under tremendous pressure. Many institutions, experiencing declining enrollment, watched expenses outpace revenues and tapped into their endowments to cover shortfalls. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the pressures that higher-education institutions face. Even some of the most notable and stable institutions are experiencing significant declines in tuition and auxiliary revenues as well as increasing budget shortfalls. Our analysis suggests\u00c2\u00a0that, before any government or philanthropic intervention, up to 57 percent of public four-year institutions and up to 77 percent of private not-for-profit four-year institutions could suffer budgetary shortfalls of more than 5 percent. The more than $35 billion provided by the federal government to higher education in relief acts to date has helped institutions and students address some of the near-term challenges, but the enrollment headwinds will likely affect university budgets for years to come.1Relief included about $14 billion in the March CARES Act and about $23 billion in the December Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021.

Meanwhile, median tuition discount rates at private colleges rose by more than 5 percentage points, to 44.4%, in that period, putting pressure on college revenues.\u00a0 From 2019 through the second quarter of 2024, the ratings agency issued 126 credit downgrades for the higher ed sector, compared to 62 upgrades, per the report.

Top-ranked schools turn away throngs of top applicants, while cushioned by staggering endowments. Others, including many small liberal arts colleges, are facing declining enrollment, nervously watching expenses outpace revenue, and tapping their endowments to cover shortfalls. These pressures have forced many schools to make painful choices, including cutting programs, laying off faculty, merging with other schools, and reducing student admissions. In the worst cases, some schools have lost accreditation or have shut down. There will likely be more: our review of public data suggests that at least 90 medium-size not-for-profit institutions across the country show some signs of financial pressure. This snapshot may even understate the problem. Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s recently predicted that growth in operating expenses will outpace revenues at most institutions of higher education. To be financially stable, most colleges need revenue growth of at least 3 percent, Moody\u00e2\u0080\u0099s advised. Just 44 percent of chief financial officers of higher education institutions say they are confident their college will be financially stable over the next 10 years, down from 54 percent in 2016, according to a survey last year by Inside Higher Ed. Among the many reasons: more than two-thirds believe that their tuition discount rate is unsustainable. At the same time, many students feel burdened by their educational debt, which suggests that schools can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t continue to rely so heavily on conventional tuition as a sustainable revenue source. Americans collectively owe nearly $1.57 trillion in student debt, according to the Federal Reserve, which is a 27 percent jump since 2014.

Abstract This study investigates the relationship between university financial resources, applied accounting systems, and the place of a university in the Shanghai Ranking. We find a strong relationship between the financial resources under the control of a world-class university and the position of that university in the highest tier of the global ranking. We propose a model (available online) to predict a university's tier in the ranking through the financial resources it employs. A critical condition for making a university a world-class university could be to provide it with a sufficiently high level of financial resources, and its efficiency could play an important leverage role. In view of the results, policymakers are challenged with a drastic choice: to increase international competition among universities, it is necessary to concentrate a huge amount of resources on a few universities that are already in the ranking. In contrast, the policy of the proportional distribution of resources does not affect international competition and may be inefficient. Furthermore, financ",

AccountingInsights Team Published Aug 9, 2024 A 50/50 profit sharing agreement is a pivotal tool for partners looking to equitably distribute the financial outcomes of their joint venture. This type of arrangement not only underscores a commitment to shared success but also necessitates meticulous planning and clear communication to function effectively. Understanding how to structure such an agreement properly can prevent potential conflicts and ensure that all parties feel fairly treated as they contribute to the growth of the business. As businesses increasingly look towards collaborative ventures, the relevance of crafting a balanced and transparent profit-sharing agreement becomes more pronounced. Key Elements of a 50/50 Profit Sharing Agreement When embarking on a partnership that involves a 50/50 profit sharing agreement, it is imperative to define the scope and nature of the agreement comprehensively. One of the primary elements to consider is the definition of profits. Partners must agree on what constitutes profit for the purposes of distribution. This typically involves specifying whether the profit refers to gross or net earnings. Clarity in this aspect helps in setting realistic expectations and in the calculation of shares that each party is entitled to. Another significant element is the duration of the agreement. Partners should specify whether the profit sharing arrangement is for a fixed term or indefinite. This decision impacts long-term business planning and ope",

It ensures transparency and fairness in distributing profits, losses, and liabilities according to the partnership agreement. Comprehensive Definition Introduction Partnership accounting plays a critical role in managing the financial aspects of a business owned by two or more partners. It involves the systematic recording of each partner\u2019s contributions, distributions, profit shares, and responsibilities. This form of accounting helps ensure that financial transparency is maintained, fostering trust and minimizing disputes among partners. Unlike sole proprietorships or corporations, partnerships have unique accounting needs driven by the division of profits, liabilities, and decision-making responsibilities. Accurate partnership accounting is essential for tracking individual capital accounts, calculating partner withdrawals, and reflecting each partner\u2019s equity in the business. Understanding these processes is vital for maintaining healthy financial relationships between partners and ensuring compliance with tax regulations. Key Points Partnership accounting involves several key elements that distinguish it from other forms of business accounting: Benefits Effective partnership accounting provides several benefits that contribute to smooth business operations and financial clarity: Challenges Despite its importance, partnership accounting presents several challenges: Future Trends As businesses evolve, partnership accounting continues to adapt to new trends and technologies: Best Practices Conclusion Partnership accounting is essential for the smooth operation of any business involving multiple partners.

ABSTRACT The system of private universities in Vietnam has been formed and made remarkable progress for over 30 years, since the 1986 Renovation. At the present time, there are 65 private universities, of which the majority is of non-profit private universities, accounting for about 27,4% of the total number of higher education institutions across the country. However, in the process of organization and operation of this type, there exist many inadequacies and internal disputes related to issues such as capital contribution, ownership and benefit sharing or disputes over the senior management positions. This situation raises the question of whether the current laws and regulations on non-profit private university governance is really appropriate and encourages them to develop. To answer these questions, the article will explore and analyze the relevant laws and regulations on private higher education, and then point out the limitations. Thereby, make some suggestions to improve the laws on the governance of non-profit private university in Vietnam. Keywords Higher Education, Private University, Non-profit Private University, Governance, Vietnam. Introduction Higher education is one of the pillars of socio-economic development of each country (Batterbury and Hill, 2014).

Implementation obstacles and strategy implementation failure Abstract Purpose \u2013 The paper addresses the following question: How do strategy implementation obstacles relate to each other and affect strategy implementation? Method \u2013 The research methodology is qualitative and based on an extensive review of the literature and on an in-depth case study analysis. Findings \u2013 This paper draws two main conclusions. The first is that the many obstacles that impact the strategy implementation process can interact and be strongly interrelated in dynamic and complex manners. The second is that obstacles can lead to and reinforce other obstacles, eventually forming long chains of blockages. Originality \u2013 Strategy implementation remains a difficult task with improbable success. This paper provides a contribution to an explanation on why so many strategy implementation efforts fail. It is one of the very few papers addressing the issue of the relationships between strategy implementation obstacles.

A balanced budget where expenditures remain within available revenues is always expected of a financially responsible college or university. A major reduction in the net assets of an institution should be cause for concern and may be a sign of financial instability. Revenue and Assets The primary sources of revenue vary depending on whether an institution is public or private. Most private institutions depend heavily on student tuition as the major source of revenue, while public institutions receive a mixture of state appropriations and student tuition. The portion of the budget that comes from state appropriations may vary from state to state depending on the policy position of each state as to the percentage of the budget that tuition is expected to support. According to 1996\u20131997 data from the National Center for Education Statistics, fund revenues for public institutions came from four primary sources: tuition and fees (19%), federal funds (11%), state funds (36%), and sales and services (22%). Private institutions also received the majority of total revenues from these four sources but had different percentages in each category: tuition and fees (43%), federal funds (14%), state funds (2%), and sales and services (21%).

This accounting tool is not just a list of departments and accounts; it's a structured framework that enables institutions to manage their financial operations and reporting effectively. A well-designed COA structure is especially critical in large, research-intensive (R1/R2) universities where the scale and diversity of operations\u2014from research grants to multiple campuses\u2014demand a high level of financial granularity and control. The COA's role extends beyond basic bookkeeping. It facilitates a wide range of financial management activities, including but not limited to, expense tracking, revenue recognition, asset management, and liabilities. Moreover, it plays a pivotal role in generating key financial statements, aiding in budgetary controls, and ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements. In R1/R2 universities, the COA must be designed to accommodate a multitude of needs: it must be flexible enough to adapt to changing organizational structures yet robust enough to meet stringent reporting and compliance standards. It also needs to integrate and function seamlessly with advanced Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, like Oracle Cloud Student, which offers automation and real-time analytics. The Chart of Accounts (COA) serves as the backbone of any financial system, providing a structured view of an organization's financial transactions. For higher education institutions, which often have diverse and complex operations, designing an effective COA structure is crucial. This white paper aims to delve into the various functionalities and considerations for designing an effective COA in higher education settings. The Role of COA in Transactions, Reporting and Analysis Before diving into the design considerations, it's essential to understand how COA is used in the day-to-day financial operatio",

A balanced budget where expenditures remain within available revenues is always expected of a financially responsible college or university. A major reduction in the net assets of an institution should be cause for concern and may be a sign of financial instability. Revenue and Assets The primary sources of revenue vary depending on whether an institution is public or private. Most private institutions depend heavily on student tuition as the major source of revenue, while public institutions receive a mixture of state appropriations and student tuition. The portion of the budget that comes from state appropriations may vary from state to state depending on the policy position of each state as to the percentage of the budget that tuition is expected to support. According to 1996\u20131997 data from the National Center for Education Statistics, fund revenues for public institutions came from four primary sources: tuition and fees (19%), federal funds (11%), state funds (36%), and sales and services (22%). Private institutions also received the majority of total revenues from these four sources but had different percentages in each category: tuition and fees (43%), federal funds (14%), state funds (2%), and sales and services (21%). As noted, state appropriations are particularly important to public institutions and, in fact, represent the majority of revenues available to the overall higher education enterprise. In the academic year 1995\u20131996, direct general expenditures of state and local governments for postsecondary education totaled $100.7 billion. Of this total, $89.7 billion were appropriated for educat",

The investigation also examines the impact of formal and informal education on financial performance, positing that practical training yields greater financial improvement than theoretical schooling. This research examines 234 MSMEs using structural equation modeling (SEM) with SmartPLS and employs path analysis to investigate the impact of sharing economy platforms on MAS, as well as its consequences for financial performance. The results indicate that sharing economy platforms and MAS have a significant effect on financial performance. Informal education has a significant effect on sharing economy platforms and MAS, whereas formal education has a negative effect on financial performance. Demographic factors were observed to have a significant moderating effect on the path from MAS to financial performance. This study introduces the Adaptive Financial Capability Model (AFCM), a novel framework that uniquely integrates adaptive learning derived from informal education with demographic factors.

Education used to be considered a public good, provided by nonprofit organizations that were unexposed to market pressure and had clear societal missions. Now, education is becoming a global service delivered by quasi-companies in an ever-more complex and competitive knowledge marketplace. To cope with these challenges, higher education institutions need an appropriate strategy, a necessity reflected in numerous calls for research on strategy in the higher education sector. This article's purpose is to contribute to this discussion by providing prescriptive guidance to higher education managers and policy makers. To this end, it proposes a SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) analysis illustrating eight key trends that will impact higher education and academia in the short-to-medium term. Drawing from these trends, three core challenges are identified that higher education institutions will face and that have fundamental implications for research and practice: (1) the need to enhance prestige and market share; (2) the need to embrace an entrepreneurial mindset; and (3) the need to expand interactions and value co-creation with key stakeholders.

(7 pages) Higher-education institutions in the United States are facing unprecedented challenges. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, higher-education operating models were under tremendous pressure. Many institutions, experiencing declining enrollment, watched expenses outpace revenues and tapped into their endowments to cover shortfalls. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the pressures that higher-education institutions face. Even some of the most notable and stable institutions are experiencing significant declines in tuition and auxiliary revenues as well as increasing budget shortfalls. Our analysis suggests\u00a0that, before any government or philanthropic intervention, up to 57 percent of public four-year institutions and up to 77 percent of private not-for-profit four-year institutions could suffer budgetary shortfalls of more than 5 percent. The more than $35 billion provided by the federal government to higher education in relief acts to date has helped institutions and students address some of the near-term challenges, but the enrollment headwinds will likely affect university budgets for years to come.1Relief included about $14 billion in the March CARES Act and about $23 billion in the December Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021.

College And University leaders, along with their board members, are working to confront a variety of financial challenges, many of which predate the pandemic. These issues\u2014including rising demand for financial aid, student health and wellness needs, demographic changes, cultural polarization, increased workforce demands, and (most recently) inflation\u2014have boards and institutional leaders feeling more pressure than ever. In a recent survey by the Association of Governing Boards of Universities and Colleges (AGB), trustees noted that increased scrutiny by the campus community, the media, and the public, as well as increasing levels of transparency, have added to the increased complexity of their roles. While financial pressures existed before the COVID-19 pandemic, the past two years have accelerated the need to address these issues at many colleges and universities, pressuring institutional leaders and trustees to act quickly, without optimal time and structures to think or plan more strategically. What do we need to do to build or sustain long-term strength and viability, while also further investing in and promoting distinct value propositions in this new landscape?

Every year, fans flood football stadiums to get the quarterback\u2019s autograph and drop hundreds on their favorite player\u2019s basketball jersey at the student store. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-Chapel Hill) is no exception to this phenomenon. If you go to UNC-Chapel Hill, chances are you have snapped a paparazzi-esque picture of a beloved student-athlete on campus. You\u2019ve probably also seen Armando Bacot\u2019s Carolina-Blue Audi cruising down Franklin Street or Deja Kelly repping \u201cTeam Dunkin\u2019\u201d merchandise on social media following her recent brand deal with the company. Although countless Division I athletes have become household names nationwide, they could not reap a single cent from their likeness until recently. In NCAA v. Alston, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the NCAA could no longer enforce rules restricting certain education-related benefits that its members offered to the student-athletes because those restrictions violated antitrust laws. When Governor Roy Cooper signed an Executive Order following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, North Carolina became the 28th state to allow student-athletes to receive compensation for using their name, image, and likeness (NIL). Effective July 2, 2021, student-athletes in North Carolina could also benefit from NIL deals. The policy change has so far proven to be immensely profitable for universities. UNC-Chapel Hill athletes reportedly earned over $1 million in the first year of NIL. This is a conservative estimate since athletes are not required to document these deals with the athletic department, and only one-half of NIL deals were reported. It is safe to say that NIL is a step in the right direction: athletes can now profit from their brand and pursue entrepreneurial ventures within and beyond ",

Hey! Curious to hear some thoughts on why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I'd like to consider different perspectives to form my own opinion. Thanks! 11 months ago Hello! It's important to consider various perspectives when thinking about whether college athletes should be paid or not. Here are a few common arguments against paying college athletes: 1. Amateurism: One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is preserving the spirit of amateurism in college sports. This means that student-athletes participate in sports for the love and passion they have for the game, not for financial gain. Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

The debate has been ongoing, with strong arguments on both sides. In this essay, we will examine why college athletes should not be paid, covering various reasons such as the potential for budget cuts, concerns about amateurism, unfairness among athletes, educational compromise, and the slippery slope effect. Through a critical analysis of these arguments, we will demonstrate why paying college athletes could have detrimental consequences. It could lead to budget cuts One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is that it could lead to budget cuts for other academic and athletic programs at universities. College sports programs already require significant funding, and paying athletes would require even more money, potentially putting a strain on university budgets. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that universities may be forced to cut funding for other programs, such as academic departments or other athletic teams, in order to pay for athlete compensation. In some cases, universities may even be forced to cut the size of their sports programs altogether, eliminating opportunities for athletes to participate in college sports. In addition, it is argued that paying college athletes could also lead to a disparity between larger and smaller schools, with the larger and more profitable schools having an advantage in recruiting athletes. This could create an even greater imbalance in college ",

By CLRN team / December 25, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not be Paid: A Case for a Fair and Ethical System The debate surrounding the issue of paying college athletes has been ongoing for years, with many arguing that these athletes deserve to be compensated for their talents and hard work. However, there are several reasons why college athletes should not be paid, and in this article, we will explore these arguments in depth. The Main Argument: Balance and Fairness The main argument against paying college athletes is that it would create an unfair and unbalanced system. Athletes who play for top-tier colleges and universities already receive a top-notch \u00a0education, access to top-notch facilities, and access to top-notch training and coaching. If they were to receive a salary, it would put those who attend smaller colleges and universities at a significant disadvantage. It would be unfair to expect those institutions to match the salaries of larger schools, and it would ultimately lead to a system where only the wealthiest institutions could attract the best talent. The Problem of Professionalization Paying college athletes would also professionalize the sport, which would have far-reaching consequences. College sports are meant to be a part of the \u00a0educational experience, a way for students to develop important skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management. If athletes are paid, it would create a situation where the primary focus is on the game, rather than on the education. This would be a disservice to the athletes, who would be going to college to learn and develop as individuals, rather than as professionals. The Issue of Amateurism vs. Professionalism Another issue is the concept of amateurism. The NCAA is a governing body that regulates col",

Paying them would acknowledge their contribution to these profits. Equity and Fairness: Many college athletes come from low-income backgrounds and face financial hardships while dedicating significant time to their sports. Compensation can help address these inequities, allowing them to focus on both academics and athletics without financial stress\u200b.

There are several reasons given in support for both sides. Some rationales supporting the payment of student athletes include college athletes expenditure of time towards their sport\u2014an average of 43.3 hours per week, college athletes struggle to make ends meet, paying students would only make the sport more competitive, the money earned from athletics is not automatically reinvested in education and research, the college sports apparel market capitalizes specifically on these players, payment would help athletes leave school with a degree and little debt, and the NCAA is an $11 billion industry which should be able to afford paying people on all levels, including the players.. \u00a0 Common arguments against the payment of student athletes encompass a lack of college athletic programs to \u00a0afford to pay athletes, elite college athletes receive athletic scholarships which serves as a form of compensation, there is no fair way to pay college athletes, students are not professionals, paying student athletes will cause cuts elsewhere, and paying college athletes will ruin college sports. \u00a0 One of the major arguments used by the NCAA is the preservation of its amateurism model and the fact that the players are student-athletes. According to the NCAA, an amateur is a person that \u201cdoes not have a written or verbal agreement with an agent, has not profited above his/her actual and necessary expenses or gained a competitive advantage in his/her sport.\u201d There has been pushback and litigation against the NCAA and its resistance to pay student athletes. Ed O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA was an antitrust lawsuit case in 2014 against the NCAA over the commercialized use of players\u2019 names, images and likeness. In the lawsuit, U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken shot down amateurism as an appropriate defense for the NCAA not to all",

Based on insights from Mark McCareins Michael Meier Based on insights from Mark McCareins Summary The proposed settlement to the class-action lawsuit House vs. NCAA stands to fundamentally change major college sports by introducing direct payments to players in football and basketball from the schools\u2019 broadcast revenues. This will have an impact on how name, image, and likeness contracts are handled, how schools handle equity measures via Title IX reporting, and how athletes and schools approach unionization efforts by athletes.... more less There has long been a debate over whether college athletes\u2014who can generate millions of dollars for their universities\u2014should get paid. A major turning point in that debate occurred in early 2024, when the NCAA agreed to a proposed settlement in a class-action suit, commonly referred to as House vs. NCAA, which paves the way for schools to start sharing broadcast revenue with players. The settlement, which applies to the five biggest collegiate conferences, still needs to be approved by the judge\u2014who has already asked the parties to revisit parts of the deal. But in broad terms, it allows for back pay for players from 2016 on and stipulates that going forward, players will get a significant share of the broadcast-revenue pot. One matter to be settled is whether payments to athletes by groups of boosters will be allowed\u2014and if s",

The new NCAA rule allows for direct payment to student-athletes, marking a shift from traditional amateurism. This introduces a new era where athletes can be compensated for their contributions, addressing ongoing debates about fairness and equity in sports. With the NCAA\u2019s push to amend its rules, student-athletes can now benefit from their names, images, and likenesses (NIL) in ways previously prohibited. This is a crucial development for those who compete in high-revenue sports like college football and men\u2019s college basketball. The decision directly affects how universities approach recruitment and athlete support, paving the way for a more equitable system.

According to Don Bruce, a Professor of Economics and Faculty Athletics Representative at the University of Tennessee, a student-athlete\u2019s NIL is maximized when the student-athlete is participating in intercollegiate sport.

Over half (54%) acknowledged that NIL has affected\u00a0the time they dedicate to athletics, academics, and personal pursuits. Notably, a significant 18% strongly agree that they\u2019ve had to make substantial sacrifices and adjustments to their schedules to accommodate NIL activities.

However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. Only 24% feel a true sense of financial independence or security.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

Despite many strong opinions being present on the subject, far less critical literature that actually scientifically examines pertinent data to the equation exists. In an effort to examine the academic performance of student athletes versus non student athletes, this work will draw from peer reviewed literature to analyze findings related to the study. As a result of the multitasking and commitment required for athletic endeavors, it was hypothesized by the researcher that students who participate in organized sports would have higher GPA\u2019s than those who did not. Based on the literature collected, however, this perspective proved to be erroneous. In all of the studies examined, there was no direct relationship between sports and higher GPA\u2019s. In some instances, participation in sports was equitable to lower academic performance. Though some sources suggested that positive skills relevant to the workforce could be gained through organized sport participation, student athletes tended to have more stress, lower academic performance and more problems with socialization than their non athletic counterparts. Academic Performance According to Rensburg, Surujlal and Dhurup (2011), \u201cUniversity student athletes, constitution of the primary clients of the university, and are regarded as the heart and soul of every educational institution\u201d (p. 248).

This paper seeks to determine if participation in collegiate athletics is beneficial to a person or if its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Sixty-seven student-athletes completed a survey during October of 2013 to determine the effects that athletic involvement has had on SDSU\u2019s campus. This study found that participation in athletics is extremely beneficial. These athletes performed better in the classroom, developed impressive time management skills, felt motivated to complete their degree, were motivated to attend classes, and experienced a smoother transition into the college lifestyle.

Analyses of information collected through online surveys (N= 151) and in-person interviews (N=8) suggest that both non-revenue athletes and revenue athletes value their academics more than athletics. However, comparisons of the two groups indicate that non-revenue athletes value their academics slightly more than do revenue athletes. Revenue athletes struggle with short-term academic goals, such as studying outside of class and turning academic coursework in before the deadline. These findings suggest the need for more effective support policies to help revenue athletes devote more time to their academic courses.

However, research shows that participating in sports can have a positive impact on a student's academic performance. The Benefits of Sports on Academic Performance: Inspiring Stories Enhanced Cognitive Abilities Regular physical activity has a direct correlation with enhanced cognitive abilities. Numerous studies have proven that engaging in sports can improve memory, attention span, decision-making skills, and problem-solving abilities. By participating in sports, students learn to strategize, analyze situations quickly, and make split-second decisions, which also helps them excel in their academic pursuits. Participating in sports can enhance cognitive skills such as memory, attention span, decision-making, and problem-solving abilities, leading to improved academic performance. Improved Time Management Sports require commitment, discipline, and time management. Student-athletes often face the challenge of balancing their sports training, games, and academic responsibilities. To excel in their chosen sport while maintaining their academic performance, they must learn effective time management techniques. These skills transfer to their academic life, allowing them to prioritize tasks, meet deadlines, and maintain a well-structured study routine. Sports help students develop effective time management skills that can be applied to their academic life, leading to better organization and improved academic performance. Enhanced Focus and Concentration Sports require athletes to focus and concentrate on the game at hand. This translates into their academic life, helping them stay focused during classes, lectures, and study se",

Striking this balance is essential, not only for short-term success but also for long-term growth. In this article, The Wire explores why finding harmony between the classroom and the field is crucial, discuss effective strategies for achieving this balance, and provides scenarios for analysis. The Significance of Academic-Athletic Balance Understanding why balancing academics and athletics is important to a student athlete sets the foundation for success in both realms: Recruitment Opportunities: College recruiters seek more than just talent; they look for well-rounded individuals who excel academically. A strong academic profile can open doors to a wider range of colleges and scholarship opportunities. Life Beyond Sports: While athletics are exhilarating, education provides a foundation for personal and professional growth, offering opportunities far beyond one\u2019s athletic career. Effective Strategies for Balance Here are five overarching strategies that can help student-athletes navigate the dual challenges of academics and athletics: Time Management: Develop strong time management skills. Create a structured daily schedule that includes dedicated blocks of time for both academics and athletics. Allocate time for study sessions, practice, and essential downtime.

Although existing studies have focused on the adverse effects of this conflict on the well-being of college athletes, they have not yet determined the underlying mechanism and effective measures to alleviate it. To explore the underlying mechanism of academics\u2013athletics conflict, which affects the well-being of college athletes, we constructed a moderated mediating model to examine the critical role of negative emotions and life motivation in the relationship between them. The study randomly selected 802 college athletes from China to examine the relationships between academics\u2013athletics conflict, negative emotions, eudaimonic motives, hedonic motives, and life satisfaction.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS Vance Pickard, Ed.D. Ellen Black, Ed.D. CHAIR, GRADUATE STUDIES Scott B. Watson, Ph.D. iii Abstract Athletics and academic performance has been studied at length over the years in the literature. Despite the mostly university level research conducted, no consensus has been reached regarding the impact of athletic participation on academic performance at the high school level. As a result, the relationship between the in season and out of season school academic performance of high school sophomores and juniors in one high school was investigated in this study. It was determined that there was a significant relationship that existed between academic performance, measured by GPA, and athletic participation. Through an analysis of 249 high school sophomore and junior boys and girls, it was found that athletic participation had a positive impact on academic performance and that impact may be attributable to the difference between male in season and out of season performance. iv ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I wish to thank all of those who have supported my efforts in the accomplishment of this study: \u2022 My advisor, Dr. Clarence Holland, who provided encouragement, assistance and advice during my work. \u2022 My committee members, Dr. Vance Pickard and Dr. Ellen Black, who shared insights, experience and vision which kept me focused throughout the study. \u2022 All of the members of the Rose Tree Media School District who cooperated generously with my many requests during the study.

The Protection and Prioritization of College Athletics in an Era of Neoliberal Austerity Affiliation Academics Versus Athletics? The Protection and Prioritization of College Athletics in an Era of Neoliberal Austerity Author Affiliation Abstract In an era of neoliberal capitalism, public funding to higher education has increasingly been subject to austerity measures that, based on cost-benefit analyses, have resulted in privatization, tuition hikes, outsourcing, and program, staff, and pay cuts. Official rationales for such measures center on cost effectiveness as well as institutional health and efficiency, yet the elephant in the room remains: that of continued financial and institutional support of college athletics. Originally devised to be supplemental to academic programs, university sports have expanded into revenue generating systems of mass entertainment becoming institutional vehicles for the potential acquisition of status and money. Yet, the majority of US colleges report that their athletic programs operate at a financial loss. Here, drawing on Thompson's (2005: 23) conceptualization of neoliberalism as an \"ethic, a set of political imperatives, and a cultural logic,\" the protection of college athletics over academics will be further unpacked, paying specific attention to institutional priorities where the continuation of athletic spending on 'big sports' is considered sacrosanct. \u00a9 T",

This article explores effective strategies and insights to help student-athletes achieve harmony between their academic responsibilities and athletic ambitions.

Student-athletes must develop the ability to prioritize tasks and make the most of their limited time. Here are some practical tips: Communication: A Key to Success Open and honest communication with coaches, teachers, and academic advisors is vital for student-athletes. Building a supportive network can provide the necessary flexibility and understanding to manage both commitments effectively. Here\u2019s how communication can be leveraged: Leveraging Resources Many schools and colleges offer resources specifically designed to help student-athletes succeed in both arenas.

Analyses of information collected through online surveys (N= 151) and in-person interviews (N=8) suggest that both non-revenue athletes and revenue athletes value their academics more than athletics. However, comparisons of the two groups indicate that non-revenue athletes value their academics slightly more than do revenue athletes. Revenue athletes struggle with short-term academic goals, such as studying outside of class and turning academic coursework in before the deadline. These findings suggest the need for more effective support policies to help revenue athletes devote more time to their academic courses.

This paper seeks to determine if participation in collegiate athletics is beneficial to a person or if its disadvantages outweigh the advantages. Sixty-seven student-athletes completed a survey during October of 2013 to determine the effects that athletic involvement has had on SDSU\u2019s campus. This study found that participation in athletics is extremely beneficial. These athletes performed better in the classroom, developed impressive time management skills, felt motivated to complete their degree, were motivated to attend classes, and experienced a smoother transition into the college lifestyle.

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance.

Exploring the pros and cons Whether college athletes should be paid or not has been a hot topic for decades. College games have always raked in enormous profits for the respective schools, and the prominent bone of contention is how those revenues are split. Today, we look at the pros and cons of paying college athletes and whether or not that is the right course of action. Many colleges recruit talented sportspeople on the promise of scholarships. Due to the vast sports culture in USA and Canada, college sports attract huge fanbases. According to a 2021 report, college fans are the majority when it comes to sports fans in North America. This leads schools to make serious revenues from their sports programs. In 2017, the NCAA reported $1 billion in revenue. The debate on whether college athletes should be paid Since the NCAA's inception in 1906, the primary rule of the organisation was that college players would be considered amateur athletes. This meant that they would not be paid a wage but instead be compensated through means of academic scholarships. This, understandably, was never popular amongst the players who watched schools make millions in revenue from sporting events without them ever having a slice of the pie. All of this changed in 2021 in a US Supreme Court ruling that said that athletes are entitled to compensation for anything that referenced their names, images, and likeness. Top 20 highest paying sports jobs in the world right now Should college athletes be paid like professional athletes? Most professional athletes have a bigger national or global appeal, and they are paid commensurate to the value they bring to their respective teams. This is similar for college students but at a lower, more regional scale. This is why it is practically impossible for all college athletes to earn salaries similar to those of professionals.

Dozens of sports provide opportunities for teens to earn scholarships so that they can pursue a degree while they play, but critics of this system say that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly enough compensation compared to what could go wrong. College coaches are usually one of the highest-paid state employees as well. Some basketball and gridiron football coaches earn salaries of more than $3 million per year. That means their wages are sometimes higher than their professional counterparts. If a school does well in a specific sport, then it may qualify for financial bonuses from a variety of institutions. Should student-athletes receive a portion of that since they earned it with their performance? On February 20, 2019, Zion Williamson had one of his shoes explode on him while playing basketball. The consensus best college athlete for the season and future #1 NBA draft pick suffered a sprained knee. If he were to step onto the court again, then he would be placing his future at risk while the college and the apparel company sponsoring the program stood to bring in millions of dollars of profit because of the exposure. There are several advantages and disadvantages to consider when looking at the idea of paying college athletes a stipend that goes beyond what they receive with their scholarship. List of the Advantages of Paying College Athletes 1. Paying athletes would eliminate the need for additional employment. Scholarships might pay for books, tuition, and the other common costs of going to college, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay every expense that a student might have. It is not unusual for athletes to find a job outside of their sport and classroom schedule so that they have some spending money to use. Some students don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify for a scholarship, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forced to pay their way while also participating in their sport as a walk-on. This proces",

Can anyone help me with major pros and cons about this topic? a year ago Hey! I'm happy to help you with some pros and cons for your arguments. Pros: 1. Compensation for time and effort: College athletes put in an immense amount of work in their sport, often sacrificing personal time and academics. Paying them would recognize the value they bring to the college. 2. Financial support: Getting paid could help athletes who struggle financially and may rely on their sport as a means to get an education. 3. Incentive to stay in school: Some athletes leave college early to pursue professional careers due to financial pressure. If they were paid, they might stay longer, furthering their education. Cons: 1. Amateurism: Paying college athletes might blur the line between amateur and professional status, eroding the core values of college sports. 2. Budget concerns: Not all colleges have the funds to pay student-athletes, possibly leading to budget cuts in other areas or athletes only choosing well-endowed schools that can afford to pay them. 3.

In 2016, CBS and Turner Broadcasting extended their contact with the NCAA Division 1 basketball tournament with an 8-year, $8.8 billion extension. That placed the value of March Madness at more than $1 billion per year for the first time in history. The extension in 2016 followed a 2010 contract which offered a 14-year agreement to broadcast the annual tournament for $10.8 billion. The NCAA states that 90% of the revenues generated through the games played by student athletes go into services, programs, or direct distribution opportunities which directly benefit member conferences and schools. Aside from equipment access, medical care, scholarships, and travel support, student athletes receive zero compensation for their participation in their chosen support.By definition, paying the athlete would make them a professional. On the other hand, it could be argued that scholarships are an alternative form of payment already being provided. Because of the revenues their activities generate, the pros and cons of paying college athletes are closely scrutinized. List of the Pros of Paying College Athletes 1. It encourages healthier student athletes. Paying college athletes for their participation in sports eliminates the need for them to find outside employment to support themselves. Many scholarships may offer tuition, room, and board coverage in return for participating in a sport, but not every student athlete qualifies for a scholarship. Walk-on players have their images used to generate revenues for the NCAA too for zero compensation. Paying all athletes would allow them to focus on academics and athletics without worrying about making ends meet. 2. It provides relief for families. Families ",

However, this of course comes with certain issues, particularly when it comes to the question whether college athletes should be paid for their performance.

Meanwhile, opponents stand that compensating athletes is potentially harmful to college sports. To gain a good insight about this subject, let us take a look at the pros and cons of paying college athletes. List of Pros of Paying College Athletes 1. It is a good business. The amount of money going around college games is massive, with sponsorships, advertisements and even video games generating money for the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which is a non-profit organization that oversees all collegiate sport activities in the US and controls how they are managed among affiliated schools. This multi-billion dollar association provides outlines on which schools taking part should abide when offering and providing scholarships. Currently, the NCAA is providing limited compensation for athletes, while participant schools are receiving the bulk of the money earned from these athletic events. 2. It provides the needed income for student players. College athletes are the ones going out to the field, putting their bodies on the line and winning games, and not the college, promoters and sponsors. With the huge amount of income generated by these athletic games, it should be a no brainer that these players, like their professional counterparts, deserve a piece of the pie. It goes beyond just playing well. 3. It encourages healthy students. Physical sports, like bask",

If we treat college football like the NFL in regard\u00a0to TV revenue, referred to as Broadcasting NIL (BNIL), theoretically how much would players be making? Below is an illustration of what the distribution might resemble if Power Five college football players were to receive a share equivalent to 48% of their respective conference\u2019s football revenue as BNIL. However, we\u2019ve opted to base this calculation on 48% of the conference\u2019s football-specific revenue, rather than the overall revenue, as college athletic departments must allocate funds to support various sports teams. To compute the distribution, we took 48% of the football revenue (similar to the distribution system in the NFL) and divided it by the estimated number of players in the conference, assuming an average of 100 players per team. Below are the projected figures based on this approach.\u00a0Revenue information\u00a0from www.collegefactual.com. Basepath What is the industry saying? Coach and AD sentiment regarding revenue sharing and broadcasting NIL in college athletics is gradually evolving as the discussion gains momentum. While some states have seen bills aimed at requiring state schools to share a portion of their TV revenue with athletes, it\u2019s become apparent that the financial landscape of college sports is changing. Indiana football coach Tom Allen has been an advocate for NIL reform, drawing a distinction between NIL and a revenue-sharing model akin to the NFL\u2019s salary cap structure. Allen said at the Big Ten media days he sees revenue sharing as the \u201cdirection we have to go.\u201d\u00a0He believes that NIL is market-driven and shouldn\u2019t be earnings-restricted, but if collectively bargained, revenue sharing could work under a cap, enabling teams to allocate funds directly to athletes through su",

What Preliminary Approval of the House Settlement Means for College Sports Insights 10.23.24 Despite previously raising several important concerns relating to the NCAA\u2019s proposed $2.8 billion antitrust settlement in House v. NCAA, federal Judge Claudia Wilken recently granted preliminary approval of the deal in an October 7 order. The tentative settlement, which would provide compensation to past and future student-athletes, now enters its final phase before a final approval hearing next spring. If approved, the settlement will reshape the college sports landscape, replacing the traditional NCAA amateurism model with a system that would permit schools to make direct payments to student-athletes for the first time ever. What does your college or university athletic department need to know about this latest development? How Did We Get Here? The House v. NCAA plaintiffs, led by former collegiate swimmer Graham House, filed a federal lawsuit alleging college athletes should receive compensation for the commercial use of their NIL. The athletes agreed to a settlement with the NCAA and filed for preliminary approval of the deal in July. However, the deal appeared to stall last month when Judge Wilken questioned plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys on several issues during a court hearing. She especially focused on including regulation of name, image and likeness (NIL) deals, damages, and gender disparities. Following the hearing, the parties submitted a revised deal, which contained updated language regarding restrictions on NIL deals. This revised deal was subsequently approved by Judge Wilken. Objections to the settlement are due in January with a fairness hearing set for April 2025. Finer Points of Settlement Past collegiate athlet",

College athletic departments are preparing for U.S. District Judge Claudia Wilken to potentially provide final approval of the settlement in the House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA cases, which would allow for direct revenue sharing with athletes later this year. While many administrators have publicly expressed their school\u2019s intent to participate, most have been understandably shy on specifics. After all, the settlement has yet to be approved and athletic departments are preparing to adjust to new roster limits and how the new category of expenses will fit into their reimagined budgets. Using a combination of public comments and publicly available data, as well as insights from the collectives powered by the agency Student Athlete NIL (SANIL), here are potential revenue-sharing models, based on different athletic department profiles. Texas Tech plans to commit \u2018about 74%\u2019 to football players In a rare example of an athletic department publicly sharing its revenue sharing plans, Texas Tech AD Kirby Hocutt and Deputy AD Jonathan Botros shared the school\u2019s plans with the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal in December.

ADU analyzed the three most recent financial reports that the athletic department submitted to the NCAA.

In this article, Jared Kamrass will delve into the economics of college sports, exploring the revenue streams, financial implications, and the complex dynamics that shape this thriving industry. 1. Revenue Streams in College Sports College sports generate revenue through various streams, including: a) Ticket Sales: Revenue is generated from ticket sales to attend games and events. High-profile matchups and rivalry games often attract large crowds, contributing to substantial ticket revenue. b) Sponsorships and Advertising: Corporate sponsorships and advertising partnerships are a major source of revenue for college sports programs. Companies sponsor teams, stadiums, and events, leveraging the exposure and fan loyalty associated with college sports. c) Media Rights: Broadcasting and media contracts play a significant role in college sports revenue. Television networks and streaming platforms pay substantial fees for the rights to broadcast games, allowing fans across the country to watch their favorite teams. d) Merchandising: College sports merchandise, including jerseys, hats, and memorabilia, generates substantial revenue.

Each league has its own unique system for generating and distributing revenue, which is influenced by factors such as broadcasting rights, sponsorship deals, and ticket sales. In this edition of Beyond the Gates, we will take an in-depth look at how revenue sharing works in the NBA, NHL, MLB, NFL, and MLS. National Basketball Association (NBA) Overall Revenue and Distribution The NBA is one of the most lucrative sports leagues in the world, generating $10.58 billion in revenue during the 2022-23 season. The league's revenue-sharing model is designed to promote competitive balance among its 30 teams. Revenue is primarily generated from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, and ticket sales, and a significant portion of it is shared among all teams. The NBA has a \"soft\" salary cap, which allows teams to exceed the cap under certain conditions, with a luxury tax levied on those who do. The luxury tax collected is redistributed to teams that do not exceed the cap, thereby supporting smaller-market teams. Main Sources of Revenue Broadcasting Rights: The NBA's media rights deals are among the most lucrative in sports, with ESPN, NBC, and Amazon paying a combined $7.4 billion annually starting in 2025. This includes rights to regular-season games, playoffs, and special tournaments. Sponsorships: NBA sponsorship revenue hit a record $1.5 billion in the 2023-24 season. Teams also benefit from individual sponsorship deals, including jersey patches and arena naming rights. Ticket Sales and Merchandi",

By Jason Bolton June 16, 2023 11:12 As college athletes gain the ability to profit off their Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL), there has been a growing concern about the impact of these changes on college sports. While some argue that NIL rights are necessary to provide student-athletes with fair compensation, others warn of potential negative consequences. In this article, we will explore the reasons why NIL may be bad for college sports. One of the main concerns about NIL is that it may create an uneven playing field for college athletics. While some states have passed legislation to allow college athletes to profit from their NIL, other states have not. This means that some schools may have more financial resources to offer potential recruits, giving them an unfair advantage over schools in states without NIL laws. The Southeastern Conference and other college officials have been lobbying for federal regulations on NIL to create a more level playing field. Another issue with NIL is that it could lead to the professionalization of college sports. By allowing athletes to profit from endorsements and sponsorships, some argue that it blurs the line between amateur and professional sports. This could lead to a shift in focus from the educational experience to the financial benefits of playing college sports. Moreover, there is a risk that some athletes may prioritize their NIL deals over their academic and athletic responsibilities. Student-athletes already face a challenging balancing act between their academics and athletics. Adding the pressure to also secure endorsements could lead to a lack of focus on their primary responsibilities. This could result in academic struggles and a decline in athletic performance. Another concern is that NIL could lead to a loss of team cohesion and a focus on individual success. While some athletes may be able to secure lucrative",

That fourth case is set for a hearing Thursday before U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Colorado who is considering the association\u2019s and conferences\u2019 request to have the matter transferred to California, where it likely would be folded into the cases moving toward settlement. Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week. The NCAA Board of Governors also must approve the deal. If the bid to move the fourth case to California is rejected, it could continue in Colorado. If that happens, the NCAA, the conferences and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in the cases seemingly headed toward settlement may have to deal with lawyers who wrote in a filing Tuesday evening that \u201cit seems likely\u201d that one of their plaintiffs \u201cwill opt out of any such settlement t",

Of special interest will be whether schools must comply with Title IX, the federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in any school or education program that receives federal funds. There are many questions to be addressed should a $2.77 billion settlement of House vs. NCAA end up being approved by a federal judge in the months ahead after a key step forward by the NCAA and major conferences Thursday night. Among other things, the settlement is expected to allow the nation's wealthiest schools to spend approximately $20 million each year on their own athletes, beginning as soon as next year. Michael LeRoy, a University of Illinois labor and sports law professor, and Iliana Konidaris, a New York civil rights attorney, said Title IX rules will apply if the schools are tasked with directing payments to athletes. Konidaris said it will be critical for the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s Office for Civil Rights to provide guidance on how revenue sharing and name, image and likeness compensation should be paid to keep schools in Title IX compliance. \u201cIf the universities are going to end up exerting control over the revenue sharing,\u201d Konidaris said, \u201cyou\u2019re going to need to address pay equity very head-on.\u201d Another New York civil rights attorney, Christina Stylianou, said her first instinct is that Title IX would not apply because athletes would be essentially selling their media rights to their school. That said, Stylianou expects the Title IX question to be heavily litigated. WHAT IS TITLE IX?The landmark 1972 law is intended to ensure equity between men and women in education.

A recent NCAA settlement, which allows for revenue sharing of up to $20 million per year with athletes starting in 2025, does not address Title IX compliance specifics, leaving institutions to navigate these decisions independently. Title IX mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must ensure gender equity in sport, which includes equal opportunities, benefits, and financial aid based on sex.\u00a0 Schools must continue to offer equal athletic opportunities without discriminating in the provision of financial aid, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for OCR, wrote in a statement to ESPN. She also emphasized that the principles of Title IX remain unchanged in the new environment, which allows student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness.\u00a0 OCR did not specify whether the new revenue share would be categorized as financial aid, which traditionally requires proportional distribution based on roster spots. This ambiguity forces athletic departments to make potentially contentious decisions such as distributing revenue equally, which could undermine football recruiting competitiveness, or risk legal challenges by favoring male athletes. The lack of federal guidance adds complexity, as schools must avoid gender disparities in benefits and opportunities, regardless of the funding source. Universities are exploring different models, including channeling funds through third parties for endorsement deals, but must ensure these practices comply with Title IX requirements.\u00a0 Schools are awaiting clarity on these regulations, which might only come through future legal rulings or potential legislative action.

Many expect the proposed settlement to become fully approved this Spring. Still, there has undoubtedly been pushback on specific parameters provided, specifically the new roster limit structure, which may put many student-athletes\u2019 dreams of Division I athletics at risk.\u00a0 Initial Revenue Share Cap Has Been Determined\u00a0 One component of this settlement is that student-athletes will receive up to 22% of the average revenue that Power Conference schools generate annually. Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes. Schools are expected to have total control over how they disperse these funds to their athletes next season. The expectation is that many athletic departments will use approximately 90% of the funds for their football and men",

We analyzed the most recent NCAA financial reporting from six Big-12 public universities and arrived at the following revenue sharing estimates: School Total AD Revenue * Revenue Sharing % Est Revenue Sharing 2025 Football Team Share Men's BB Team Share Football & MBB % Average 75,644,977 22% 16,641,895 12,734,006 3,159,941 96% School Total AD Revenue * Revenue Sharing % Est Revenue Sharing 2025 Football Team Share Men's BB Team Share Football & MBB % Colorado 64,049,328 22% 14,090,852 11,253,147 2,256,597 96% Iowa State 83,479,317 22% 18,365,450 13,183,871 4,271,867 95% Kansas State 76,144,789 22% 16,751,854 13,673,694 2,856,660 99% Texas Tech 82,992,017 22% 18,258,244 13,576,092 3,265,487 92% Utah 72,953,805 22% 16,049,837 13,059,791 2,156,117 95% West Virginia 74,250,605 22% 16,335,133 11,657,443 4,152,915 97% Average 75,644,977 22% 16,641,895 12,734,006 3,159,941 96% These estimates assume each school limits total revenue sharing to 22% of its annual athletic department revenues \u2013 this is the percentage utilized for the revenue sharing model outlined in the proposed settlement in House v NCAA.\u00a0 However, a school can elect to share any percentage (or none) of its athletic revenues as long as the annual total payout does not exceed the $ 20.5 million tentative cap. From our analysis, football and men\u2019s basketball will likely account for close to 95% of revenue sharing at most power conference schools.

No sense in pondering certainty. \"Fair to say you wouldn't be here in Paris without \u2026\" \"Definitely,\" he interjects. Evans had just slung a discus 204 feet, 2 inches for Team USA at the Paris Olympics Monday, which wasn't good enough to qualify for Wednesday's medal round. Shortly after, he was asked whether he could've ever made it to the Olympics without the development he got from competing in NCAA sports. It's a no-doubter for Evans. What's more in doubt is the future of NCAA non-revenue sports, which includes track and field, depending on how athletic directors choose to allocate resources. The landmark case of House vs. NCAA is expected to usher in transformative change in college sports in the form of a new revenue sharing model that would be a cash windfall for high-revenue sport athletes, but athletic directors have warned that it could come at the price of discontinuing some non-revenue sports as a cost-saving measure. A settlement agreement in the case has been reached, but hasn't yet been certified by Northern District of California Senior District Judge Claudia Wilken. The settlement could also face legal challenges, but athletic departments in the the Power Four conferences (SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Big 12) are bracing for revenue sharing as a pending reality.

These include models that assume profit-maximizing and win-maximizing (sportsmen) club owners. Both approaches predict that revenue sharing will reduce the demand for player talent, depress player salaries, and transfer revenue from large-market to small-market clubs, but they differ on league parity effects. Empirical work has been sparse due to financial data limitations and has not yielded definitive results on the parity issue. Despite the growing awareness of sports economics in the sports industry, the lack of consensus from theoretical models has resulted in sports leagues searching for an optimal revenue sharing policy. The difficulty in providing consistent policy prescriptions in models that incorporate revenue sharing, salary caps, and other league policies has made economic modeling of sports leagues very difficult and complex. While revenue sharing remains an interesting theoretical modeling issue, it has not bridged the gap to real-world league policies.

Hello, budget cuts; goodbye, college sports. Well, not all of them. Due to the impact of COVID-19, many universities have been experiencing financial problems. One solution that they have found is to cut or cancel sports programs \u2014 but only some of them. Certain sports such as football and basketball generate more profits due to elements such as broadcasting rights, ticket sales and merchandise. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) made $1 billion in revenue during the 2017-2018 basketball season. Around 70% of that revenue was generated from March Madness, the NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament. So the ones in trouble are non-revenue athletic programs, meaning there is no immediate revenue generated from spectators of the sport. Therefore, expenses are covered by sponsorships, donations and fundraising. Stanford University is known for its enormous success in non-revenue sports, so it came as a shock when it decided to permanentl",

The landmark agreement introduces a revenue-sharing model that has the potential to reshape how schools support student-athletes and manage their athletic departments.\u00a0 With a revenue share structure expected to take effect next year, universities are strategizing to adapt to Division I College Athletics\u2019 new financial needs. Many expect the proposed settlement to become fully approved this Spring. Still, there has undoubtedly been pushback on specific parameters provided, specifically the new roster limit structure, which may put many student-athletes\u2019 dreams of Division I athletics at risk.\u00a0 Initial Revenue Share Cap Has Been Determined\u00a0 One component of this settlement is that student-athletes will receive up to 22% of the average revenue that Power Conference schools generate annually. Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes. Schools are expected to have total control over how they disperse these funds to their athletes next season. The expectation is that many athletic departments will use approximately 90% of the funds for their football and men",

In particular, it is unclear how the profits of the large-budget clubs ore affected. In this article, the relationship between one specific revenue-sharing arrangement and owner profits is investigated for clubs in a profit-maximization league using two different models. In a Walrasian equilibrium model, revenue sharing will lower profits, whatever the value of the shore parameter, if the profits of a large-budget club are higher than the average club budget in the league. In a noncooperative Nash equilibrium model, the impact turns out to be theoretically indeterminate.

These include models that assume profit-maximizing and win-maximizing (sportsmen) club owners. Both approaches predict that revenue sharing will reduce the demand for player talent, depress player salaries, and transfer revenue from large-market to small-market clubs, but they differ on league parity effects. Empirical work has been sparse due to financial data limitations and has not yielded definitive results on the parity issue. Despite the growing awareness of sports economics in the sports industry, the lack of consensus from theoretical models has resulted in sports leagues searching for an optimal revenue sharing policy. The difficulty in providing consistent policy prescriptions in models that incorporate revenue sharing, salary caps, and other league policies has made economic modeling of sports leagues very difficult and complex. While revenue sharing remains an interesting theoretical modeling issue, it has not bridged the gap to real-world league policies.

Rev. Online 47 Nick Tremps Introduction Over the past few decades, one particular legal issue has permeated throughout collegiate athletics. At the forefront of every collegiate student-athlete\u2019s mind in recent years is the question: \u201cshould I be getting paid for this?\u201d Or, at the very least, should they be receiving more rights and protections other than financial aid and some athletic gear to proudly wear around campus? At first blush, the answer to these questions for all collegiate student-athletes might appear to be yes. Such athletes spend countless hours training, practicing, and competing in their respective sports, all while balancing a full academic schedule and a social life\u2014assuming they are fortunate enough to have any remaining time. Because these universities undeniably receive, at a minimum, nationwide recognition and increased tuition dollars as a result, student-athletes have begun to ask whether compensation or additional protections are warranted. Relevant to this inquiry is the National Labor Relations Act (the \u201cNLRA\u201d or the \u201cAct\u201d), one possible avenue for receiving such compensation or protections. However, this Note argues that the vast majority of collegiate student-athletes should not be able to enjoy the protections afforded by the NLRA. The recent movement towards classifying studen",

NCAA, a seemingly attractive offer to collegiate athletes, with a hidden clause of destruction for some Revenue-generating sports, like football, will stand to significantly benefit from House v. NCAA. (Photo: JIM SHORIN/ISI Photos) Opinion by From the Community Published Jan. 8, 2025, 10:36 p.m., last updated Jan. 8, 2025, 10:36 p.m. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) recently reached a landmark antitrust case settlement with a group of former student-athletes. Under the agreement, the NCAA will distribute $2.8 billion to college athletes dating back to 2018, in addition to allowing for revenue sharing (up to 22% of annual revenue) between athletic departments and their student-athletes going forward. These new payments and compensation structures are great for revenue-generating athletes. However, lurking in the language of House v. NCAA is one important clause not being discussed on the national stage \u2014 one that will drastically hurt athletes who aren\u2019t football or basketball players. The settlement establishes \u201croster limits\u201d for each sport sanctioned by the NCAA, which\u00a0correspond to the maximum number of athletic scholarships that a coach can issue. For example, the scholarship limit for football will increase from 85 to 105, a spike that most Division 1 (D1) programs will meet. To accommodate this increase and the issuance of payments to athletes for revenue sharing, however, many athletic programs are lowering the personnel counts of non-revenue generating sports, resulting in large-scale cuts. Among the incentives driving these roster cuts is Title IX, which requires each school to offer an equal number of scholarships to both men and women. To expand the number of football scholarships, for instance, athletic directors have two ways of remaining compliant with Title IX: either fund an additional 20 scholarships for both me",

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball. The 65 universities analyzed are members of the Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern, and Atlantic Coast conferences.

The impact will eventually filter down to Division II and Division III athletics, as well as junior college sports. This is the potential trickle down impact of the vast of monetization of college athletics and its adoption to recruiting of high profile athletes via NIL (Name, Image, Likeness) deals. While a growing number of high profile athletes are earning millions of dollars on the college level, college athletic programs are making huge cuts in other areas to fund their NIL programs for revenue generating sports.

To expand the number of football scholarships, for instance, athletic directors have two ways of remaining compliant with Title IX: either fund an additional 20 scholarships for both me",

A new study finds that much of the revenue from football and basketball, which have a high proportion of Black athletes, gets funneled to predominantly white teams. Craig Garthwaite Jordan Keener Matthew J. Notowidigdo Nicole Ozminkowski Michael Meier Craig Garthwaite Jordan Keener Matthew J. Notowidigdo Nicole Ozminkowski College sports are big business. In 2018, they took in an estimated $14 billion. That amount has been steadily growing, driven primarily by TV revenue. Yet, unlike professional athletes, college players aren\u2019t the beneficiaries of this windfall. In professional sports leagues such as the NFL and NBA, about 50 percent of revenue goes to players. For college sports, however, players\u2019 compensation is limited to covering the cost of attending the school and a modest living stipend. So where does the majority of college-sports revenue go? That\u2019s the question Craig Garthwaite, a Kellogg School professor of strategy, tackled along with Nicole Ozminkowski, a graduate student in economics at Northwestern University, Matthew Notowidigdo, previously at Kellogg and now at the University of Chicago, and Jordan Keener at the University of Michigan. They were intrigued by a combination of factors: the steep rise in revenue for college sports, the low percentage of revenue used to compensate players\u2014only 7 percent, by their estimation\u2014and the prevailing argument by universities that it isn\u2019t feasible to pay players. \u201cThey say compensation for players would destroy the nature of amateur athletics because people want to believe players are just like other students,\u201d says Garthwaite, who calls himself a \u201cpretty big college football fan.\u201d He points out that no one makes the same argument for coaches, who are paid massive amounts by the highest-profile programs, even when their teams struggle.

Hello, budget cuts; goodbye, college sports. Well, not all of them. Due to the impact of COVID-19, many universities have been experiencing financial problems. One solution that they have found is to cut or cancel sports programs \u2014 but only some of them. Certain sports such as football and basketball generate more profits due to elements such as broadcasting rights, ticket sales and merchandise. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) made $1 billion in revenue during the 2017-2018 basketball season. Around 70% of that revenue was generated from March Madness, the NCAA Division I Men\u2019s Basketball Tournament. So the ones in trouble are non-revenue athletic programs, meaning there is no immediate revenue generated from spectators of the sport. Therefore, expenses are covered by sponsorships, donations and fundraising.

Some have shut their campuses down completely. But schools that play big-time sports have gone to remarkable lengths to save their football and basketball seasons.\u00a0 Some colleges are testing every player and coach for the virus every day and even that hasn't stopped outbreaks; many games have had to be canceled or rescheduled. But still, they press on. \u00a0 They do it, of course, to keep the TV money coming in from football and basketball. But at the same time, dozens of universities have been eliminating smaller \"secondary\" sports like gymnastics and tennis and swimming. Those sports are getting the axe because they don't generate much revenue, but the dreams of the athletes are no less real. Mike Burns: It was kind of a surgical strike, if you will, you know? A 15-minute call to-- to tell 'em that, \"Your life as you know it is now changed forever.\" Mike Burns is the men's gymnastics coach at the University of Minnesota. On September 10, he and the 18 student athletes on his team were about to start practice when their phones all began to buzz. Mike Burns: We had a text message at about 1:20 p.m. And it said, \"You need to be on a Zoom call at 2:00 p.m.\" On that call, Minnesota athletic director Mark Coyle told them that the men's gymnastics program would be eliminated, along with men's tennis and men's track and field.\u00a0 Coyle said the covid pandemic had blown a multi-million dollar hole in the university's athletic budget. He said they were cutting salaries and costs wherever possible, but that cutting entire sports was necessary too. Shane Wiskus: I do not regret coming to the University of Minnesota one bit. But I'm still mad.\u00a0 Senior Shane Wiskus is the star gymnast on Minnesota's team, which two years ago finished second overall at the NCAA Championships. Shane Wiskus:\u00a0 I think the tea",

Do they cut expenses by eliminating sports, as nearly 30 schools have done this year, or do they find another method to curb spending? Within blue-chip athletic programs operating at the highest levels such as Clemson, Iowa, Minnesota and Stanford \u2014 and at numerous mid-major schools \u2014 the choice was to cut sports, close to 100 in Division I this year and more than 350 total across all divisions. Against that backdrop a national debate has raged about taking away opportunities from athletes who compete in programs that don\u2019t produce significant revenue. Cutting sports such as gymnastics or track and field \u2014 programs that feed the vast majority of athletes to U.S. Olympic teams \u2014 can save $1 million to $2 million annually in athletic budgets of $100 million or more at the Power Five level. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find some better funding models that would stave off what we\u2019re seeing, in terms of athletic directors having to make some hard decisions,\u201d Big East Commissioner Val Ackerman said. The viability of nonrevenue-producing sports was embedded in the conversation about the financial future of college sports last week during the virtual Learfield IMG College Intercollegiate Athletics Forum. The optimism that is typically in abundance at the annual event was still evident, but it was countered by the angst and uncertainty surrounding the College Football Playoff, the NCAA men\u2019s basketball tournament and even the 2021 football season, the most prolific revenue-producing events in college sports. Even college sports leaders at the top of the food chain implored their peers to consider cost-cutting mechanisms that might help preserve lower programs now and down the road.

Upon further inspection, I realized I was watching a sport I had never seen before\u2014fencing. Being unfamiliar with a sport is a rare occurrence for someone like me, who fills literally every free moment with sports. After a few minutes, two other curious onlookers had gathered, and after some deliberation, we concluded that BC was winning. Of course, we were totally oblivious to what was happening, but the energy of the fencers was contagious. As it turned out, BC was winning, and the meet (Match? Contest?) that we were watching was the Northeast Conference Meet. BC swept the men\u2019s and women\u2019s categories in the conference, and I later learned that the Eagles also took second place in their version of the Beanpot (instead of BC, BU, Northeastern, and Harvard, the Fencing Beanpot includes BC, MIT, Harvard, and Brandeis). Other than my small cohort of passersby, BC fencing didn\u2019t seem to have many fans in attendance. Fencing, of course, isn\u2019t the revenue sport that football or men\u2019s basketball is at most schools, which drove me to wonder why it\u2019s existed at BC for at least the past 20 years. If not money, what benefit does a team like fencing bring to the University? The short answer is that non-revenue sports don\u2019t add anything nearly as concrete as cold, hard cash to the University like football does. What they do provide, although oftentimes hidden from the naked eye, is arguably more important ",

The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F.

They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities.

This analysis not only highlights the transformative impact of the $2.8 billion NIL backpay and the introduction of a revenue-sharing framework for athletes but also underscores the far-reaching consequences for non-revenue sports, which might be the biggest losers in this new reality. As athletic departments, particularly those in mid-major programs, grapple with the financial strain of the settlement, these programs face potential cuts, threatening the future of many sports that have long been part of the college athletics fabric.

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball. The 65 universities analyzed are members of the Power Five conferences: the Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12, Southeastern, and Atlantic Coast conferences. More detailed budget breakdowns were available from the 46 public institutions in the sample, but not from sports powerhouse private universities such as Notre Dame and Stanford",

European developmental basketball programs are facing financial strain as players prioritize NCAA hoops over the European club system; the second round of the NBA draft has become drained of talent as high-level college players find NIL pay-for-play contracts more attractive than two-way G league payment; but, the most damning challenge of them all, is the peril many Olympic sports programs in the NCAA are currently facing.\u00c2\u00a0 Unlike most leading nations, the United States does not federally subsidize Olympic sports; instead, it relies almost entirely on private funding and collegiate programs to develop athletes for international competition. This unique reliance on the NCAA and private donors has yet to hold America back on the Olympic stage. However, as college athletics undergo unprecedented financial strain \u00e2\u0080\u0094 due to legal shifts stemming from the\u00c2\u00a0House v.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

Numerous studies related to pay-for-play have been implemented, however, few have examined how student-athletes feel about the pay-for-play model. The purpose of this study will be to explore student-athletes\u2019 perceptions of pay-for-play. In order to understand student-athletes\u2019 perceptions of pay-for-play, a phenomenological research design was chosen. Three former and two current NCAA Division I student-athletes from Liberty University participated in the research. Each participant filled out a survey, completed an in-depth interview and participated in a focus group. The participants\u2019 results showed two were proponents of pay-for-play, two were neutral and one was an opponent of the model. The survey results showed no major commonalities were found amongst the subgroups of the student-athletes. The individual interviews and focus groups exposed the only commonality found amongst similar viewpoints was the personal research a participant has done about the pay-for-play model.

While it seems like a win for student-athletes, NIL\u2019s impact on college sports is far from black and white. You might\u2019ve heard the cheers for NIL, hailing it as a groundbreaking shift towards fairness. But have you considered the consequences? From disrupting team dynamics to widening the gap between powerhouse programs and the underdogs, NIL\u2019s ripple effects could tarnish the very spirit of collegiate competition. As you dive into the heart of college sports, it\u2019s crucial to peel back the layers of NIL\u2019s glossy surface. Let\u2019s explore why this seemingly positive change might be a game-changer\u2014for all the wrong reasons. The Impact of NIL on College Sports Have you ever thought about how NIL changes the game for student-athletes? Imagine the locker room where some players are cashing in on their fame while others sit on the sidelines, not just in the game, but in the NIL deals too. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and you, as a sports fan, know how camaraderie and unity are indispensable for a team\u2019s success. Team dynamics are shifting as players now have another layer of complexity to navigate. Star athletes may be more inclined to focus on personal branding opportunities than on that next big play. Your times on the field taught you that it\u2019s not just about skill; it\u2019s the brotherhood, the collective effort that lifts a team. Now, the fear is that NIL could throw off that balance. Another concern is that NIL could widen the financial disparity between programs. Powerhouse schools with more exposure can attract top talent with promises of lucrative NIL deals. This doesn\u2019t just affect recruitment; it changes the nature of competition. The repercussions could res",

The Genesis of NIL in College Sports NIL rights emerged from a long-standing debate within the NCAA about athlete compensation.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

You might\u2019ve heard the cheers for NIL, hailing it as a groundbreaking shift towards fairness. But have you considered the consequences?

Let\u2019s explore why this seemingly positive change might be a game-changer\u2014for all the wrong reasons. The Impact of NIL on College Sports Have you ever thought about how NIL changes the game for student-athletes? Imagine the locker room where some players are cashing in on their fame while others sit on the sidelines, not just in the game, but in the NIL deals too. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and you, as a sports fan, know how camaraderie and unity are indispensable for a team\u2019s success. Team dynamics are shifting as players now have another layer of complexity to navigate. Star athletes may be more inclined to focus on personal branding opportunities than on that next big play. Your times on the field taught you that it\u2019s not just about skill; it\u2019s the brotherhood, the collective effort that lifts a team. Now, the fear is that NIL could throw off that balance.

A Study of Professional Ice Hockey Players Noah Stefanec Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, USA Email: noahstefanec@hotmail.com Received May 3rd, 2012; revised June 8th, 2012; accepted June 19th, 2012 Here, I employ an unbalanced panel of data from the National Hockey League (NHL) to examine the im- pact of pay disparity on team-cohesiveness. I find evidence to suggest the existence of a negative rela- tionship between higher degrees of within-position pay disparity and team performance; the evidence re- ported here shows a simple monotonic elasticity of team performance with respect to pay disparity to be roughly 19%. Keywords: Relative Compensation; Pay Compression; Industrial Politics Introduction Insights into the general nature of relative compensation schemes reveal that enhanced cooperation amongst workers in a firm can be achieved via compression of the wage structure. Proponents of this theoretical concept, such as Milgrom and Roberts (1988), Akerlof and Yellen (1988, 1990), Lazear (1989), and Levine (1991), offer convincing, well-motivated, and detailed theoretical justifications for the effectiveness of pay compression on improved team-cohesiveness. Conceptually, the notion is quite simple: If a relatively large degree of earn- ings inequality was to exist in",

By breaking down team dispersion into conditional and expected components, we find that expected pay dispersion has a positive effect on team and individual performance. We find that team and individual performances are essentially orthogonal to conditional pay inequality, counter to the hypotheses of fairness and cohesion proposed in the literature both for sports and general occupations. A change in collective bargaining regime in 1996 had little impact on either team or player productivity. Research Highlights \u25ba How is worker productivity affected by variations in intra-firm pay inequality? \u25ba We examine this question using data from the National Basketball Association. \u25ba Team and worker performance vary positively with expected (\u2018justified\u2019) pay inequality. \u25ba Team and worker performance are unaffected by unjustified (conditional) pay inequality. \u25ba Our results are consistent with tournament theory. Introduction This paper will analyze the relationship between pay disparity and individual player performance in a particular team sports setting, the National Basketball Association (NBA).

Home By Colleges Ranking By Schools/Majors Ranking By US States By Degrees/Majors News CH Home Colleges News by LLM The Impact and Future of NIL Policies in College Sports The Impact and Future of NIL Policies in College Sports Introduction: The New Era of College Athletics The introduction of Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights has marked a transformative moment in the landscape of college athletics, fundamentally altering the relationship between student-athletes, universities, and the lucrative sports industry. Historically, the NCAA maintained a strict amateurism model, which prohibited athletes from profiting from their personal brands, despite the billions generated by college sports. This model was rooted in the belief that college athletes should prioritize education and athletic competition over financial gain. However, a series of legal challenges, including landmark rulings such as the NCAA v. Alston case, have dismantled these restrictions, paving the way for athletes to monetize their NIL rights. The shift to an NIL framework allows student-athletes to engage in endorsement deals, sell merchandise, and profit from their social media presence. This newfound ability to capitalize on their personal brands represents a significant departure from the traditional amateurism model, which often left athletes without any financial compensation for their contributions to their universities\u2019 athletic programs. The implications of this shift are profound, as it not only empowers athletes to secure financial opportunities but also raises questions about equity, competitive balance, and the overall structure of college sports. As universities adapt to this evolving landscape, institutions like Duke University are taking proactive steps to support their student-athletes in navigating the complexities of NIL.

This rule, publicly regarded as unfair, was put in place to protect the amateur status of those competing in college sports, while others, including coaches and schools, profited from athletes\u2019 NIL. After years of resisting changes to this rule, the NCAA finally capitulated as several states were poised to implement laws that would allow student athletes to receive NIL benefits. These new laws came about thanks in part to a lawsuit filed by former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon claiming damages from a video game producer who profited from his NIL. With this new era comes tremendous opportunities, challenges and responsibility for student athletes and the schools they play for. Access to NIL opportunities is the first step in a long-awaited process to pay college athletes a share of the revenue generated by mega media deals derived from some, but not all, college sports. Of the more than 30 sports sponsored by the NCAA (USC has 21), only men\u2019s basketball and football turn a profit. These two sports, which typically underwrite athletic department budgets including Olympic sports, are made up of more than 80% young Black men, often from low-income backgrounds. Now that NIL is allowed, several student athletes have landed five- and six-figure endorsement deals, and some choose to use their NIL platforms to leverage community service and social justice initiatives. The challenges associated with NIL include avoiding illegal inducement of potential student athletes and navigating the mental health concerns stemming from managing yet another demand on student athletes\u2019 time and self-image.

Since the NCAA allowed athletes to profit from their NIL rights starting in July 2021, the landscape of college athletics has shifted dramatically. For sports enthusiasts and Bishop Business customers alike, understanding NIL is essential to grasping the evolving nature of college sports. This article is the first in a series where we\u2019ll break down what NIL means, its rules, and its impact on athletes, schools, and fans. What is NIL? NIL allows college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness through various means such as endorsements, sponsorships, social media, merchandise, and more. Previously, the NCAA prohibited student-athletes from receiving compensation for their NIL rights, but this restriction has now been lifted, opening a world of opportunities for athletes to monetize their personal brands. The Rules Around NIL While the NCAA has opened the door to NIL, they\u2019ve left much of the regulation to individual states and schools. Here are some general guidelines: No Pay for Play:\u00a0NIL deals cannot be tied directly to athletic performance or enrollment at a specific school. For example, companies can sponsor athletes, but they can\u2019t pay them solely to attend a certain college. No School-Sourced Deals: Colleges and universities cannot directly pay athletes for their NIL. They also cannot negotiate deals for them. However, some schools provide resource",

But there\u2019s a storm brewing on the horizon, and it\u2019s called NIL\u2014Name, Image, and Likeness. While it seems like a win for student-athletes, NIL\u2019s impact on college sports is far from black and white. You might\u2019ve heard the cheers for NIL, hailing it as a groundbreaking shift towards fairness. But have you considered the consequences? From disrupting team dynamics to widening the gap between powerhouse programs and the underdogs, NIL\u2019s ripple effects could tarnish the very spirit of collegiate competition. As you dive into the heart of college sports, it\u2019s crucial to peel back the layers of NIL\u2019s glossy surface. Let\u2019s explore why this seemingly positive change might be a game-changer\u2014for all the wrong reasons. The Impact of NIL on College Sports Have you ever thought about how NIL changes the game for student-athletes? Imagine the locker room where some players are cashing in on their fame while others sit on the sidelines, not just in the game, but in the NIL deals too. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and you, as a sports fan, know how camaraderie and unity are indispensable for a team\u2019s success. Team dynamics are shifting as players now have another layer of complexity to navigate. Star athletes may be more inclined to focus on personal branding opportunities than on that next big play. Your times on the field taught you that it\u2019s not just about skill; it\u2019s the brotherhood, the collective effort that lifts a team. Now, the fear is that NIL could throw off that balance. Another concern is that NIL could widen the financial disparity between programs. Powerhouse schools with more exposure can attract top talent with promises of lucrative NIL deals.

High-profile football figures like Alabama legend Nick Saban and Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin worried out loud that a landscape that features high-profile recruits, transfers, or even players buried on the depth chart making more money through NIL deals than established stars could destroy a locker room. Even former basketball coach and ESPN analyst Fran Fraschilla warned talented teams will \u201ccrack\u201d because of NIL. \u201cThere are all kinds of issues that are coming,\u201d Kiffin told Sports Illustrated in May 2022.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

While it seems like a win for student-athletes, NIL\u2019s impact on college sports is far from black and white. You might\u2019ve heard the cheers for NIL, hailing it as a groundbreaking shift towards fairness. But have you considered the consequences? From disrupting team dynamics to widening the gap between powerhouse programs and the underdogs, NIL\u2019s ripple effects could tarnish the very spirit of collegiate competition.

Let\u2019s explore why this seemingly positive change might be a game-changer\u2014for all the wrong reasons. The Impact of NIL on College Sports Have you ever thought about how NIL changes the game for student-athletes? Imagine the locker room where some players are cashing in on their fame while others sit on the sidelines, not just in the game, but in the NIL deals too. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and you, as a sports fan, know how camaraderie and unity are indispensable for a team\u2019s success. Team dynamics are shifting as players now have another layer of complexity to navigate. Star athletes may be more inclined to focus on personal branding opportunities than on that next big play. Your times on the field taught you that it\u2019s not just about skill; it\u2019s the brotherhood, the collective effort that lifts a team. Now, the fear is that NIL could throw off that balance. Another concern is that NIL could widen the financial disparity between programs. Powerhouse schools with more exposure can attract top talent with promises of lucrative NIL deals.

College football\u2019s biggest donors have \"orchestrated business ventures that are distributing five-, six- and seven-figure payments to athletes under the guise of endorsement opportunities and appearance fees.\" They also are \"pooling millions of their dollars in creating exclusive, high-priced clubs -- 'collectives' -- to retain current players, entice high school prospects or poach athletes from other programs.\" These \"savvy and wealthy\" businesspeople are \"skirting vague NCAA guidelines that govern athlete compensation, many protected by their own state laws, with legislation in some areas being rewritten to further empower such behavior.\" Experts believe \"more than 100 collectives exist,\" and these collectives \"vary in models, membership and financial capabilities, but their goals are mainly the same: to fund their schools\u2019 rosters.\" MAC Commissioner Jon Steinbrecher said, \"We are exactly where we didn\u2019t want to go. We\u2019ve talked long and hard about how institutions are not supposed to be in the business of setting up things, and we are seeing that institutions are now setting up these collectives. That\u2019s not name, image and likeness -- that\u2019s pay for play.\" Collectives at elite Power 5 programs are \"developing a baseline of planning to pay each current football player or prospect a standard salary.\" Opendorse manages 12 collectives that have \"raised nearly $50 million combined.\" By year\u2019s end, Opendorse expects that number to \"be over $100 million\" (SI.com, 5/2).

The Controversy Surrounding NIL Deals: Why Are Some People Against It? By Jason Bolton September 14, 2023 03:42 In recent years, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) has made significant changes to its policies, allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through marketing deals. While this decision has been hailed as a victory for athlete compensation, it has also sparked a heated debate. This article explores the reasons why some people are against NIL deals and the concerns they raise. Fairness and Egotism: One of the primary concerns raised by critics is the potential for NIL deals to create unfair advantages and breed egotism among college athletes. With the opportunity to earn substantial sums of money, there is a fear that athletes from high-profile sports or prominent institutions may overshadow their counterparts, creating an uneven playing field. Distractions and Time Management: Another argument against NIL deals revolves around the potential distractions they pose to student-athletes. Balancing academics, sports, and now marketing commitments can be overwhelming and may affect athletes' ability to prioritize their studies and athletic performance. Critics worry that the additional responsibilities associated with NIL deals may hinder athletes' overall development and progress. Coaches' Mixed Opinions: Coaches play a crucial role in shaping and guiding student-athletes' careers. However, they have mixed opinions on NIL deals. While some coaches support the new rules, acknowledging that they provide fair compensation for athletes, others express concerns about the challenges it brings. These concerns range from maintaining team cohesion to navigating the complexities of managing individual marketing deals within a team dynamic.

While it seems like a win for student-athletes, NIL\u2019s impact on college sports is far from black and white. You might\u2019ve heard the cheers for NIL, hailing it as a groundbreaking shift towards fairness. But have you considered the consequences? From disrupting team dynamics to widening the gap between powerhouse programs and the underdogs, NIL\u2019s ripple effects could tarnish the very spirit of collegiate competition. As you dive into the heart of college sports, it\u2019s crucial to peel back the layers of NIL\u2019s glossy surface. Let\u2019s explore why this seemingly positive change might be a game-changer\u2014for all the wrong reasons. The Impact of NIL on College Sports Have you ever thought about how NIL changes the game for student-athletes? Imagine the locker room where some players are cashing in on their fame while others sit on the sidelines, not just in the game, but in the NIL deals too. It\u2019s a delicate balance, and you, as a sports fan, know how camaraderie and unity are indispensable for a team\u2019s success. Team dynamics are shifting as players now have another layer of complexity to navigate. Star athletes may be more inclined to focus on personal branding opportunities than on that next big play. Your times on the field taught you that it\u2019s not just about skill; it\u2019s the brotherhood, the collective effort that lifts a team. Now, the fear is that NIL could throw off that balance. Another concern is that NIL could widen the financial disparity between programs. Powerhouse schools with more exposure can attract top talent with promises of lucrative NIL deals. This doesn\u2019t just affect recruitment; it changes the nature of competition. The repercussions could res",

As athletes gain the ability to profit from their personal brands, evaluating the impact of NIL on college sports programs is vital. This exploration will shed light on how NIL is influencing recruitment strategies, team culture, and the financial landscape of college athletics, as well as the challenges and opportunities these changes present for sports programs across the country. The Evolution of NCAA NIL Rules The journey of NCAA NIL rules is a reflection of evolving societal attitudes towards fairness and equity in college sports. Initially, the NCAA's strict amateurism policies prohibited athletes from profiting from their NIL to maintain the 'purity' of college sports. This meant no endorsements, autograph signings, or personal brand building beyond the educational institution's requirements. As the years progressed, public sentiment began challenging these restrictions, especially considering the substantial revenues universities and the NCAA generated from college sports. The conversation around NIL and NCAA became more heated, leading to various legal battles and increasing pressure from student-athletes advocating for their rights. During this period, the University of Central Florida\u2019s kicker Donald De La Haye was a pivotal figure. Entering the modern era, NIL legislation started to gain traction, driven by landmark instances calling for change. Before current NIL policies were established, states like California began passing their own NIL laws, culminating in the significant California Fair Pay ",

Time Management: A Delicate Balancing Act The survey results paint a picture of student-athletes grappling with time management in the NIL era. Over half (54%) acknowledged that NIL has impacted the time they dedicate to athletics, academics, and personal pursuits. 18% strongly agree that they've had to make substantial sacrifices and adjustments to their schedules to accommodate NIL activities. This highlights a need for universities and high schools to equip student-athletes with the tools and NIL education necessary to effectively navigate the demands of NIL while upholding their academic and athletic commitments. Financial Well-being: A Double-Edged Sword The financial benefits of NIL are undeniable, with 60% of respondents affirming that it has improved their financial situation - to some degree. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. Only 24% feel a true sense of greater financial independence or security. This underscores the importance of financial literacy programs tailored to student-athletes. By educating student-athletes about budgeting, investing, and long-term financial planning, schools can empower student-athletes to maximize the benefits of NIL while mitigating potential financial pitfalls.

Many athletes have celebrated new opportunities, such as Jaden Rashada, who was once set to sign a $9.5 million NIL deal. Yet, with these opportunities come instances of broken promises, highlighting the challenges and pitfalls in the NIL landscape. Broken promises in NIL deals can leave athletes disappointed and uncertain about their futures. Schools and athletes often face complexities, with schools needing to manage their agreements carefully to prevent conflicts, like endorsing competing clothing brands. These issues have raised concerns about stability and fairness for young athletes entering into contracts for the first time.

High-profile football figures like Alabama legend Nick Saban and Ole Miss coach Lane Kiffin worried out loud that a landscape that features high-profile recruits, transfers, or even players buried on the depth chart making more money through NIL deals than established stars could destroy a locker room.

The Aspen Institute discussion explored the implications if NCAA athletes could be paid by outside entities for use of their names, images, and likenesses, like any college student. While speaking at the Aspen Institute in 2016, NCAA president Mark Emmert raised concerns that University of Texas swimmer Joseph Schooling had recently received a $740,000 bonus from Singapore for winning a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics. Schooling didn\u2019t just win gold; he was Singapore\u2019s first Olympic gold medalist and beat the great Michael Phelps. This payment was perfectly permissible under NCAA rules, which since 2001 have allowed US Olympians to compete in college while pocketing tens of thousands of dollars (and sometimes six figures) from the United States Olympic Committee for winning gold, silver, or bronze. The NCAA added an exception in 2015 to also allow international athletes to receive bonuses. Still, a college swimmer making nearly three-quarters of a million dollars concerned some NCAA members because, Emmert said, \u201cthat\u2019s a little different than 15 grand for the silver medal for the US of A. \u2026 The members at that time hadn\u2019t anticipated this phenomenon of like the Singaporean kid getting paid a very large amount.\u201d Never mind that NCAA rules allow two-sport athletes to be paid professionals in one sport while competing in a different college sport, such as Kyle Parker\u2019s $1.4 million baseball signing bonus while serving as Clemson\u2019s quarterback in 2010. Or that tennis players can receive up to $10,000 per year in prize money (and additional cash on a per-event basis) before or during college. Or that",

Those were just some of the findings from a new study of college sports fans conducted by Horizon Media and Scout Sports & Entertainment. They discovered that fans generally support the NIL rules that permit college athletes to monetize their rights. Perhaps just as importantly, the fans support the brands that have aligned themselves with the athletes. The survey found that brands enhance their appeal when they pay college athletes to endorse their products. The report concluded that fans are more likely to favor brands that hire athletes for endorsements. \u201cThe study came about because we wanted to know what kind of fan sentiment there was around these new NCAA rules,\u201d said Marnie Heard, senior vice president and managing director at Horizon\u2019s WHY Group, which conducted the survey. \u201cThis presents a huge, untapped opportunity.\u201d That information is pertinent for brands and agencies, especially those that have taken a seat on the sideline while the NIL marketplace has taken shape.

Numerous studies related to pay-for-play have been implemented, however, few have examined how student-athletes feel about the pay-for-play model. The purpose of this study will be to explore student-athletes\u2019 perceptions of pay-for-play. In order to understand student-athletes\u2019 perceptions of pay-for-play, a phenomenological research design was chosen. Three former and two current NCAA Division I student-athletes from Liberty University participated in the research. Each participant filled out a survey, completed an in-depth interview and participated in a focus group. The participants\u2019 results showed two were proponents of pay-for-play, two were neutral and one was an opponent of the model. The survey results showed no major commonalities were found amongst the subgroups of the student-athletes. The individual interviews and focus groups exposed the only commonality found amongst similar viewpoints was the personal research a participant has done about the pay-for-play model.

Some argue that college athletes are essentially professionals and deserve to be compensated for their talents, while others claim that paying college athletes would disrupt the amateur sports system. In this article, we will explore the pros and cons of paying college athletes and examine the arguments on both sides. Pros: Increased Revenue for Schools Colleges and universities generate massive revenue from sports programs: According to a report by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Division I schools generated an average of $36 million in revenue from sports programs in 2019-2020. Athletes contribute significantly to this revenue: Many colleges and universities rely heavily on their sports programs to generate revenue, and athletes play a crucial role in attracting fans, sponsors, and donors. Fair Compensation for Athletes Athletes put in long hours and sacrifice personal time: College athletes typically spend 40-50 hours per week on athletic activities, leaving little time for academic pursuits or personal interests. They often face significant expenses: Athletes may incur costs related to equipment, travel, and training, which can be a financial burden. Paying athletes would be a fair compensation for their hard work and dedication: Many argue that paying athletes would be a fair way to recognize their contributions to the college or university. Improved Recruitment and Retention Paying athletes would attract top talent: High school athletes may be more likely to choose colleges and universities that offer compensation for their athletic abilities.

It might cost more to see your favorite NCAA team soon By Tobias Carroll @tobiascarroll November 5, 2024 10:29 am Oklahoma State Cowboys fans wait out a rain delay during a game against the Arizona State Sun Devils at Boone Pickens Stadium. Brian Bahr/Getty Images Earlier this year, the NCAA finalized an agreement that settled three pending federal antitrust cases and answered a long-running discussion over college sports \u2014 namely, whether or not student athletes would be compensated for their work. The agreement, as ESPN reported, allowed colleges and universities in the Power 5 conferences to directly pay athletes, with the schools in question now able to each spend up to $22 million per year. The movement to pay college athletes \u2014 or at least those playing at the highest level \u2014 has been gaining ground ever since the 2011 publication of an article in The Atlantic by Taylor Branch outlining the case for it. The recent settlement opened the door to another question: how are athletic powerhouses going to come up with the money that they\u2019ll soon be using to pay players? The answer, unsurprisingly, could involve raising ticket prices to games \u2014 and that\u2019s just one way universities are ",

Hey! Curious to hear some thoughts on why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I'd like to consider different perspectives to form my own opinion. Thanks! 11 months ago Hello! It's important to consider various perspectives when thinking about whether college athletes should be paid or not. Here are a few common arguments against paying college athletes: 1. Amateurism: One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is preserving the spirit of amateurism in college sports. This means that student-athletes participate in sports for the love and passion they have for the game, not for financial gain. Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

[Image Descriptor: Photo of Chris] Learn about our Editorial Process College athletes should be paid because they bring a substantial amount of money into their colleges, boost admission rates, put in full-time hours, and do not have the time to get a full-time job on top of their sport. And yet, ridiculously, in many sports, it\u2019s illegal to pay college athletes because it\u2019s considered amateur sports. These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

A New York state senator proposed a bill that would give college athletes the ability to sell the rights to their own names and likenesses. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to examine and conduct group comparison on the issue of whether college athletes should be paid. Participants were categorized into fans versus non-fans, and college athletes versus non-athletes. A survey was utilized to collect data from these participants. 71.13% of respondents believe that college athletes should be paid, while 28.87% believe that they should not be paid.

We would all be pretty upset. The NCAA has done the same thing to college athletes. They have gotten together and agreed that none of them will pay college athletes a dime and they will not compete against any teams that pay athletes. Just as we would have no choice but to drink expensive beer, college athletes have no choice but to go unpaid for 4 years as they generate millions in revenue for their schools. I say open college sports to the free market. Instead of talking about whether Julio Jones is a five Star or a four Star, we could be talking about whether or not Alabama should offer him 800 thousand dollars or 1 million dollars. The current system forces football players to make a huge bet on their athletic ability. They bet that if they work hard with no pay for four years they will get a guaranteed 250 thousand dollar salary. They either get zero dollars or 250 thousand dollars, or more. A free market would allow players to still make good money even if they don\u2019t have NFL talent or if they get hurt before their Junior/ Senior year. That\u2019s enough of a reason to pay college athletes for me but I\u2019ve gone ahead and examined some counter arguments. But, They get Paid with Free Tuition?Students pay 100 thousand dollars to go to college for four years, so if you let an athlete go to college, that\u2019s like giving them 100 thousand dollars. Right? Wrong. If you give me 100 thousand dollars worth of cat food, that\u2019s not like giving me $100,000. Most athletes would never pay 100 thousand dollars for school just as I would never spend 100 thousand on cat food.

It might cost more to see your favorite NCAA team soon By Tobias Carroll @tobiascarroll November 5, 2024 10:29 am Oklahoma State Cowboys fans wait out a rain delay during a game against the Arizona State Sun Devils at Boone Pickens Stadium. Brian Bahr/Getty Images Earlier this year, the NCAA finalized an agreement that settled three pending federal antitrust cases and answered a long-running discussion over college sports \u2014 namely, whether or not student athletes would be compensated for their work. The agreement, as ESPN reported, allowed colleges and universities in the Power 5 conferences to directly pay athletes, with the schools in question now able to each spend up to $22 million per year. The movement to pay college athletes \u2014 or at least those playing at the highest level \u2014 has been gaining ground ever since the 2011 publication of an article in The Atlantic by Taylor Branch outlining the case for it.

These scholarships can include tuition, room and board, and sometimes even extra stipends for living expenses. While the NCAA allows schools to offer scholarships to talented athletes, the financial landscape is changing. With recent developments allowing athletes to earn money through endorsements and other avenues, questions arise about the fairness of the current system.

The decision allows schools to now provide student-athletes modest, education-related payments. But a new nationally representative survey of 1,000 respondents conducted by YouGov for the Bucknell Institute for Public Policy (BIPP) found that while 60% of the public supported athletes being able to make money by selling or endorsing products with their own image or likeness, only 26% supported paying college athletes directly from university funds, with 45% opposed. Both college sports fans and non-sports fans were in agreement on their support for athletes making money from their own image or likeness \u2014 at 62% and 59% respectively \u2014 but there were differences by political affiliation, with 69% of Democrats and 61% of independents supporting the idea, compared with 42% of Republicans.

It's difficult for any fair-minded American to look at the vast amounts of money flowing into college sports and not see hypocrisy in its reliance on an unpaid labor force.\u00a0 When the legal threats to amateurism began to emerge about a dozen years ago, the NCAA\u2019s main strategy was to claim that college sports would become less popular if athletes earned money.\u00a0 Administrators said it repeatedly in the media. They said it in court. They even threatened to take their ball and go home if schools had to pay the athletes who help generate hundreds of millions of dollars playing college football and basketball. And now they all need to admit that they were wrong. Historically, spectacularly, wrong.\u00a0 A new national survey commissioned by Sportico in cooperation with The Harris Poll found that 67 percent of American adults believe college athletes should be paid \u2014 not just through name, image and likeness payments but in direct compensation from the school.\u00a0 Further, 64 percent of those surveyed believed athletes should be able to claim status as employees, and 59 percent were in favor of college athletes being able to bargain as a union.\u00a0 The numbers were relatively consistent across a variety of demographic groups. Whether man or woman, Democrat or Republican, white or Black, the notion of paying college athletes was supported by a majority of respondents.

The poll, conducted by YouGov on behalf of The Huffington Post, found that only 24 percent of those asked said that \"student athletes should be paid for the time they devote to the team,\" while 56 percent believed a full scholarship was sufficient. They were more divided, however, on whether athletes should receive up to $5,000 per year for the use of their names, images and likenesses, with 35 percent strongly or somewhat supportive and an equal number opposed. If athletes were compensated, the majority of fans wouldn't have a change of heart about college sports, the poll found. Of the respondents who at least watch college sports occasionally, 66 percent said a $5,000 annual payment would not affect their level of interest, compared to 16 percent who said they would be less interested. Of those who said they would be less interested, 41 percent said they\u2019d stop watching altogether -- though that amounts to about 7 percent of the respondents who said they watched collegiate sports at least on occasion.

Sports change and evolve. They adapt to the shifts in culture and, in many cases, cause them. Yet while some aspects of athletics can be revolutionary, others are more reactionary. Two recent releases from University of Texas Press capture the two sides of this dichotomy. First, there is Frank Andre Guridy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Sports Revolution which captures a sporting world in motion as the Civil Rights Movement and second-wave feminism were transforming the country. Second, Ronald A. Smith\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Myth of the Amateur captures a more reactionary organization (the NCAA) as they attempt to redefine what it means for collegians to be \u00e2\u0080\u009cstudent-athletes,\u00e2\u0080\u009d fighting against rights for players in the process. Both books are ultimately successes, though each succeeds in a different way. Guridy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s The Sports Revolution examines the ways the world of athletics changed and evolved in Texas from the end of Jim Crow to the early 1980s. Accordingly, much of the book looks at the gains made by Black athletes and women in arenas where their participation had previously been denied. In addition to that, it is also a tale of a changing society where newly wealthy Texans who had earned millions in oil fields decided to invest it in sports as a way of showing the rest of the country that they had indeed arrived. It thus captures the transformation of previously rural areas into massive metropolises whose identity was shaped by their professional sports teams. Altogether it is a book that looks at the different impacts sports can have: \u00e2\u0080\u009con a region\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political economy; on the country\u00e2\u0080\u0099s popular culture; on the ways manhood, womanhood, whiteness, blackness, and social belonging were understood and reimagined.\u00e2\u0080\u009d These threads are all engagingly and intelligently brought together throughout The Sports Revolution.

As of 2015, NCAA Division I member-universities can offer financial aid to student-athletes that would cover tuition and fees, room and board, textbooks, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. Any other financial aid offered to or accepted by student-athletes is strictly forbidden and may violate the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules. Critics of the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules have argued for a fairer system, where Division I football and basketball players would receive a share of the profits earned from their skills, images, names, and likenesses. The Supreme Court recently denied petitions in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA\u2014a case involving the issue of whether NCAA Division I student-athletes may be paid for the commercial use of their images, names, and likenesses. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s petition denial in O\u2019Bannon, and because the NCAA is routinely involved in similar litigation, this article provides an overview and analysis of the current status of amateurism in the NCAA. \u00a0Context A number of high-profile NCAA Division I student-athletes have been penalized for violations of the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules, such as Todd Gurley, a former University of Georgia running back, who was suspended for four games after receiving $400 for roughly 80 autographs. Likewise, Terrelle Pryor, a former Ohio State University quarterback, was suspended for five games for selling championship rings and memorabilia, and for accepting free tattoos. The list of penalties is far-reaching, seemingly endless, and not limited to student-athletes.

The concept of amateurism in the context of college sports is primarily defined and enforced by the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). The NCAA establishes eligibility requirements that student-athletes must meet to maintain their amateur status and compete in college athletics. Amateurism is closely related to eligibility for athletes- to participate in college sports student-athletes must maintain their amateur status, which means they cannot receive compensation beyond the value of their scholarships and related educational expenses. If a student-athlete were to accept payment for their athletic performance or endorsements, they risk losing their eligibility to compete in NCAA-sanctioned events. Increased Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) opportunities for student-athletes could potentially challenge the current definition of amateurism. As NIL rights expand and athletes have more opportunities to profit from their image and likeness, it blurs the line between amateur and professional status. While the NCAA has introduced NIL regulations to allow student-athletes to benefit from their NIL rights, concerns arise about whether these changes could ultimately lead to a reevaluation of the traditional concept of amateurism in college sports. The Birth of Amateurism: Early Roots in College Sports The roots of amateurism in college sports can be traced back to the late 19th century when collegiate athletics first began to take shape in the United States.\u00a0 College athletics in the United States finds its origins in the 19th century when informal sports activities like rowing and track and field gained popularity among students.

The NCAA\u2019s decision to allow athletes to earn from NIL deals has significantly impacted their financial stability and career choices. Players who might have jumped to professional leagues prematurely now contemplate staying longer in college, as they can earn substantial income through various endorsements and partnerships. This shift has led to a more balanced playing field where universities strive to offer better NIL opportunities, affecting recruiting strategies and team dynamics. For instance, high-profile players now consider the potential for lucrative deals when choosing schools, which influences the competitive balance in college basketball.

The majority of college sports fans who are 18-34 believe that college athletes should be paid a salary on top of their name, image and likeness sponsorships. But fans 65-and-over don\u2019t show the same enthusiasm for paying players. In fact, 47% of them disagree with the pay-for-play approach. Those were just some of the findings from a new study of college sports fans conducted by Horizon Media and Scout Sports & Entertainment. They discovered that fans generally support the NIL rules that permit college athletes to monetize their rights. Perhaps just as importantly, the fans support the brands that have aligned themselves with the athletes. The survey found that brands enhance their appeal when they pay college athletes to endorse their products. The report concluded that fans are more likely to favor brands that hire athletes for endorsements. \u201cThe study came about because we wanted to know what kind of fan sentiment there was around these new NCAA rules,\u201d said Marnie Heard, senior vice president and managing director at Horizon\u2019s WHY Group, which conducted the survey. \u201cThis presents a huge, untapped opportunity.\u201d That information is pertinent for brands and agencies, especially those that have taken a seat on the sideline while the NIL marketplace has taken shape.

The NCAA now supports athletes making money off endorsements, merchandise sales, and social media, opening new doors for financial opportunities.

If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019re settling in for a daylong slate of college football games. As always, you\u2019ll probably spend money related to the games \u2014 beer at a sports bar, bets on a mobile app, tickets, merchandise. But did you know that NIL rules allow even you, the fan, to funnel your disposable income straight to your favorite players? The fan-powered segment of NIL is small, but it\u2019s growing fast. Some in the industry are hoping fan-funded deals, from subscription-based content services to autograph shops, could be NIL\u2019s next big thing. Fan-Powered Deals Could Be the Next Big Thing in NIL Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports As a former Notre Dame walk-on running back, Mick Assaf knew that the vast majority of college athletes wouldn\u2019t generate enough buzz to land the biggest name, image, and likeness deals. They won\u2019t sign flashy contracts with Nike, Bose, or Gatorade. They won\u2019t get millions from an NIL collective. But they can, he told Front Office Sports, earn money from fans. The company he founded, YOKE, is a technology platform that allows fans to pay athletes for content. Assaf isn\u2019t alone. Since the NIL era began, more than a dozen companies have begun exploring ways to facilitate fan-powered NIL deals through various strategies \u2014 a model they hope will \u201cdemocratize\u201d NIL.

Despite being academically prepared, ISAs face high dropout rates due to adjustment difficulties, including cultural assimilation, academic stress, and complex eligibility rules. Their perception of athletics differs from domestic student-athletes (DSAs), viewing it as a comprehensive educational and developmental opportunity. Recruitment challenges for ISAs are intensified by limitations in evaluating universities, thus relying heavily on coaching staff and scholarships. The need for academic and mental health support tailored to ISAs' specific backgrounds is crucial. To embody diversity and inclusion, the NCAA must ensure ISAs receive comprehensive support, promoting a fulfilling experience for all athletes. Coombs, H. V. (2024).

Over the course of the 20th and early 21st century, regulatory changes, court claims, and the beliefs of NCAA authority about student-athlete compensation further developed what an amateur collegiate athlete is entitled to receive. This evolution is what impacted the evolving logistics of the NCAA Bylaw 12, which explains the current definition of amateurism and what it grants or restricts a collegiate athlete to be able to receive as compensation for their participation.[2] These guidelines have been described to both benefit and unjustifiably limit the student-athlete and the success of institutions\u2019 athletic performance. This debate has been a strong driver in court claims against the NCAA and the mainstream controversy about what student-athletes should have the right to receive financially. Background In 1906, one year after a college football season which resulted in the deaths of eighteen students and severe injuries to 150 more, 62 member schools formed the Intercollegiate Athletics Association (IAA).[3] The IAA's main purpose was to regulate collegiate sports and ensure that players were treated fairly and kept safe.[3] Just four years later, the IAA modified its name to become the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). By doing so, the NCAA was granted additional rule-making power which now allowed them to include amateurism and eligibility.[3] The NCAA was designated as a non-profit institution whose focus was to establish amateurism as the core foundation for college sports.[4] At this time, the NCAA did not allow any sort of payment to their amateur athletes from university faculty nor financial aid.[",

Partners University of Florida provides funding as a founding partner of The Conversation US. View all partners Ever since July 1, 2021, student-athletes have been able to pursue endorsement deals. But when it comes to getting paid by the universities for which they play, the students have been shut down. Here, Cyntrice Thomas, a professor of sport management at the University of Florida, answers questions about the hurdles that stand in the way of college athletes being compensated for their athleticism. What stands in the way of paying college sports players? NCAA rules are the main obstacle. Not long after it was formed in 1906, the NCAA prohibited schools from compensating student-athletes for their athletic ability. In 1948, the NCAA adopted the Sanity Code, which also prohibited athletic scholarships for students who couldn\u2019t demonstrate financial need or economic hardship. The organization began to allow athletic scholarships in 1956 without regard to financial need. But that was limited to tuition, room and board, and books. Over time the NCAA has made more allowances, such as funding for medical insurance and by creating the Student Assistance Fund. The fund is meant to \u201ccover unforeseen expenses\u201d related to attending college. Are the rules being challenged? In 2009, Ed O'Bannon, a former UCLA basketball player, sued the NCAA over its rules that limited the amount in scholarships that schools could offer as well as the compensation for student-athletes with regard to the use of their image in video games. O'Bannon was successful in showing that the NCAA\u2019s rules were unlawful, and the court allowe",

Ezra Shaw/Getty Images hide caption A sea change is coming to college athletics. On Thursday, the NCAA and the so-called \"power five\" athletic conferences reached a groundbreaking agreement that seeks to end the century-old tradition of amateurism in college sports by allowing athletes to receive pay directly from the colleges and universities they play for. The agreement, part of a class-action lawsuit known as House v. NCAA, must be approved by a federal judge overseeing the case, a decision that could be months away. Sports NCAA, leagues back $2.8B settlement, setting stage for major change in college sports The proposed settlement has two parts. First, it would distribute some $2.75 billion to athletes who competed before July 2021, when the NCAA first allowed athletes to earn money from their name, image and likeness rights. Second, it would create a future revenue-sharing model in which schools could each distribute around $20 million per year directly to athletes. But far from closing the door on the years of debates and litigation over the question of payments to student athletes, the proposed settlement raises a slate of even more questions: Which athletes will be compensated? How much will they make? Will women be paid equally to men? Will schools that are unable to pay athletes be able to keep up with bigger, richer schools? \"Those are going to be very important details we're going to have to work out,\" said Matt Mitten, a professor of sports law at Marquette University. \"The settlement is just the start.\" Here's what we know and what big issues remain unresolved. What would the proposed settlement cover?

A policy adopted in June 2021 by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) dramatically changed the trajectory of college sports when it allowed student athletes the opportunity to use their personal brand in promoting a company\u2019s products and services under paid marketing agreements with third parties. Some observers say this new policy is a departure from the standard of \u201camateurism\u201d that has stood as the NCAA hallmark of college sports. Others argue that student athletes are subject to unique pressures that other students do not have and therefore they deserve to be paid beyond the compensation they receive in the form of sports scholarships. For example, student athletes face a higher risk of injury which could affect their future career prospects. In addition, student athletes contend with the challenge of balancing a heavy academic workload with the time demands of their sport which may prevent them from holding a part-time job to earn extra income. Craig Esherick, academic program coordinator of the Sport Management program within George Mason University\u2019s School of Sport, Recreation, and Tourism Management (SRTM), recently discussed the pros and cons of whether student-athletes should be paid.

This Note argues that because amateurism standards differ by country, there is no longer competitive equity between domestic and international college athletes. Although possible solutions have been presented to deal with this disparity, such proposed solutions do not sufficiently resolve the problem. Rather, as this Note suggests, a global standard of amateurism that would be applied fairly to all prospective student-athletes regards of country of origin is needed.

Introduction Sports law, a multifaceted legal domain, intersects various disciplines including\u00a0contract law, labour law, antitrust law, and intellectual property rights. This legal landscape governs the complex relationships between athletes, teams, leagues, and governing bodies, shaping the very core of organized\u00a0sports.[1] Within this broad spectrum, college sports represent a particularly tricky arena, where the ideals of amateurism clash with the realities of a multi-billion dollar industry of college sports. In the United States, college sports have grown into a cultural phenomenon that goes beyond the boundaries of academic institutions under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Legal precedents have played a big impact in shaping the landscape of college sports. The landmark case of O'Bannon\u00a0v. NCAA(2014)[2]\u00a0fundamentally challenged the core of the NCAA's\u00a0rules which is amateurism. This decision paved the way for significant changes, including the introduction of\u00a0Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) laws, which allow\u00a0student-athletes to profit from their brand.\u00a0 While these legal battles unfold in the United States, other countries are developing their approaches to balancing athlete development with education.

In fact, every year, students with GPAs above 3.5, including those in honors courses, fail to meet NCAA eligibility due to overlooked requirements. Although the NCAA removed the SAT/ACT requirement in 2020, it\u2019s important to note that individual colleges or scholarship programs might still require these scores.

However, recent changes in legislation and policy regarding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights signal a paradigm shift in college athletics, where student-athletes are now able to monetize their skills and marketability. This paper examines the transformation of \u201camateurism\u201d in the NCAA, arguing that the term has lost much of its original meaning in a landscape where student-athletes are increasingly recognized as economic contributors rather than purely amateur participants. With the erosion of traditional amateur ideals, the NCAA\u2019s definition of amateurism requires a reevaluation to reflect the evolving realities of college sports. Introduction: The Shifting Foundations of Amateurism The NCAA has historically defended amateurism as a foundational principle that preserves the \u201ceducational character\u201d of college sports, asserting that student-athletes should compete without the economic motives typical of professional sports. This stance has provided a rationale for denying athletes compensation beyond scholarships and basic living stipends, based on the belief that such payments would compromise the integrity of college athletics. However, recent developments, particularly the adoption of NIL policies that allow student-athletes to profit from their personal brand, challenge the validity and necessity of amateurism. Today, student-athletes exist in a hybrid role\u2014students who participate in highly commercialized sports and contributors to a billion-dollar industry, casting doubt on the NCAA\u2019s traditional definition of amateurism.

The distinction is made between amateur sporting participants and professional sporting participants, who are paid for the time they spend competing and training. In the majority of sports which feature professional players, the professionals will participate at a higher standard of play than amateur competitors, as they can train full-time without the stress of having another job. The majority of worldwide sporting participants are amateurs. Sporting amateurism was a zealously guarded ideal in the 19th century, especially among the upper classes, but faced steady erosion throughout the 20th century with the continuing growth of pro sports and monetisation of amateur and collegiate sports, and is now strictly held as an ideal by fewer and fewer organisations governing sports, even as they maintain the word \"amateur\" in their titles. Background Modern organized sports developed in the 19th century, with the United Kingdom and the United States taking the lead.[1] Sporting culture was especially strong in private schools and universities, and the upper and middle-class men who attended those institutions played as amateurs. Opportunities for working classes to participate in sport were restricted by their long six-day work weeks and Sunday Sabbatarianism. In the UK, the Factory Act of 1844 gave working men half a day off, making the opportunity to take part in sport more widely available. Working class sportsmen found it hard to play top level sport due to having to turn up for work. On occasion, cash prizes, particularly in individual competitions, could make up the difference;[2] some competitors also wagered on the outcomes of their matches. As professional teams developed, some clubs were willing to make \"broken time\" payments to players, i.e., to pay top sportsmen to take time off work, and as attendances increased, paying men to concentrate on their sport full-time became feasible.

NCAA rules founded on localized amateurism ideals are now being applied on a global scale, in countries where there is no similar concept of amateur athletes. This Note argues that the current NCAA amateurism rules inadequately address the potential amateur issues related to prospective student-athletes from various countries. Examples and evidence of the difficulties of apply localized amateur rules to international recruits are examined and discussed. The background of the amateurism idea and according interpretations by U.S. courts of NCAA rules are explained. This Note argues that because amateurism standards differ by country, there is no longer competitive equity between domestic and international college athletes. Although possible solutions have been presented to deal with this disparity, such proposed solutions do not sufficiently resolve the problem. Rather, as this Note suggests, a global standard of amateurism that would be applied fairly to all prospective student-athletes regards of country of origin is needed. Until such a standard is implemented, problems will continue to arise with the amateur standard of international student-athletes.

As of 2015, NCAA Division I member-universities can offer financial aid to student-athletes that would cover tuition and fees, room and board, textbooks, transportation, and miscellaneous personal expenses. Any other financial aid offered to or accepted by student-athletes is strictly forbidden and may violate the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules. Critics of the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules have argued for a fairer system, where Division I football and basketball players would receive a share of the profits earned from their skills, images, names, and likenesses. The Supreme Court recently denied petitions in O\u2019Bannon v. NCAA\u2014a case involving the issue of whether NCAA Division I student-athletes may be paid for the commercial use of their images, names, and likenesses. Given the Supreme Court\u2019s petition denial in O\u2019Bannon, and because the NCAA is routinely involved in similar litigation, this article provides an overview and analysis of the current status of amateurism in the NCAA. \u00a0Context A number of high-profile NCAA Division I student-athletes have been penalized for violations of the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules, such as Todd Gurley, a former University of Georgia running back, who was suspended for four games after receiving $400 for roughly 80 autographs. Likewise, Terrelle Pryor, a former Ohio State University quarterback, was suspended for five games for selling championship rings and memorabilia, and for accepting free tattoos. The list of penalties is far-reaching, seemingly endless, and not limited to student-athletes. In the 1980s, Southern Methodist University faced the most controversial NCAA penalty to date\u2014a suspension of its football program, otherwise known as the \u201cdeath penalty\u201d\u2014because its football pla",

At issue are NCAA rules preventing conferences from sharing broadcasting revenue with players, denying revenue opportunities for college sports video games and barring NIL prior to 2021.

She previously denied the NCAA\u2019s motion to dismiss. The case is now in pretrial discovery with a trial set for 2025. It threatens the NCAA and Power Five with potential damages that exceed $4 billion. The NCAA could try to settle, but it would need to pay up. It\u2019s unknown how the NCAA, conferences and member schools\u2014and their insurance companies\u2014would determine who pays what. This is the first case that could economically knock down the NCAA and the system of D-I college sports in irreparable ways.

They are fighting their own regulatory board, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), athletic conferences, broadcasters, and licensing entities. The NCAA\u2019s mission is to be \u201can integral part of the educational program\u201d and to maintain the amateur status of student-athletes.2 Amateurism, which is codified in the NCAA\u2019s bylaws, values the distinction between professional and student athletes and is the crux of the NCAA\u2019s argument for maintaining regulations prohibiting the compensation of student-athletes.3 In line with these values, the NCAA regulates the amateur nature of college athletics to ensure that education is a principal priority.4 Recently, however, the controversy surrounding the amateur status of c",

                  "raw_content": " NCAA Amateurism Rules Promote Integrity at a Price \u00a0 By Katherine Mannion, Staff Writer A cornerstone of NCAA athletics has been the staunch enforcement of the amateurism of its athletes. The NCAA\u2019s Division I handbook dedicates almost 30 pages to the concept, defining the ins and outs of where athletes can and cannot be paid before and during their collegiate careers. Among other things, the NCAA bylaws forbids contact with professional teams, prize money, and agent representation.[1] The NCAA, a non-profit that rakes in nearly $1 billion per year, believes that amateurism is crucial to maintain academic integrity for athletes and ensure they prioritize their education over athletics.[2] However, recent developments in college athletics have shown that this definition of amateurism often has a negative effect on young athletes. Violating NCAA eligibility rules can lead athletes to lose years of eligibility and potential post-collegiate income.[3] According to these rules, student athletes cannot be paid beyond the necessary expenses required \u2013 i.e. scholarships, housing, etc.[4] This is good for many reasons, like preventing athletes from signing massive contracts with professional leagues while in school and ensuring that athletes do not shirk academic responsibilities to appeal to professional sports leagues.[5] However, the negative effects that arise upon violating these rules can be damning. For example, as recently as October, N.C. State\u2019s Braxton Beverly was barred from participating in college sports for the 2017-2018 school year because he attended summer classes at Ohio State before transferring to NC State as a freshman in the fall.[6] His decision to get a jump start on his academic career prior to a transfer cost him a year of eligibility. University of Central Florida kicker Donald De La Haye was ruled ineligible because he has a monetized YouTube channel, which provided him with income forbidden by the NCAA eligibility rules.[7] Similarly, Texas A&M distance runner Ryan Trahan was ruled ineligibl",

Here\u2019s what you should know about the case captioned as NCAA v. Alston. NEW: In a victory for college athletes, SCOTUS unanimously invalidates a portion of the NCAA\u2019s \u201camateurism\u201d rules. The court says the NCAA can no longer bar colleges from providing athletes with education-related benefits such as free laptops or paid post-graduate internships. \u2014 SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 21, 2021 Lead plaintiff Shawne Alston\u00a0brought the case on behalf of a class of student athletes, arguing that prohibitions against student-athletes receiving computers, science equipment, and musical instruments amount to anti-competitive activity on the part of the NCAA. The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Alston, affirming the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision\u00a0which upheld an injunction of the rules on the grounds that they constituted\u00a0unreasonable restraint of trade.

Sports Stars Are Natural Prey for Investment Scams Professional athletes are among the most common group of individuals to become victims of investment fraud and scams. After numerous reports of fraud cases, athletes continue to find themselves in financial situations that result in astronomical losses. This begs the obvious question, why? For starters, many professional athletes dedicate their entire lives to their sport in order to perform at an elite level. With little free time left to explore other interests, athletes are often unsophisticated in the world of business and investments. This leaves athletes vulnerable to investment managers who have total control over their funds.[1] Professional athletes are prime targets in that they often are unsophisticated and have large amounts of cash ready to be invested.[2] The sports industry at both the professional and amateur level produces large sums of money that change hands on a daily basis. Lack of time to do their own due diligence, misplaced trust in untrustworthy advisors, and seemingly endless amounts of money make professional athletes prime targets of investment scams. Athletes run into many of the same financial problems that ordinary people do, except with a lot more to lose. Filing for bankruptcy is not uncommon and the causes therefor are multiple, including: \u201c(1) spending like a drunken sailor as if the checks will never stop; (2) creating unsustainable lifestyles; 3) buying houses the size of Texas; 4) diamonds and automobiles seem to be the favorite consumables; 5) risky and sometimes even inane \u201cinvestments,\u201d such as inflatable furniture rafts, sonic rays, music labels, nightclubs, T-shirt companies, cosmetic procedures and Ponzi schemes; 6) a chronic misallocation of investment dollars into nonliquid assets and private equity deals; 7) misplaced trust and agent mismanagement; 8) granting powers of attorney; 9) divorce and paternity actions; and 10) supporting enablers.\u201d[3] Addi",

It\u2019s about more than just fair play on the field; it\u2019s about trust, community, and the assurance that every dollar contributed is used to enhance the experience for young athletes. However, recent reports underscore persistent issues that jeopardize this trust. A stark example of this is the recent case involving a minor hockey team, where a team manager has been charged after allegedly embezzling funds meant for the team\u2019s expenses. Youth sports organizations depend greatly on volunteers, not just for coaching, but also for team management and financial oversight. While most volunteers are honest and have good intentions, there will always be a small percentage who may be tempted to take advantage of their position for personal gain. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first or the worst case of embezzlement in minor hockey. In 2021, a woman pleaded guilty to stealing over $2 million from a minor hockey association and was sentenced to 48 months in prison and $100,000 in restitution. The theft was only identified after authorities received a tip about the missing funds. Earlier this year, a junior hockey club fell victim to $50,000 in theft by their former treasurer, which was flagged by the club\u2019s financial institution. And in 2020, a minor hockey association in Newfoundland was defrauded over $75,000 by a volunteer treasurer. If this occurs more frequently than we realize, what measures can organizations take to prevent it? In addition to implementing dual signing authorities on team accounts and other financial controls, a confidential tipline can provide an added layer of security. In many cases, someone knows about the fraud or embezzlement but is afraid to say anything due to sports politics or fear of retribution. By offering a confidential reporting mechanism, individuals can come forward without fear and organizations can take swift action to address an",

Written by Theressa Jabbour Header & Thumbnail photo by Dave Adamson Professional athletes often have very high salaries, especially when they are competing at the highest levels of sport. Whether through salary earnings or brand deals, sports such as basketball, football (soccer), American football and golf lead the figures in best paying disciplines.\u00a0 In 2023, Forbes reported that out of the 50 top earning athletes in the world, 15 were basketball players in the NBA, 12 were golfers, 10 were American football players in the NFL, 6 were football players, with auto racing, boxing and tennis having two players each, and baseball rounding out the list with one player. Portuguese football player Cristiano Ronaldo tops the list with 136m USD of total earnings last year, with former American football player Tom Brady claiming number 50 with 45.2m USD of total earnings.\u00a0 However, despite the greatness of these numbers, many professional players often find themselves in financial trouble at some point during or after their professional career. An article by Sports Illustrated in 2009 highlights the long-standing commonality of this occurrence in major sports. Within 2 years of retirement, a reported figure of 75% of NFL players find themselves in financial trouble. The numbers for NBA players are similar, with 60% of players going broke within 5 years of leaving the sport. In 2022, Fox Business reported that 78% of professional athletes lose their wealth after barely 3 years into their retirements. Photo by Josh Appel\u00a0on Unsplash There are several reasons for this. One, is financial mismanagement. Professional athletes reach the big leagues at a relatively young age, leaving them with little to no opportunity to learn the best ways to manage their money.

We witness their triumphs on the field, the court, or the track, and we admire the opulent lifestyles they lead. However, behind the glitz and glamour lies a startling truth that has left many athletes in financial ruin. This is the story of why so many athletes, despite earning millions during their careers, find themselves facing bankruptcy. Part I: The Rollercoaster Ride of Fame and Fortune The journey begins with the meteoric rise to fame. Athletes, young and talented, sign lucrative contracts and endorsement deals, catapulting them into the elite echelons of society. The allure of unimaginable wealth and a lifestyle that mirrors the dreams of many is too enticing to resist. However, the reality is that the careers of professional athletes are often fleeting. According to a study conducted by Sports Illustrated, the average NFL career lasts only 3.3 years, and the average NBA career lasts 4.8 years. With such a limited time in the spotlight, athletes face the challenge of managing their finances wisely for the long term. Part II: The Allure of Extravagance Once the money starts pouring in, the pressure to maintain an image of success and opulence intensifies. Athletes, surrounded by a culture that celebrates excess, are prone to overspending on luxurious homes, high-end cars, and extravagant lifestyles. ESPN reports that 60% of NBA players go broke within five years of retiring from the league, highlighting the alarming trend of financial mismanagement. Part III: The Invisible Tax Burden Taxes are another formidable opponent in the battle for financial stability. A",

(L-R) Dennis Rodman (image via Instagram, @dennisrodman), Delonte West (image via Instagram, @dluckyleftywest), and Lawrence Taylor, image via Instagram, @lawrencetaylor56) NFL great Terrell Davis recently shared a horror story about being misled and swindled by an adviser, who was recommended by a friend, who mismanaged his accounts, losing him a lot of money early in his career. His story is not uncommon, as many athletes come from backgrounds where they\u2019ve never had to manage large sums of money, and without proper guidance, they can fall prey to extravagant lifestyles, risky investments, and even unethical advisors. The unpredictable nature of sports careers, combined with the pressure to uphold a certain image, often leads to reckless spending, making them vulnerable to financial collapse once their playing days come to an end. The situation is dire for some athletes, who experience not just hiccups in their investment portfolios but total financial ruin after once basking in the glory of substantial earnings.

NBA Stars Speak Out Andre Iguodala and Kevin Garnett have raised concerns about NIL deals. Iguodala believes that early financial rewards from NIL can disrupt young players' development by reducing their motivation to improve. Garnett agrees, highlighting the potential for these deals to inflate egos and make players less coachable. While NIL deals can be lucrative, here are some potential pitfalls to be cautious of: Eligibility Risks: As highlighted by the GHSA, accepting money from the wrong sources can jeopardize your eligibility. Always ensure your deals comply with the rules set by your school or athletic association. Tax Implications: Earnings from NIL deals are taxable. If you\u2019re not careful, you might end up with a hefty tax bill. Make sure to set aside a portion of your earnings for taxes and consult with a tax professional. Financial Mismanagement: Sudden income can be tempting to spend. Without proper financial planning, you might find yourself in financial trouble. Consider hiring a financial advisor to help manage your money wisely. Ego and Complacency: As Iguodala and Garnett pointed out, early financial success can lead to complacency. Stay grounded and focused on improving your skills and performance. Brand Reputation: Aligning with the wrong brands c",

Since then, countless sponsorship, marketing, and other financial opportunities for student athletes \u2013 at all levels of college sports \u2013 have arisen, which caused a dramatic shift in the collegiate athletics arms race. Although NIL rules specifically prohibit offering deals to recruits as an inducement, commonly known as \u201cpay for play,\u201d the amount of money an athlete can earn by attending a particular school has become a powerful recruiting tool that will continue to increase in importance as more lucrative deals for top athletes are announced. As such, the shifting landscape has led wealthy fans and former athletes alike to organize companies, otherwise known as \u201cCollectives,\u201d intended to raise money and offer financial opportunities to student athletes with the goal of enticing athletes to attend their school. While these Collectives can be advantageous for student-athletes and the schools they are intended to benefit, they are also at risk of running afoul of new NIL laws and university rules and regulations. What are five potential risks Collectives should note? Joint Employer LiabilityUnder the NCAA\u2019s interim policy, student athletes are permitted to sign endorsement deals and profit from marketing and advertising campaigns for third parties. As such, Collectives typically partner with local or national companies to provide opportunities for student athletes, which can potentially subject a Collective to liability as a joint employer. Joint employers must comply with various federal, state, and l",

Since the NCAA allowed college athletes to profit from their NIL in 2021, the ripple effects of this decision have extended beyond collegiate sports and are now reshaping the high school sports arena. High school athletes, especially those with high visibility and potential future stardom, are seeing opportunities to monetize their personal brand at younger ages. But what does this mean for these young athletes, their families, and the sports ecosystem at large? Let's explore below: 1. A New Avenue for Income While we typically associate college athletics with NIL, high school athletes (in many states, including California) with large followings on social media or exceptional athletic talent are now in a position to secure endorsement deals, monetize social media platforms, and sign with marketing agents. For many, this means a potentially life-changing financial opportunity. For instance, standout athletes in popular sports like basketball, football, and gymnastics may now sign lucrative deals with brands even before stepping foot on a college campus. This influx of income can ease financial pressures for families, cover training costs, or provide savings for future education. For athletes who might not pursue college or professional sports, NIL offers a chance to capitalize on their brand at its peak. It also opens up entrepreneurial opportunities, allowing these young athletes to learn about branding, business, and marketing from a young age. 2. Increased Pressure and Expectations While the prospect of NIL income is enticing, it also introduces new pressures. High school athletes are not only competing for scholarships and championships but also for marketability. Some might feel the need to manage their online personas, grow their social media followings, and cultivate a polished brand image\u2014b",

A Study in Pro Sports Never Done Before The frauds against professional athletes over the past two decades is well-worn territory. The athlete fails to identify the fraud for years, the fraud then becomes publicized due to a lawsuit or federal investigation, the internet gets their clicks, and no solution is provided.

Until now. Summary of Findings BrightLights studied 26 professional athletes across the four major sports who have been defrauded $1 million or more in the past decade. This sample consisted of nine NFL players, nine NBA players, four NHL players, and four MLB players 1. In total, the 26 athletes were defrauded $342 million, ranging from $1.2 million to $77 million and a median of $10 million. The average fraud cost athletes$13.1 million. The average age of the athletes when the fraud began was 28 years old (ranging from 20 to 44 years old with a median age of 28). The average age of the athletes when the fraud was discovered was 34 years old (ranging from 22 to 53 years old with a median age of 32.5).

He put it thus: For decades, student athletes, usually 17-to-19 year-old freshmen, have informally agreed to a contract with the universities they attend:\u00a0 athletic performance in exchange for an education. The athletes have kept their part of the bargain; the universities have not. Universities and athletic departments have gained huge gate receipts, television revenues, national visibility, donors to university programs, and more as a result of the performances of gifted basketball and football players, of whom a disproportionate number of the most gifted and most exploited have been Black (p. 373). Edwards, Harry. 1985. \u201cEducating Black athletes.\u201d Pp. 373-384 In D. Chu, J. 0. Segrave & B. J. Becker (Eds.), Sport and higher education. Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics. We believe that anyone writing about student-athletes and the struggle with the issues\u00a0 of the exploitation of the Black Student-Athlete at Predominantly White Institutions should take a seat now as this blog is long (Van Rheenen, Derek 2011). These student-athletes, mostly men, who play basketball and football, the question goes, should they be compensated for their time on the athletic field? The first question is what is exploitation of a student athlete?\u00a0 Many disagree. In 2016 the Pac-12 Commissioner Larry Scott (makes $3.4 million) and Val Ackerman, also white (making about $500, 000) \u2014 co-published an editorial on CNN.com.\u00a0 arguing under a headline reading \u201cCollege Athletes Are Educated, Not Expl",

Further, the focus on becoming a professional athlete takes time away from learning the tools needed to survive in an economically driven society, regardless of whether or not the student-athlete makes it to the professional leagues.

To address these issues and uphold the integrity of the game, Sports KYC and Athlete KYC are emerging as crucial initiatives. Let's delve into these concepts, their significance in youth sports, and the compliance requirements surrounding them. Understanding Sports KYC: Sports KYC is Know Your Customer for the sports betting industry, focusing on verifying the identity of customers placing bets. This process is vital for several reasons: Compliance:\u00a0Regulatory bodies in jurisdictions with legalized sports betting often mandate KYC measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Fraud Prevention:\u00a0KYC helps identify and prevent fraudulent activities like using stolen identities or engaging in suspicious betting patterns. Responsible Gambling:\u00a0Age and location verification ensures minors and individuals from restricted areas cannot participate in betting. Risk Management:\u00a0Understanding customer profiles allows operators to assess and manage financial risks associated with high-rollers or suspicious activity. Sports KYC involves: Customer Identification:\u00a0Collecting basic information like name,\u00a0address,\u00a0date of birth,\u00a0and contact details. Document Verification:\u00a0Requiring government-issued IDs,\u00a0utility bills,\u00a0or other documents to confirm identity and address. Source of Funds Verification:\u00a0In specific cases,\u00a0platforms may need to verify the source of a customer's funds to ensure legality. Ongoing Monitoring:\u00a0Implementing systems to detect suspicious activity or changes in customer profiles.

The incentives are clear; the European football market alone is worth a staggering \u00a325 billion, and its main assets are young athletes in vulnerable positions (Deloitte, 2019). Recent years have seen a growing number of investigations into the widespread illicit practice of underage child recruitment in defiance of industry rules. However, without rigid adherence to these provisions, and given the existence of loopholes in the frameworks themselves, children under the age of 18 are being thrust towards bargaining tables at which they have little negotiating power or competence. Underage recruitment in professional football The informal recruitment of minors to professional football teams is a longstanding issue within the sport. One of the game\u2019s flagship stars, Lionel Messi, is famed for having signed his first \u2018contract\u2019 on a napkin at the age of 13, informally committing him to a career with F.C.

It\u2019s about more than just fair play on the field; it\u2019s about trust, community, and the assurance that every dollar contributed is used to enhance the experience for young athletes. However, recent reports underscore persistent issues that jeopardize this trust. A stark example of this is the recent case involving a minor hockey team, where a team manager has been charged after allegedly embezzling funds meant for the team\u2019s expenses. Youth sports organizations depend greatly on volunteers, not just for coaching, but also for team management and financial oversight. While most volunteers are honest and have good intentions, there will always be a small percentage who may be tempted to take advantage of their position for personal gain. Unfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first or the worst case of embezzlement in minor hockey. In 2021, a woman pleaded guilty to stealing over $2 million from a minor hockey association and was sentenced to 48 months in prison and $100,000 in restitution. The theft was only identified after authorities received a tip about the missing funds. Earlier this year, a junior hockey club fell victim to $50,000 in theft by their former treasurer, which was flagged by the club\u2019s financial institution. And in 2020, a minor hockey association in Newfoundland was defrauded over $75,000 by a volunteer treasurer. If this occurs more frequently than we realize, what measures can organizations take to prevent it? In addition to implementing dual signing authorities on team accounts and other financial controls, a confidential tipline can provide an added layer of security. In many cases, someone knows about the fraud or embezzlement but is afraid to say anything due to sports politics or fear of retribution. By offering a confidential reporting mechanism, individuals can come forward without fear and organizations can take swift action to address an",

Financial distress refers to individuals who are simply unable to generate sufficient revenue to meet their financial obligations. Athletes who fail to plan for the future, who spend above their means or who do not save and invest, are likely to experience this at the latter parts of their careers or during the early years of their retirement. Examples of athletes who found themselves in financial trouble include household names, such as Mike Tyson, Dennis Rodman and Dorothy Hamill. Indicatively, research from the previous decade suggests that around 80% of NFL players go broke within the first three years out of the league, as reported by Forbes. Similar figures have been reported for NBA athletes too. In order to minimize the chances of finding yourself in financial trouble, you need to follow a few very simple steps. First and foremost, you need a budget that can help you ground yourself financially.

Unfortunately, far too often, children are maltreated and abused in a sporting environment, and this continues to go unchecked (Human Rights Watch, 2020; OHCHR, n.d.). This is for many reasons, such as the inability to recognize abusive relationships, and child athletes being ashamed or afraid to come forward (OHCHR, n.d.). Based on the international legal framework, States and sports organizations are required to deal with these human rights violations, however, this obligation is too often not upheld and therefore abuses still occur and go unchecked (OHCHR, 2018).

Nonprofit mismanagement refers to the improper handling of an organization\u2019s resources, operations, or governance, leading to inefficiencies, legal issues, or harm to the organization\u2019s reputation. Mismanagement can occur in various forms: Financial Mismanagement: Financial mismanagement in nonprofits refers to the misuse, misallocation, or mishandling of the organization's financial resources. Practices including poor budgeting, misuse of funds, lack of financial oversight can undermine the organization's ability to achieve its mission and can lead to legal and reputational issues. Examples include spending donations on non-program-related expenses or failing to maintain accurate financial records. Operational Inefficiencies: Nonprofit operational inefficiencies refer to areas where a nonprofit organization is not using its resources\u2014such as time, money, or personnel\u2014optimally.

That fourth case is set for a hearing Thursday before U.S. District Judge Charlotte Sweeney in Colorado who is considering the association\u2019s and conferences\u2019 request to have the matter transferred to California, where it likely would be folded into the cases moving toward settlement. Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week. The NCAA Board of Governors also must approve the deal. If the bid to move the fourth case to California is rejected, it could continue in Colorado. If that happens, the NCAA, the conferences and the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys in the cases seemingly headed toward settlement may have to deal with lawyers who wrote in a filing Tuesday evening that \u201cit seems likely\u201d that one of their plaintiffs \u201cwill opt out of any such settlement t",

Subject to the agreement\u2019s approval by a federal judge, schools would be able to directly pay their athletes, an extraordinary change for an association and member schools and conferences that had spent years and tens of millions of dollars in legal and lobbying costs fighting the idea. Under the settlement plan, there would be a damages of about $2.8 billion - most of which is to be paid to compensate current and former athletes who, for years, had been prohibited from getting paid for a variety of activities and accomplishments that now can result in significant cash. Within \u2013 and beyond \u2013 that, there are still many questions. Here is a look at some of those questions and where things stand with them. At least for now. What are the specifics of NCAA revenue plan with athletes? At its most basic level, the plan presumably set to being in 2025-26 academic year initially will guided by a cap of 22% of the combined total of certain revenues of Power Five conference schools. Among the revenues being counted for this are those from media rights deals, ticket sales and sponsorships. NCAA representatives said Thursday night the dollar amount for the cap is set to increase annually and would be re-set further, depending on whether the applicable revenues increase substantially (think, new or renegotiated TV contracts). It will be up to the schools to determine how they want to spread this money among their athletes. NCAA representatives said Thursday night the idea is to provide schools with flexibility. And school athletics officials already have been considering how to proceed. Asked recently whether his department has been planning internally for how it would adjust to revenu",

Further, the focus on becoming a professional athlete takes time away from learning the tools needed to survive in an economically driven society, regardless of whether or not the student-athlete makes it to the professional leagues.

In the past 15 to 20 years, there has been a dramatic increase in sports participation at a young age, which has offered numerous health benefits, including self-esteem, confidence, team play, fitness, agility, and strength. Children are playing sports at younger ages. This article assesses the long-term outcome of sports injuries in young athletes, with suggestions on how to prevent such injuries.

Sep 6, 2023 | Athletes & Financial Struggles By Vasilia Polycarpou, The Sports Financial Literacy Academy When thinking about the lifestyle of professional athletes, extravagant spending, lavish homes and luxury cars usually come to mind. With lucrative multi-million-dollar contracts, the impression of infinite wealth can be created. However, this is only an illusion, since there are numerous examples of famous professional athletes who found themselves breaking the bank, due to financial struggles. So why do so many athletes face financial struggles? To begin with, athletes\u2019 incomes can fluctuate, being rather unpredictable. Athletes usually have a limited earnings window, making most of their earnings at a young age, meaning that they need to accumulate wealth that will last beyond their playing years, within a short period of time, relative to other professions. This window can become even smaller with potential injuries which could end their careers unexpectedly. These could easily lead to financial instability if the right measures are not taken by the athlete early on in their career. A great example of an athlete who was forced to retire early despite his promising talent, is former NBA player Brandon Roy. Chronic knee injuries caused him to retire abruptly at the height of his career. The sudden wealth effect and its consequences can also prove to be financially damaging, with athletes\u2019 spending habits, lifestyle choices and finan",

Initially hailed as a progressive step towards athlete empowerment, NIL has gradually revealed a darker side, marked by financial imbalances and ethical dilemmas. As we witness the repercussions of money\u2019s influential role in collegiate athletics, it\u2019s crucial to revisit the fundamentals of NIL. While this article lays the groundwork by exploring the broad impact of NIL, subsequent pieces will delve deeper into the murky waters of shady deals and questionable practices that have emerged in its wake. The Genesis of NIL in College Sports NIL rights emerged from a long-standing debate within the NCAA about athlete compensation. Historically, college athletes were not permitted to profit from their personal brands, a policy many criticized as unfair given the revenue generated by college sports.

However, this newfound source of income at a young age also poses challenges.

This creates a void in resources tailored to their unique financial needs and presents an opportunity for providers to address this underserved market.

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

Rent-sharing in Modern College Sports Abstract Intercollegiate amateur athletics in the US largely bars student-athletes from sharing in any of the profits generated by their participation, which creates substantial economic rents for universities. These rents are primarily generated by men\u2019s football and men\u2019s basketball programs. We characterize these economic rents using comprehensive revenue and expenses data for college athletic departments between 2006 and 2019, and we estimate rent-sharing elasticities to measure how rents flow to women\u2019s sports and other men\u2019s sports and lead to increased spending on facilities, coaches\u2019 salaries, and other athletic department personnel. We rule out skill-upgrading of coaches as an alternative explanation of our results by focusing on head coach \u201cstayers\u201d using panel data on the identity of each football head coach in our sample. Using complete roster data for every student-athlete playing sports at these colleges in 2018, we find that the rent-sharing effectively transfers resources away from students who are more likely to be Black and more likely to come from poor neighborhoods towards students who are more likely to be White and come from higher-income neighborhoods. Having documented the existence of rent-sharing, we conclude with stylized calculations of a wage structure for college athletes using the collective bargaining agreements in professional sports leagues as a benchmark. We also discuss how our results help understand how universities have responded to recent threats to these rents arising from litigation, legislation, and the global coronavirus pandemic. I study questions in health economics and public economics. I received my PhD in Economics at Northwestern University in 2023 and will start as a data scientist at Walmart in the summer of 2023.

ByKevin Miller| The College Football Playoff National Championship trophy | Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports The world of NCAA athletics has changed dramatically over the past several years. NIL, the growing ease of use of the transfer portal, and seemingly never-ending changes to conference alignment and postseason tournaments has made things hard to follow for fans. This has been seen most in college football. The changes keep coming, too, as Thursday saw the long-expected announcement that revenue sharing was coming for college sports. According to reports from all over the sports media world, all five power conferences (yes, the Pac-12 still counts...for now) have agreed, in conjunction with the NCAA, on a revenue-sharing settlement that will affect payouts to past, present, and future collegiate athletes for the money that has been made, is being made, and will be made by utilizing the athletes\u2019 names, images, and likenesses. Plenty of details still have to be worked out before anything is finalized, but according to On3's Pete Nakos, NCAA member institutions will be able opt into a proposed plan to share $20 Million of revenue annually with the athletes at the school. How much will go to which players has not yet been determined, but Title IX is still a factor that must be consid",

However, beneath the surface of this celebrated sport lies a complex web of corruption that threatens its integrity. The commercialization of college basketball has introduced significant financial incentives, leading to unethical practices and exploitation of student-athletes. Recent scandals have brought these issues to light, raising questions about the moral compass guiding college basketball. This essay aims to explore the multifaceted nature of corruption in college basketball, examining its causes, manifestations, and potential solutions. By analyzing real-life cases and considering counter-arguments, this paper seeks to provide a comprehensive understanding of the corruption that plagues college basketball today. The Financial Incentives Behind Corruption The commercialization of college basketball has turned the sport into a multi-billion dollar industry, with lucrative broadcasting deals, sponsorship agreements, and merchandising opportunities. This influx of money has created significant financial incentives for universities, coaches, and even athletes, leading to a culture where winning is often prioritized over ethical considerations. One notorious example is the 2017 NCAA bribery scandal, where several prominent coaches were implicated in schemes to funnel money to recruits in exchange for their commitment to specific programs (ESPN, 2017). This case highlights how the pressure to secure top talent can lead to unethical behavior, as stakeholders are willing to bend or break rules to gain a competitive edge.

Over 50 rich people were arrested by the FBI for participating in an elaborate scheme involving falsifying test scores and bribing coaches at universities like the University of Southern California, the University of Texas and Georgetown to give their non-athletic children spots on Division I teams in order to guarantee their children admission. The sports involved were water polo, tennis, sailing, rowing, volleyball and soccer, sports that often slip under the radar (though, I\u2019d be remiss not to say that college volleyball is actually a pretty big deal). Some of the coaches involved have been fired, others put on leave. The tennis coach who allegedly participated in this scam during his time at Georgetown was fired back in December 2017 \u201cafter an internal investigation found he had violated university rules concerning admissions.\u201d He subsequently got another job at the University of Rhode Island \u2014 which has since put him on administrative leave.

In spite of NCAA rules and NCAA enforcement practices, this type of activity has occurred for decades.

Whether these \u00e2\u0080\u009cunder the table\u00e2\u0080\u009d payments ought to occur is a separate issue. Some believe it is unethical to pay a recruit because the money contributes to an intentional plot to circumvent well-known NCAA rules.

A subsequent university investigation found that the coach, Clem Haskins, not only broke National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules by making cash payments to players, he also told his team to mislead attorneys who were looking into the academic fraud.

Fans from all over the country root for their team\u2019s success and hope they will be the ones to take home the national championship each year. Increasingly, however, college sports have been in the public eye for a very different reason: corruption. The National Collegiate Athletics Association\u2019s (\u201cNCAA\u201d) Amateurism Rule, which prohibits student-athletes from receiving compensation, has contributed to this ongoing corruption. The NCAA insists upon its student-athletes remaining amateurs, even though its own rule is damaging the integrity of college sports. Players, coaches, and fans alike are yearning for change. Nevertheless, the NCAA does not waiver from its Amateurism Rule. If this corruption is to en",

But to many the term may seem so vague\u2026 what does it actually mean? Even as a former DI athlete, even I had questions about how revenue sharing will play a role in athletes lives and college sports as a whole. With the recent antitrust settlement paving the way for schools to share revenue with athletes, here are a few questions (and key things to know)\u00a0that might help you better understand revenue sharing and it\u2019s future impact on college sports. What Is Revenue Sharing? Revenue sharing refers to the distribution of profits generated by a business or organization among its stakeholders. In the context of college athletics, this means schools will share a portion of the revenue generated through athletics programs, such as from broadcasting rights, sponsorships, ticket sales, and merchandise, with their student-athletes. While this concept has long been part of professional sports, the move toward revenue sharing in college sports marks a significant shift from the traditional model, where athletes have primarily received scholarships and non-monetary benefits. Key Things to Know About Revenue Sharing in College Athletics A New Era for College Athletes. One of the biggest implications of revenue sharing is that it recognizes student-athletes as key contributors to the financial success of their institutions. Previously, college athletes were restricted to scholarships and other educational benefits. Now, they will be able to earn a share of the revenue generated by their performance. This marks a major shift, as student-athletes will be compensated in ways that more closely resemble professional athletes. It Could Lead to Increased Earnings for Athletes. Athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, could see significant financial benefits. These sports generate millions of dollars for colleges through TV ",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities. Con: Increased Financial Pressure on Schools Most athletic departments already operate on razor-thin budgets, and adding athlete compen",

Compensation can help address these inequities, allowing them to focus on both academics and athletics without financial stress\u200b.

In his article, Blue described the structural challenges surrounding the growing expenses in big-time college athletics. He noted three economic components that inform athletic directors\u2019 financial decisions: A non-profit organizational structure, zero-sum competition, and accelerating revenue. First, Blue highlighted the non-profit organizational structure of college sport. Athletic departments don\u2019t have owners looking for a return on investment, and thus, sport leaders are not inclined to operate with the goal of turning a profit. With this, economic decisions are informed based on college sport missions, supposedly things like athlete development, gender equity, academic primacy, and long-term sustainability. Financial decisions are also\u2014arguably predominantly\u2014based on winning. Thus, because college sport is a non-profit, when revenues continue to rise, as we\u2019re seeing right now, expenses simultaneously increase in order to achieve the mission(s). Second, Blue discussed college sports\u2019 zero-sum environment: One team or program must win, and thus, another must lose. The competitive and zero-sum design of intercollegiate athletics creates what Blue called \u201can insatiable desire for an athletics program to make investments that drive success in the competitive part of its mission.\u201d The drive to win thus increases departmental expenses. Third, Blue described the trend of accelerating revenues in college athletics, something other non-profit fields do not similarly experience. Once again, since the non-profit mission of college athletics is not to create return on investment or generate surplus revenue, as revenue accelerates, so too do expenses. He concluded these three factors pressurize expenses, increasing departmental spending. And because of the design of ",

Tom McMillen\u2014president, LEAD 1 athletic directors, former Rhodes Scholar, 11-year NBA career, former member of Congress. By Allen Paul and John LeBar with Foreword by Scott Hirko Impelled by runaway spending and rampant corruption, America's much-beloved games of college basketball and football are being threatened. The specter of billion-dollar sums being showered on coaches, voracious athletic directors, hordes of support staff and lavish comforts for fans has led to a near-deafening roar to pay the players. The injustice of such sums being amassed, in the main, from the labor of young men of color many of whom come from disadvantaged backgrounds cannot be justified; and yet, American society has allowed this intractable problem to fester for more than half a century. Lured by the glitter of untold riches, naive young players enroll year after year in colleges and universities expecting the ultimate reward of a highly paid career as a pro. Only a minuscule few will advance that far; even fewer will reap significant financial rewards. Instead of educating them, colleges and universities force them into full-time athletic jobs in which their labor is shamelessly exploited.Small wonder that outraged critics demand compensation for the players, but these same critics only present vague answers when asked how such a radical change would work. College Sports on the Brink of Disaster, first published as Marching Toward Madness and now newly updated, cites twenty-one reasons why the pro-pay position is wrong, among them the prospect that the player talent pool will be concentrated to even fewer rich schools; recruiting wars will lead to more frequent scandals; and the regulatory powers of ",

This \u201cpay to play\u201d scandal has fans facing a harsh reality that college sports may not be as innocent as they seem. To many, college basketball represents the essence of competition. People are enamored by Cinderella stories, believing that if a small, regional school can compete alongside a larger university with a national recruiting pool, anything is possible. Whether it was 8th seed Villanova defeating Patrick Ewing\u2019s top-ranked Georgetown in the 1985 championship game, or George Mason\u2019s magical run to the Final Four in 2006, everyone wants to see David defeat Goliath. Somewhere along the way, the Goliaths got greedy. Afraid of losing their Goliath status, corruption crept into college basketball. Coaches started yielding their power and do whatever it takes to win. To find corruption in college basketball, just follow the money. In a three-year investigation, the \u201cFBI probe focused on coaches being paid tens of thousands of dollars to steer NBA-bound players toward sports agents, financial advisers and apparel companies.\u201d[1] Assistant coaches from Auburn, Arizona, Oklahoma State, and USC were allegedly taking money to send players to certain agents and advisors. These coaches now face charges of \u201cbribery conspiracy, solicitation of bribes, honest services fraud conspiracy, honest services fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud, and Travel Act conspiracy.\u201d[2] Such charges could bring up to 80 years in jail time, [3] a far cry from the slap-on-the-wrist punishment that the NCAA usually gives.

Increasingly, however, college sports have been in the public eye for a very different reason: corruption. The National Collegiate Athletics Association\u2019s (\u201cNCAA\u201d) Amateurism Rule, which prohibits student-athletes from receiving compensation, has contributed to this ongoing corruption. The NCAA insists upon its student-athletes remaining amateurs, even though its own rule is damaging the integrity of college sports. Players, coaches, and fans alike are yearning for change.

Aug 26, 2020 | Special Themes By Anna Kyprianou, APC Sports Consulting Ltd Corruption is not something new in the world of sports. It has existed since the establishment of sports competitions. From the ancient Olympic Games where athletes were accepting bribes to lose the competition, to the most recent Russian Olympic Team doping scandal, to Calciopoli and to Football Leaks with the revealing of murky financial transactions in European football, corruption is evolving into a global public policy issue. According to Paoli and Donati (2013) corruption in sports arises in four trends; de-amateurization, medicalization, politicization and commercialization. Through this article I will try to identify what leads to corruption in sports and why athletes, coaches, agents and other sports officials fall into the trap of corruption. Sports, is a multi-billion dollar business and thus a lucrative one which makes it prone to corruption. A basic aspect of corruption in sports is that it is multifaceted and manifested in many ways. For instance, doping arises from the de-amateurization and medicalization. The dream to succeed and the developments in medicine and its techniques led to athletes looking for ways to enhance their performance to win a medal in the Olympics or a trophy in a competition. Athletes that compete at the top-level keep searching for ways to get an edge over their competitors in order to achieve glory, success, respect and money. The doping phenomenon is more common when it comes to the ",

Offering a playbook to effectively tackle crime and corruption in sports by setting out a range of concrete policy considerations, the Global Report on Corruption in Sport also reveals the staggering scale, manifestation, and complexity of corruption and organized crime in sport at the global, regional, and national levels. Developed in partnership with nearly 200 experts from across governments, sport organizations, the private sector, academia, and related stakeholders, it is the most in-depth review of its type to date. While corruption in sport is not a new phenomenon \u2013 fraudulent activities in the running of sports institutions and competitions have been documented from the times of the ancient Olympic Games \u2013 the past two decades have witnessed a substantial increase in criminal activities within this area. Indeed, globalization, a huge influx of money, the rapid growth of legal and illegal sports betting, and technological advances transforming the way sport is played and consumed are making it increasingly attractive to criminal networks seeking to exploit sport for illicit profit. Against this backdrop, the Global Report breaks down an extensive range of issues, analysing the role of illegal betting, competition manipulation, abuse in sport, the susceptibility of major sporting events to corruption, and the involvement of organized crime, among others. It also highlights the changing landscape of sport and its relation to corrupt practices, the existing initiatives to tackle the problem, issues related to detecting and reporting wrongdoing, as well as how existing legal frameworks can be applied to address corruption within this area.

While some literature analyses the general governance concerns faced by these organizations, there is limited focus on anti-bribery and corruption (\u201cABC\u201d) within this sphere. This paper's research aim is an exploratory evaluation of the ABC best practice policies that exist within ISGBs, asking how they can be assessed and what best practice policies currently exist within this framework. This paper undertakes a critical review of the diverse ABC governance policies in the largest ISGBs through content analysis on governance documents publically available on the sample ISGB websites. This review was undertaken twice on the same ISGBs, in 2017 and 2020, and the changes reviewed. The research highlights best practice policies for recommendation to all ISGBs, and illuminates the absence of adequate policies with regards to the risk of bribery in ISGBs. The findings show there was no area within the framework that ISGBs performed well at as a collective, and there was no single ISGB whose anti-bribery policies were strong in all areas. However, the comparison between 2017 and 2020 shows an improvement in ABC policies in some ISGBs over the timeframe analyzed. The implications are a need for sharing best practice in this area of governance, and providing global guidance on ABC policies for ISGBs to ensure integrity in the sector. Introduction Bribery in sport is not an uncommon phenomenon. From boxer Eupolos bribing fellow Olympic Games competitors in 388 BC (Spivey, 2012), to bookmakers bribing stable-boys to dope horses in the 1960s (Reid, 2014), to FIFA Executive Committee members being bribed to secure their votes (Blake and Calvert, 2015; Conn, 2018), sport is awash with examples of this form of corruption.

                  "raw_content": "Amateurism in College Sports: An Evolutionary Tale from Past to Present Amateurism in college sports has been an integral part of the collegiate athletic landscape for over a century. The concept of amateurism in the context of college sports is primarily defined and enforced by the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). The NCAA establishes eligibility requirements that student-athletes must meet to maintain their amateur status and compete in college athletics. Amateurism is closely related to eligibility for athletes- to participate in college sports student-athletes must maintain their amateur status, which means they cannot receive compensation beyond the value of their scholarships and related educational expenses. If a student-athlete were to accept payment for their athletic performance or endorsements, they risk losing their eligibility to compete in NCAA-sanctioned events. Increased Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) opportunities for student-athletes could potentially challenge the current definition of amateurism. As NIL rights expand and athletes have more opportunities to profit from their image and likeness, it blurs the line between amateur and professional status. While the NCAA has introduced NIL regulations to allow student-athletes to benefit from their NIL rights, concerns arise about whether these changes could ultimately lead to a reevaluation of the traditional concept of amateurism in college sports. The Birth of Amateurism: Early Roots in College Sports The roots of amateurism in college sports can be traced back to the late 19th century when collegiate athletics first began to take shape in the United States.\u00a0 College athletics in the United States finds its origins in the 19th century when informal sports activities like rowing and track and field gained popularity among students. However, it wasn\u2019t until the late 19th century that organized and intercollegiate competitions started to formalize.

While some argue this shift provides much-needed financial opportunities, many believe that the potential for corruption, inequality, and distraction within college athletics outweighs its benefits. Concerns are rising about how these deals disproportionately favor certain sports and athletes, particularly football and basketball, leaving others behind.

Plenty of details still have to be worked out before anything is finalized, but according to On3's Pete Nakos, NCAA member institutions will be able opt into a proposed plan to share $20 Million of revenue annually with the athletes at the school.

This contradictory business model creates inherent tensions and ethical issues. Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, as revenues grow, the NCAA faces escalating scrutiny around fairness and rights for student-athletes. Restricting Athlete Payment NCAA rules strictly limit student-athletes receiving compensation beyond academic scholarships. Paying salaries or endorsements deals would supposedly erode amateurism. However, critics argue these restrictions exploit players who generate huge revenues without receiving direct benefits. Many demand student-athletes get their fair share of the financial pie. Acquiring an Education Supporters counter that scholarships facilitating an education are the appropriate reward, not income. Sports should primarily broaden college access. Statistics show college athletes often underperform academically and lack resources. Reform should address subpar graduation rates and academics. Paying salaries would only divert focus further from education. Time Commitments Practices, training, film study and travel leave little time for classwork or typical student life. Athletes sacrifice enormously for sports. The NCAA recently began allowing compensation for name, image and likeness rights, but balancing business demands with academics remains a predicament. College sports consume student-athletes. Health and Safety Policies inadequately address the physical demands placed on unpaid amateur players. Long-term healthcare is limited for injured athletes. Concussions and chronic injuries create lifelong health issues",

Let\u2019s embark on this journey through the world of college athletics, starting with the NCAA\u2019s remarkable road to recovery after the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 The NCAA\u2019s Road to Recovery Post-Pandemic In 2020, the NCAA grappled with the harsh financial realities of the COVID-19 pandemic, estimating a staggering $800 million loss in revenue due to the cancellation of March Madness and other sports events. However, just two years later, the NCAA reported an impressive rebound, with a revenue of $1.14 billion across the 2021-\u201922 collegiate seasons. Factors Fueling Financial Growth Here, we dissect the pivotal factors that have fueled this remarkable financial growth, including television rights, technological advancements, and the commercialization of college sports. Television Rights: Expanded Deals and Increased Rates Networks have continued to place a high value on live sports, and college sports has certainly benefited from this. We continue to see conference television contract values climb higher and higher. Diverse Broadcasting Platforms The rise of streaming platforms and over-the-top (OTT) services has increased the avenues through which audiences can consume live sports. The NCAA and conferences hae tapped into these new mediums, expanding their reach and consequently their revenue. Technological Advancements: Virtual Experiences The pandemic forced many organizations to innovate, and college athletics have been no exception. With limited in-person attendance, institutions leveraged technology to provide virtual experiences, ranging from virtual stadium tours to interactive online fan zones.

College athletics impacts the lives of its athletes, the fans, and the communities surrounding the schools. College athletes' and traditional students' extracurricular activities differ greatly based on a variety of factors, such as the NCAA's rules and regulations. The significant hours and revenues generated by student athletes' extracurricular activities have created the discussion of compensation for student-athletes. There are many ethical arguments in the debate to pay student-athletes, such as the vast pay differences and benefits that coaches receive and the amount of money that universities generate from student-athletes' work. There is also a legal argument in compensating student-athletes based on whether or not a college athlete meets the legal definition of an employee of the university. After analyzing the different ethical and legal issues of the debate, I calculate a revenue- sharing option and a wage option for student-athletes compensation. In order to examine the likely impact that compensation would have at various levels of the NCAA, the schools I analyzed are Ohio State University, the University of Houston, and South Dakota State University, and the sports I used are football, men's and women's basketball, and volleyball. Based on my research, smaller schools' athletics departments would need to make significant changes to their budgets in order to compensate their athletes because their athletics department's net income is negative. There is still more work to be done discussing the ethical and financial implications of paying student-athletes and the impact it would have on ",

Mia R. \u201926 This case study asks the question of whether or not college athletes should be compensated for their contribution to their schools athletic programs? Some key points brought up in the case consist of, the effects that being an athlete has on college students, which individuals are receiving the money brought in by athletes, and the attempts that colleges make to compensate athletes. The case mentions that athletes are being restricted from receiving compensation, however the NCAA receives profits. Although some students receive scholarships, students bring in a lot more money than they receive. When you take these factors into consideration you can use different ethical frameworks to come to an ethical decision. The first ethical framework I used to analyze this case is utilitarianism. When viewing this case from an utilitarian perspective, you would believe that college athletes should be compensated, as well as, the NCAA. A utilitarian should choose the action which benefits the most people overall. By paying athletes they would become more motivated to play, and would perform better. At the same time the NCAA would still receive money. In turn more people would be benefited. The NCAA would be receiving less money if athletes are given salaries,\u00a0 however according to the standard of utilitarianism happiness is defined by the amount of people who are happy and not the amount of happiness one person has. If college athletes did not receive salaries for their time and effort only the NCAA would gain happiness while the athletes would not. Therefore, an utilitarian would believe that college athletes should also receive compensation. I believe that student athletes should be compensated.\u00a0 Compensating student athletes woul",

NCAA settlement agreement filed last week. Instead, there are several thousand: the athletes themselves. The landmark settlement -- still awaiting final approval in court -- formalizes schools compensating athletes for their on-field talents. It's OK to say it out loud: Pay for play has arrived. Actually, pay for play is here against the will of some of those who opposed it. Deal with it.\u00a0 \"That is something that for over 100 years they fought desperately,\" said Jim Cavale, founder of Athletes.org, a college athletes association. \"You can pull tons of statements from coaches, ADs, commissioners and presidents saying that day would never come. Some of them are still active. And it's here. It's going to happen.\" But in what form? With a few days for the settlement implications to, well, settle, it's clear there is a giant hole in the 133-page document. Not one athlete was at the table with a voice when the deal was hammered out.\u00a0 Call it the NCAA's lingering paternalism mixed with plaintiffs' lawyers expertise at firing an arrow to the heart of the NCAA's model, but that's a hole too big to ignore. There is $20 billion in revenue sharing alone available for Power Four athletes over the next 10 years.\u00a0 \"You have a bunch of lawyers working with the NCAA without athlete involvement to sort of work out these issues,\" said sports law attorney and athlete advocate Maddie Salamone. \"Maybe athletes get in a room and they decide these are things they're in favor of and they're bargaining.

The structural uniqueness of the non-profit economic system of college sports calls for innovative business and legal solutions to curtail excessive spending and its associated problems, and ensure the long-term health of college athletics in the United States. \u00a0 For-Profit Business and Non-Profit Organizations \u00a0 A business exists to maximize income for its owners, while also maintaining a sense of corporate social responsibility to other stakeholders. On the other hand, a non-profit organization, such as a school or a charity, exists solely to execute its mission. \u00a0 Non-profit organizations do not have owners expecting a financial return, so their leaders do not operate with the goal of making a profit. Instead, financial decisions are guided by the primary objective of mission impact, while also being mindful of long-term investments and sustainability. \u00a0 Accordingly, when revenues increase for a non-profit organization, expenses tend to grow commensurately. New income is used by the organization to further pursue its mission, not to create profitable operating margins. For example, a food bank that receives a new large grant will expand to serve more disadvantaged people rather than keeping the money. The level of annual expenditures for a non-profit organization is generally determined by its anticipated annual revenues. \u00a0 Athletics Departments as Non-Profit",

These agreements allow student-athletes to profit from their personal brands, a shift that has sparked both excitement and concern. Finding effective ways to manage and improve NIL opportunities is crucial for ensuring fairness and sustainability in college athletics. As universities and athletes navigate this new environment, challenges have emerged, such as unequal compensation and regulatory issues. Many stakeholders are calling for clearer guidelines and equitable systems to support all athletes, not just those in high-profile sports.

Say\u2019s\u00a0Jared Kamrass, as revenues grow, the NCAA faces escalating scrutiny around fairness and rights for student-athletes. Restricting Athlete Payment NCAA rules strictly limit student-athletes receiving compensation beyond academic scholarships. Paying salaries or endorsements deals would supposedly erode amateurism. However, critics argue these restrictions exploit players who generate huge revenues without receiving direct benefits. Many demand student-athletes get their fair share of the financial pie. Acquiring an Education Supporters counter that scholarships facilitating an education are the appropriate reward, not income. Sports should primarily broaden college access. Statistics show college athletes often underperform academically and lack resources. Reform should address subpar graduation rates and academics. Paying salaries would only divert focus further from education. Time Commitments Practices, training, film study and travel leave little time for classwork or typical student life. Athletes sacrifice enormously for sports. The NCAA recently began allowing compensation for name, image and likeness rights, but balancing business demands with academics remains a predicament. College sports consume student-athletes. Health and Safety Policies inadequately address the physical demands placed on unpaid amateur players. Long-term healthcare is limited for injured athletes. Concussions and chronic injuries create lifelong health issues",

Strict limitations on player compensation in revenue-generating college sports such as men\u2019s football and basketball result in a transfer of resources away from student-athletes in those sports, who are more likely to be from lower-income households, to those in other sports. The student-athletes in the sports receiving subsidies are more likely to be from affluent backgrounds, according to research reported in Who Profits from Amateurism? Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports (NBER Working Paper 27734). Craig Garthwaite, Jordan Keener, Matthew J. Notowidigdo, and Nicole F. Ozminkowski examine the socioeconomic impact of collegiate rules that restrict player compensation to scholarships and living expenses. They find that the college football and basketball players who are seen on network television capture less than 7 percent of the revenues they generate. Their professional counterparts receive about 50 percent of the revenues from their sports. By compensating college players at levels below what they could command in an unfettered market, athletic departments realize economic rents that are used to subsidize non-revenue-generating sports \u2014 other sports that would otherwise earn negative net income \u2014 to pay the salaries of coaches and other administrative personnel, and to build sports facilities. The study focuses on schools where most athletic department revenue is generated by ticket sales, media contracts, and promotional deals, primarily from football and basketball.

Rent-Sharing in Modern College Sports Intercollegiate amateur athletics in the US largely bars student-athletes from sharing in any of the profits generated by their participation, which creates substantial economic rents for universities. These rents are primarily generated by men\u2019s football and men\u2019s basketball programs. We characterize these economic rents using comprehensive revenue and expenses data for college athletic departments between 2006 and 2019, and we estimate rent-sharing elasticities to measure how rents flow to women\u2019s sports and other men\u2019s sports and lead to increased spending on facilities, coaches\u2019 salaries, and other athletic department personnel. Using complete roster data for every student-athlete playing sports at these schools in 2018, we find that the rent-sharing effectively transfers resources away from students who are more likely to be black and more likely to come from poor neighborhoods towards students who are more likely to be white and come from higher-income neighborhoods. To understand the magnitude of the available rents, we calculate a wage structure for college athletes using the collective bargaining agreements in professional sports leagues as a benchmark. We also discuss how our results help understand how universities have responded to recent threats to these rents arising from litigation, legislation, and the global coronavirus pandemic.

Pending remaining approvals \u2014 including approvals from the courts \u2014 such a consolidation would smooth the NCAA\u2019s path to finally resolving a set of cases that began in June 2020, but are rooted in litigation that has had the NCAA on edge for 15 years due to the continuing efforts of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers Steve Berman, and, more recently, Jeffrey Kessler. Earlier Tuesday, lawyers on both sides of the three cases seemingly headed toward settlement expressed confidence to USA TODAY Sports that they will prevail on having the fourth case moved to California. Meanwhile, the ACC and Big 12 both voted Tuesday to approve the proposed legal settlement, according to ESPN. The other three remaining Power Five conferences will vote later this week.

Key Changes and Impacts Explained Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 19, 2024 College Football The landscape of college athletics is undergoing a significant change. The new NCAA rule allows for direct payment to student-athletes, marking a shift from traditional amateurism. This introduces a new era where athletes can be compensated for their contributions, addressing ongoing debates about fairness and equity in sports. With the NCAA\u2019s push to amend its rules, student-athletes can now benefit from their names, images, and likenesses (NIL) in ways previously prohibited. This is a crucial development for those who compete in high-revenue sports like college football and men\u2019s college basketball. The decision directly affects how universities approach recruitment and athlete support, paving the way for a more equitable system. As this rule takes effect, it raises questions about the balance of power in college sports. Many wonder how this cha",

Athletes need to know their options 3-minute read This spring, the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the \"power five\" college athletic conferences agreed to a settlement that would allow colleges to pay athletes directly for the first time in the history of college sports.\u00a0The agreement, part of a class-action suit known as House v. NCAA, will end the tradition of amateurism in college sports.\u00a0In the past, recruiting scandals involving gifts of cars, houses and under-the-table financial compensation have been the height of controversy, and the definition of amateurism has significantly shifted thanks to legislation that has allowed student-athletes to profit from the use of their name, image and likeness, or NIL. Now we see the tides shift even more, as the House v. NCAA settlement introduces the never-before-seen aspect of revenue sharing with student-athletes across the country, which could be set into effect as early as summer 2025. While this is an exciting idea to reward the very students who draw crowd attendance and profit to the universities, it leaves the universities with one crucial question in an attempt to avoid inevitable and highly contested litigation: Does Title IX apply to revenue sharing? The simple answer is yes.\u00a0Title IX is a federal law that prohibits schools that receive federal funds from discriminating based on sex in the course of the schools\u2019 programs or activities. In the context of university athletic programs, Title IX requires that universities provide equal opportunity based on sex. Equal opportunity in athletic programs is measured by a three-prong analysis.\u00a0First are the benefits, opportunities and treatment given to men\u2019s and women\u2019s teams; second is how a school awards athletic scholarships and financial assistance; and third is how a school is meeting students\u2019 athletic interests and abilities. In determining whether Title IX applies to revenue sharing, the second prong is the focus \u2014 that is, does compensation recei",

A recent NCAA settlement, which allows for revenue sharing of up to $20 million per year with athletes starting in 2025, does not address Title IX compliance specifics, leaving institutions to navigate these decisions independently. Title IX mandates that educational institutions receiving federal funding must ensure gender equity in sport, which includes equal opportunities, benefits, and financial aid based on sex.\u00a0 Schools must continue to offer equal athletic opportunities without discriminating in the provision of financial aid, Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for OCR, wrote in a statement to ESPN. She also emphasized that the principles of Title IX remain unchanged in the new environment, which allows student athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness.\u00a0 OCR did not specify whether the new revenue share would be categorized as financial aid, which traditionally requires proportional distribution based on roster spots. This ambiguity forces athletic departments to make potentially contentious decisions such as distributing revenue equally, which could undermine football recruiting competitiveness, or risk legal challenges by favoring male athletes. The lack of federal guidance adds complexity, as schools must avoid gender disparities in benefits and opportunities, regardless of the funding source. Universities are exploring different models, including channeling funds through third parties for endorsement deals, but must ensure these practices comply with Title IX requirements.\u00a0 Schools are awaiting clarity on these regulations, which might only come through future legal rulings or potential legislative action. In the meantime, they must balance compliance with gender eq",

Konstans Former Senior Vice President For over a century, student-athletes were not allowed to make money from their name, image or likeness (NIL) through sponsorship deals. Last year, those regulations unraveled thanks to a historic 9-0 Supreme Court ruling. Now that student-athletes are over a year into owning their NIL rights, we spoke with five all-stars to hear the latest developments in the business of college athletics. A brief history of NIL in college athletics Amateurism has been central to the National Collegiate Athletic Association\u2019s (NCAA) regulatory approach since its inception, including forbidding students to make money from their name, image or likeness (NIL). However, as college sports grew into a multi-billion-dollar industry, this tenet was increasingly questioned: Why should the athletes at the heart of the industry not benefit from their skill and dedication? On June 21, 2021, this all changed. The Supreme Court delivered a rare 9-0 ruling against the NCAA that meant it could no longer limit education benefits offered to student-athletes by academic institutions.

Prior to July 1, 2021, student athletes were prohibited from receiving compensation for the use of their name, image and likeness (NIL). This rule, publicly regarded as unfair, was put in place to protect the amateur status of those competing in college sports, while others, including coaches and schools, profited from athletes\u2019 NIL. After years of resisting changes to this rule, the NCAA finally capitulated as several states were poised to implement laws that would allow student athletes to receive NIL benefits. These new laws came about thanks in part to a lawsuit filed by former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon claiming damages from a video game producer who profited from his NIL. With this new era comes tremendous opportunities, challenges and responsibility for student athletes and the schools they play for. Access to NIL opportunities is the first step in a long-awaited process to pay college athletes a share of the revenue generated by mega media deals derived from some, but not all, college sports. Of the more than 30 sports sponsored by the NCAA (USC has 21), only men\u2019s basketball and football turn a profit. These two sports, which typically underwrite athletic department budgets including Olympic sports, are made up of more than 80% young Black men, often from low-income backgrounds. Now that NIL is allowed, several student athletes have landed five- and six-figure endorsement deals, and some choose to use their NIL platforms to leverage community service and social justice initiatives. The challenges associated with NIL include avoiding illegal inducement of potential student athletes and navigating the mental health concerns stemming from managing yet another demand on student athletes\u2019 time and self-image. As expected, NIL has quickly become a means to attract recruits to attend a particular college, even though the new rules expressly prohibit",

In this guide, we provide recommendations for the before, during, and after of an NIL deal. Phase 1: Preparation For NIL Deals Before college athletes begin exploring opportunities to monetize their NIL, they should take the following steps to prepare: Building A Personal Brand To monetize their NIL rights, college athletes must first establish a strong personal brand. This means developing a reputation as a hardworking, dedicated athlete with a positive image. Athletes can build their reputation by participating in community service, staying out of legal trouble, and being a positive role model both on and off the field. They should also be mindful of their behavior on social media, as anything they post can have an impact on their reputation. Developing A NIL Strategy Once an athlete has established their personal brand, they should develop a NIL strategy that outlines their goals, target audience, and potential income streams. This will help them identify the types of NIL deals that align with their personal brand and goals. Vetting Service Providers College athletes should also research and vet potential service providers, such as agents, attorneys, and marketing firms, that can help them navigate the NIL rights process. It\u2019s important for athletes to work with professionals who have experience in the sports industry and understand the legal and financial considerations of NIL deals. Sourcing NIL Deal Opportunities College athletes should analyze their audience to understand what types of brands would be interested in partnering with them for NIL deals. Once they understand their value, athletes can proactively seek out NIL deals through intentional outreach and networking events. Local bus",

However, in addition to these often headline-catching deals, there has been considerable growth in both college-wide and team-specific deals. While these broader deals continue to evolve, and will hopefully prove beneficial to all involved, they are representative of how quickly the NIL landscape is shifting and underscore why institutions must continue to develop thorough NIL policies, apply them consistently and, in the case of athletic staff, boosters and student-athletes, provide training on NIL policies to help stave off compliance headaches. As it sounds, college-wide deals are those in which an institution enters into a collective licensing agreement with a company or brand that is available to most every varsity student athlete. The purpose, or benefit, of such deals is that each student-athlete can elect to participate, regardless of team or sport. This, of course, may be a particularly attractive way to highlight non-traditional athletic programs on campus. For instance, while The Ohio State University is well known for its powerhouse football team, its agreement with The Brandr Group now allows student-athletes on all 36 of its varsity sports programs to profit from their NIL. Practically speaking, this allows a student-athlete who opts-in to profit from their NIL in conjunction with Ohio State trademarks and its official licensees (think names on jerseys in the bookstore).1 Similarly, team-specific deals are those in which a company or brand makes a general offer to a specific team of an institution such that any student-athlete on that team can elect to participate by signing a NIL deal directly with the company or brand.

Players deserve compensation College sports brought in almost $19 billion in revenue in 2019, which is only about 0.02% the size of the entire world\u2019s GDP. It\u2019s a 260% increase from 10 years ago, and if current talks over conference media rights are any indication, it\u2019s going to continue increasing into the future.

LSU gymnast Olivia Dunne has leveraged a strong social media presence to bring in lucrative name, image and likeness deals. Alex Goodlett/Getty Images It\u2019s been two years since the National Collegiate Athletic Association established policies allowing college athletes to profit off of their name, image and likeness. The NCAA had argued for years that allowing athletes the same rights as every other student would ruin collegiate sports. Critics feared NIL would usher in a pay-to-play era, and many decried the early NIL landscape as a Wild West of unlimited possibilities\u2014and hidden dangers. Big-dollar deals made headlines early on. Former University of Alabama quarterback Bryce Young cashed in on deals with national corporations like Subway and Cash App and local companies, too, such as a BMW dealership in Tuscaloosa. Louisiana State University gymnast Olivia Dunne channeled millions of social media followers into agreements with companies such as American Eagle and GrubHub, among other sponsorships. College athletes collectively made an estimated $917\u00a0million from NIL payments in the first year, with the most lucrative deals flowing to football and men\u2019s basketball stars. NCAA Division\u00a0I athletes reportedly earned an average of $3,711 in the first year of NIL. While the long-feared death of college sports hasn\u2019t occurred, critics and supporters alike see problems on the horizon, particularly with a patchwork of state laws that provide more financial freedom for college athletes in some states than others.

By CLRN team / December 26, 2024 Should College Athletes be Paid? The debate on whether college athletes should be paid has been ongoing for years, with proponents on both sides presenting compelling arguments. In this article, we will delve into the pros and cons of the issue and provide a balanced perspective on the matter. Direct Answer: Should College Athletes be Paid? In our opinion, yes, college athletes should be paid. The current system, where athletes receive scholarships and \u00a0educational benefits, is not enough to compensate them for the value they bring to their universities and the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association). College athletes generate hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue for their schools and conferences, and it is only fair that they receive a portion of that revenue in the form of compensation. Watch live sports online Arguments For Paying College Athletes \u2022 Revenue Generation: College athletes are responsible for generating significant revenue for their universities and conferences. According to a study by the University of Michigan, the athletic department generated $144.4 million in revenue in 2019, with the football team accounting for over $100 million of that total. Basketball and football teams are the most valuable assets for many universities, and their success directly translates to increased revenue. \u2022 Exploitation: Critics argue that college athletes are being exploited by universities and the NCAA, who benefit financially from their talents while they receive little to no compensation. The current system is a form of indentured servitude, where athletes are expected to donate their time and energy to their universities without receiving a fair share of the revenue they generate. \u2022 Fairness: Many argue that paying college ath",

On one side of the debate, there are those who argue that college athletes, who dedicate a significant portion of their time and energy to their sport, should receive compensation for their efforts. On the other side, there are concerns about the potential consequences of such payments. In this essay, we will explore the arguments on both sides of the debate and consider potential solutions that could lead to a fairer system for college athletes. The Argument for Paying College Athletes Time and Commitment: College athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports like football and basketball, commit a substantial amount of time to their sport. Their demanding schedules often make it difficult to balance academics, work, and other activities. Paying these athletes could help alleviate financial stress and allow them to focus more on their studies. Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities generate enormous revenue from the success of their athletic programs, with coaches and administrators often earning significant salaries. This creates a perception that athletes are being exploited for their talent while receiving little in return. Injury Risks: College athletes face a higher risk of injury while competing. These injuries can have lifelong consequences, jeopardizing their future careers. Providing compensation could serve as a safety net in case of such misfortunes. Market Value: Some argue that college athletes are similar to young professionals in other industries who have a unique skill set. They suggest that athletes should be allowed to profit from their name, image, and likeness (NIL) through endorsements and sponsorships. The Argument Against Paying Co",

With the preliminary approval of the House vs. NCAA settlement, this landmark change could allow schools to start sharing revenue directly with athletes as early as 2025. While it\u2019s a step forward for fairness and athlete rights, it\u2019s not without its complexities. Let\u2019s dive into the pros and cons of this monumental shift. Pro: Athletes Finally Get a Fair Share For years, college athletes have been the driving force behind multimillion-dollar TV deals, ticket sales, and merchandise revenue. Yet, they\u2019ve often been compensated only with scholarships and stipends. Revenue sharing ensures athletes are rewarded financially for their contributions, especially in revenue-heavy sports like football and men\u2019s basketball. This shift acknowledges their role as more than just students\u2014they\u2019re key players in a billion-dollar industry. Con: Could Widen the Gap Between Sports While football and basketball players stand to benefit the most from revenue sharing, athletes in non-revenue sports may see little to no financial impact. These smaller programs often rely on funding from the profits of larger sports, raising concerns about how schools will sustain non-revenue sports while also paying revenue sport athletes. This could exacerbate an already uneven playing field across programs. Pro: Improved Athlete Support and Incentives With revenue sharing, athletes might have access to more financial security, which could lead to improved focus on their academics and performance. The ability to earn directly from their efforts could also serve as an incentive for athletes to stay in school longer, rather than leaving early to pursue professional opportunities.

This dual pursuit of academic and athletic achievement is a hallmark of the collegiate experience, and it is often facilitated by the critical support of athletic scholarships. Scholarships play a pivotal role in attracting talented athletes to universities and colleges, providing them with the financial means to pursue higher education while dedicating significant time and energy to their sport. Athletic scholarships are not merely financial awards; they are a testament to an athlete\u2019s prowess and potential. They serve as a beacon for those who have excelled in their respective sports, signaling a commitment from educational institutions to invest in their future. For many student-athletes, these scholarships are the gateway to a college education that might otherwise be financially out of reach. They cover a range of expenses, from tuition and fees to room and board, easing the burden on students and their families. The pressure to perform academically while maintaining a high level of athletic performance is immense. Scholarships can alleviate some of this stress by ensuring that financial concerns do not become an additional hurdle. They allow athletes to focus on their studies and training, knowing that their educational costs are being met. This financial security can be a deciding factor in a student-athlete\u2019s choice of college, influencing their decision to attend a particular institution over another. Moreover, scholarships can enhance the overall college experience by providing access to resources and support systems that are tailored to the needs of student-athletes. These may include academic tutoring, athletic training facilities, and mental health services, all of which are designed to help athletes succeed in their dual roles. In e",

Numerous studies related to pay-for-play have been implemented, however, few have examined how student-athletes feel about the pay-for-play model. The purpose of this study will be to explore student-athletes\u2019 perceptions of pay-for-play. In order to understand student-athletes\u2019 perceptions of pay-for-play, a phenomenological research design was chosen. Three former and two current NCAA Division I student-athletes from Liberty University participated in the research. Each participant filled out a survey, completed an in-depth interview and participated in a focus group. The participants\u2019 results showed two were proponents of pay-for-play, two were neutral and one was an opponent of the model. The survey results showed no major commonalities were found amongst the subgroups of the student-athletes. The individual interviews and focus groups exposed the only commonality found amongst similar viewpoints was the personal research a participant has done about the pay-for-play model.

College coaches are usually one of the highest-paid state employees as well. Some basketball and gridiron football coaches earn salaries of more than $3 million per year. That means their wages are sometimes higher than their professional counterparts. If a school does well in a specific sport, then it may qualify for financial bonuses from a variety of institutions. Should student-athletes receive a portion of that since they earned it with their performance? On February 20, 2019, Zion Williamson had one of his shoes explode on him while playing basketball. The consensus best college athlete for the season and future #1 NBA draft pick suffered a sprained knee. If he were to step onto the court again, then he would be placing his future at risk while the college and the apparel company sponsoring the program stood to bring in millions of dollars of profit because of the exposure. There are several advantages and disadvantages to consider when looking at the idea of paying college athletes a stipend that goes beyond what they receive with their scholarship.

Scholarships might pay for books, tuition, and the other common costs of going to college, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay every expense that a student might have.

Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

By CLRN team / November 29, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not Get Paid: The debate about whether college athletes should be paid for their participation in sports has been ongoing for years. While some argue that athletes should be compensated for their talents, others believe that paying them would be unfair and potentially disrupt the delicate balance of college sports. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why college athletes should not be paid. The NCAA\u2019s Mission: To Provide Education, Not to Make a Profit The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit organization that governs collegiate athletics in the United States. The primary goal of the NCAA is to provide opportunities for student-athletes to balance their academic and athletic pursuits. The NCAA\u2019s mission is to \"improve the collegiate athletic experience\" by providing a framework for competition, promoting fair play, and ensuring safe environments for athletes. Not All Sports Are Created Equal: Emphasis on Scholarship Opportunities One of the primary arguments against paying college athletes is that scholarships provide a significant amount of compensation for many student-athletes. In fact, over 90% of all NCAA athletic scholarships are awarded to Division I football and men\u2019s basketball players. These scholarships cover tuition, room, and board, as well as other educational expenses, providing significantly more value to athletes in these sports. The Rise of Athletic Conference Schedules and Strength of Schedule The increasing number of athletic conference games and strength of schedule have also raised concerns about the potential for exploitation. For example, C__Oliver, a senior at the University of Louisville, made a strong case for the NCAA\u2019s role in maintaining",

Hey! Curious to hear some thoughts on why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I'd like to consider different perspectives to form my own opinion. Thanks! 11 months ago Hello! It's important to consider various perspectives when thinking about whether college athletes should be paid or not. Here are a few common arguments against paying college athletes: 1. Amateurism: One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is preserving the spirit of amateurism in college sports. This means that student-athletes participate in sports for the love and passion they have for the game, not for financial gain. Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

Millions of eyes across the country will be tuning in to watch these amateur athletes, just as they did for the Men\u2019s Division I Basketball Tournament this last March. The NCAA reported $857 million of revenue from the 2018 March Madness tournament, and the association is estimated to have increased that amount to $1 billion in 2019.1\u00a0The players who make up this tournament and the upcoming college football season are the reason these are some of the most widely viewed sporting events of the year, but the athletes themselves barely get a paper-thin slice of the revenue they produce.

This law alarmed the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). According to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, NCAA officials called this law \u201charmful,\u201d \u201cunconstitutional,\u201d and an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to college sports. NCAA officials gathered in Georgia on October 29th, 2019, to discuss the matter and decide on a course of action after 20 other states considered adding laws that resembled California\u2019s. After debating the matter, they concluded that each division could establish rules for paying college athletes. Soon after, many states began allowing athletes to earn money for their sport. These new policies would go into effect on July 1st, 2021, though the NCAA wanted to eliminate these laws because college was supposed to be for amateurs. The NCAA believed this would hurt the league far more than it would help, so it decided to take action. The NCAA took this issue to the Supreme Court and lost.\u00a0 The U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the NCAA cannot restrict monetary benefits players may get from their likeness. On June 30th, 2021, the day before many states\u2019 new NIL (Names, Image, Likeness) laws would come into effect, the NCAA finally admitted defeat. There was nothing the NCAA could do to stop college athletes from making money. July 1, 2021, came around, and it took a little while for college athletes to sign endorsements and make money.\u00a0\u00a0 No matter what people think about college athletes getting paid, these new provisions have benefits. There were many concerns surrounding athletes\u2019 income previously, such as the possibility that only athletes participating in certain sports would receive benefits.\u00a0 However, according to ESPN, this has not been the case.

Dozens of sports provide opportunities for teens to earn scholarships so that they can pursue a degree while they play, but critics of this system say that isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t nearly enough compensation compared to what could go wrong. College coaches are usually one of the highest-paid state employees as well. Some basketball and gridiron football coaches earn salaries of more than $3 million per year. That means their wages are sometimes higher than their professional counterparts. If a school does well in a specific sport, then it may qualify for financial bonuses from a variety of institutions. Should student-athletes receive a portion of that since they earned it with their performance? On February 20, 2019, Zion Williamson had one of his shoes explode on him while playing basketball. The consensus best college athlete for the season and future #1 NBA draft pick suffered a sprained knee. If he were to step onto the court again, then he would be placing his future at risk while the college and the apparel company sponsoring the program stood to bring in millions of dollars of profit because of the exposure. There are several advantages and disadvantages to consider when looking at the idea of paying college athletes a stipend that goes beyond what they receive with their scholarship. List of the Advantages of Paying College Athletes 1. Paying athletes would eliminate the need for additional employment. Scholarships might pay for books, tuition, and the other common costs of going to college, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay every expense that a student might have. It is not unusual for athletes to find a job outside of their sport and classroom schedule so that they have some spending money to use. Some students don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify for a scholarship, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forced to pay their way while also participating in their sport as a walk-on. This proces",

The extension in 2016 followed a 2010 contract which offered a 14-year agreement to broadcast the annual tournament for $10.8 billion. The NCAA states that 90% of the revenues generated through the games played by student athletes go into services, programs, or direct distribution opportunities which directly benefit member conferences and schools. Aside from equipment access, medical care, scholarships, and travel support, student athletes receive zero compensation for their participation in their chosen support.By definition, paying the athlete would make them a professional. On the other hand, it could be argued that scholarships are an alternative form of payment already being provided. Because of the revenues their activities generate, the pros and cons of paying college athletes are closely scrutinized. List of the Pros of Paying College Athletes 1. It encourages healthier student athletes. Paying college athletes for their participation in sports eliminates the need for them to find outside employment to support themselves. Many scholarships may offer tuition, room, and board coverage in return for participating in a sport, but not every student athlete qualifies for a scholarship. Walk-on players have their images used to generate revenues for the NCAA too for zero compensation. Paying all athletes would allow them to focus on academics and athletics without worrying about making ends meet. 2. It provides relief for families. Families ",

AccountingInsights Team Published Jan 10, 2025 Athletic scholarships are a key financial resource for student-athletes, often covering tuition, fees, and other educational expenses. Understanding their tax implications is essential for students and families to avoid unexpected liabilities. As college costs rise, knowing which portions of an athletic scholarship are taxable can significantly impact financial planning. Taxable vs. Non-Taxable Scholarships When assessing the taxability of athletic scholarships, it\u2019s important to distinguish between taxable and non-taxable components. Under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 117, scholarships used for qualified education expenses, such as tuition and mandatory fees, are generally non-taxable. If an athletic scholarship is applied directly to these costs, the student-athlete typically does not incur a tax liability. However, scholarships covering non-qualified expenses like room and board, travel, and personal expenses are considered taxable income. For example, a stipend for living expenses must be reported as income on the student\u2019s tax return. Keeping detailed records of how scholarship funds are allocated is essential for accurate reporting. IRS Guidelines for Athletic Scholarships IRS guidelines emphasize that scholarships must be used for educational purposes to remain non-taxable. Amounts covering tuition, fees, books, supplies, and required equipment are excluded from taxable income. However, when funds are used fo",

With the current challenge from the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) against the state of California involving the removal of the amateurism rule, it is more relevant now than ever to look at what is involved in paying student-athletes and how it could impact the current landscape of college athletics. This paper will examine both the positive and negative impact of removing amateurism within college athletics and come to a final recommendation for all stakeholders.

There are several reasons given in support for both sides. Some rationales supporting the payment of student athletes include college athletes expenditure of time towards their sport\u2014an average of 43.3 hours per week, college athletes struggle to make ends meet, paying students would only make the sport more competitive, the money earned from athletics is not automatically reinvested in education and research, the college sports apparel market capitalizes specifically on these players, payment would help athletes leave school with a degree and little debt, and the NCAA is an $11 billion industry which should be able to afford paying people on all levels, including the players.. \u00a0 Common arguments against the payment of student athletes encompass a lack of college athletic programs to \u00a0afford to pay athletes, elite college athletes receive athletic scholarships which serves as a form of compensation, there is no fair way to pay college athletes, students are not professionals, paying student athletes will cause cuts elsewhere, and paying college athletes will ruin college sports. \u00a0 One of the major arguments used by the NCAA is the preservation of its amateurism model and the fact that the players are student-athletes. According to the NCAA, an amateur is a person that \u201cdoes not have a written or verbal agreement with an agent, has not profited above his/her actual and necessary expenses or gained a competitive advantage in his/her sport.\u201d There has been pushback and litigation against the NCAA and its resistance to pay student athletes.

There are a lot of myths and facts surrounding student-athletes receiving athletic scholarships. At the Division 1 level, only about 57% of the athletes receive financial aid, from book scholarships to full scholarships. The amount is slightly higher at the division 2 level at 63%. However, division 1 schools, on average, manage the largest athletic budgets that provide the most funding for athletic scholarships. The NCAA Division 1 and 2 schools provide more than $3.6 billion in athletic scholarships annually to more than 180,000 student-athletes. Only 2% of high school student-athletes are awarded athletic scholarships to compete in college. Full Athletic Scholarships Most athletes do not receive a full athletic scholarship. There is just over 1% of student-athletes who receives what is called a \u201cfull ride.\u201d A full-ride scholarship is an award that covers all expenses related to college which includes things like tuition, books, fees, room & board, and living costs. The goal is to remove any need for additional financial aid. A partial athletic scholarship will only cover a portion of those expenses needed to pay for college. An athletic scholarship may only cover a portion of fees like parking fines, single dorm room, dorm deposits, application fees, school ID, library fines, and late fees may not be covered. There are over 351 universities in D1 and 313 in D2 out of a total of 2,081 colleges in all divisions. Only 85 full-ride scholarships are available to NCAA D1 universities annually. The average athletic scholarship amount is around $18,000 per student. However, not eve",

College coaches are usually one of the highest-paid state employees as well. Some basketball and gridiron football coaches earn salaries of more than $3 million per year. That means their wages are sometimes higher than their professional counterparts. If a school does well in a specific sport, then it may qualify for financial bonuses from a variety of institutions. Should student-athletes receive a portion of that since they earned it with their performance? On February 20, 2019, Zion Williamson had one of his shoes explode on him while playing basketball. The consensus best college athlete for the season and future #1 NBA draft pick suffered a sprained knee. If he were to step onto the court again, then he would be placing his future at risk while the college and the apparel company sponsoring the program stood to bring in millions of dollars of profit because of the exposure. There are several advantages and disadvantages to consider when looking at the idea of paying college athletes a stipend that goes beyond what they receive with their scholarship. List of the Advantages of Paying College Athletes 1. Paying athletes would eliminate the need for additional employment. Scholarships might pay for books, tuition, and the other common costs of going to college, but they don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t pay every expense that a student might have. It is not unusual for athletes to find a job outside of their sport and classroom schedule so that they have some spending money to use. Some students don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t qualify for a scholarship, so they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re forced to pay their way while also participating in their sport as a walk-on. This proces",

The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), in a landmark agreement with five power conferences, has unveiled sweeping reforms set to redefine collegiate sports through comprehensive reforms in scholarship distribution and roster management.This major overhaul, driven by a $2.78 billion antitrust settlement, not only facilitates direct athlete compensation but also introduces significant changes to how scholarships and team rosters are structured across all NCAA sports.\u00a0(Whole Hog Sports)These changes, earmarked to commence in the 2025-2026 academic year, promise to reshape the governance and operational dynamics of college sports.Details of the SettlementFiled in the Northern District of California, the settlement stems from prolonged litigation challenging previous NCAA compensation rules. The agreement introduces new guidelines that replace traditional fixed scholarship limits with flexible roster caps, fundamentally altering the recruitment and team composition strategies of collegiate programs.With this reform, the NCAA wants to ensure a deeper pool of talent across various sports, offering varying levels of scholarship support based on the program's specific needs and financial capabilities, potentially allowing more athletes to receive financial aid and participate in collegiate sports.Which Sports Are Affected?While the spotlight often shines brightest on major sports such as football, basketball, and baseball, the NCAA\u2019s reform will touch on a broad spectrum of athletic programs. For instance, fencing, rowing, and equestrian sports are also set to benefit from the increased support, which could spark a renaissance in these less prominent areas.

Many expect the proposed settlement to become fully approved this Spring. Still, there has undoubtedly been pushback on specific parameters provided, specifically the new roster limit structure, which may put many student-athletes\u2019 dreams of Division I athletics at risk.\u00a0 Initial Revenue Share Cap Has Been Determined\u00a0 One component of this settlement is that student-athletes will receive up to 22% of the average revenue that Power Conference schools generate annually. Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes. Schools are expected to have total control over how they disperse these funds to their athletes next season. The expectation is that many athletic departments will use approximately 90% of the funds for their football and men",

NCAA Settlement: The State of Play in Paying College Athletes By: Jonathan Bloom, Randy Friedberg and Avery Marz A federal judge recently granted preliminary approval to a multibillion-dollar settlement of three athlete-compensation antitrust cases against the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten Conference, Big 12 Conference, Pac-12 Conference and Southeastern Conference. The proposed settlement, filed with the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, brings a closer resolution to the three class-action lawsuits. If finalized, student-athletes would be prohibited from bringing legal action against the NCAA for potential antitrust violations, and they must abandon their pending lawsuits in the following cases: House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA. A New Financial Model The decision moves the NCAA and the conferences closer to funding a nearly $2.8 billion damages pool (over a span of 10 years) to compensate current and former student-athletes. This would set the stage for a fundamental change in college sports. Division I schools would be allowed to start paying athletes directly for use of their name, image and likeness (NIL), subject to a per-school cap that would increase over time. If eligible, current and former student-athletes received notification starting on October 18, and those covered under the settlement agreement can opt out or reject by January 31, 2025. Certain athletes have already objected to the proposed settlement and filed an opposition to the preliminary approval. In addition, the proposed settlement would clear the way for schools to inaugurate a new financial model in which revenue is shared between schools and athletes. Future benefits include athletic compensation through revenue-sharing, which would permit colleges to spend about $22 million annually on paying athletes with no guidelines for how the money can or cannot be spent.

Key court rulings, including the landmark House v. NCAA settlement, have mandated a $2.8 billion payment to former Division I athletes and established a future revenue-sharing model. Additionally, the Third Circuit Court's ruling in Johnson v. NCAA has opened the door for athletes to be considered employees, potentially entitling them to minimum wage and overtime pay. These developments, along with new NCAA regulations and policies, are set to have profound financial and operational implications for institutions across the nation.\u00a0 For more information, join us for our upcoming webinar as a part of our 2nd Annual Athletic Department Toolkit Series: Session 2: The Current Landscape of Student-Athlete Compensation. \u00a0 In May 2024, before summer officially kicked off, the NCAA and its Power Five conferences (SEC, ACC, Big Ten, Pac-12, Big 12) agreed to settle a veritable trilogy of cases: House v. NCAA, Hubbard v. NCAA and Carter v. NCAA.\u00a0 The settlement would resolve a host of antitrust claims by requiring the NCAA to pay around $2.8 billion over ten years to former Division I athletes and establishing a revenue-sharing model for athletes beginning with the 2025-2026 academic year.[1] The agreement still requires approval from the federal judge overseeing the case, and plaintiffs will have the opportunity to opt out of or challenge the settlement terms. However, if it is approved, it would not be an understatement to suggest that the era of amateurism in intercollegiate sports is over.\u00a0 The Trio of Cases\u00a0 While the three cases are close to concluding, it\u2019s worth briefly restating their respective backgrounds:\u00a0 The Objections Era\u00a0 While the settlement officially terminates only the above three cases, it would effectively end other ongoing cases because the athletes would be covered u",

Schools at these NCAA DI conferences were informed that the projected \u201ccap\u201d that schools will work under for the 2025-2026 season would be $20.5 million, as Ross Dellenger of Yahoo Sports reported. This revenue share structure of college athletics is expected to start on July 1st, 2025.\u00a0 Some projections of this figure were as high as $23 million, so the $20.5 Million is slightly lower than expected by some who have followed this settlement closely. The settlement also notes that this cap would receive a 4% increase for the following two seasons.\u00a0 It is important to note that there will be no floor for how much revenue a college program that opts into the settlement parameters needs to share with its student-athletes.

Everyone wants to get paid, and college students are no exception. The lives of student athletes are filled with hard work, but their compensation is often underwhelming in comparison to the high expectations that are placed upon them to perform. Professional and college athletics have a lot in common, but they have one big difference\u2014athlete pay. A scholarship is the highest s",

The NCAA offers a unique platform that combines high-level athletics with quality academics, providing student-athletes with unparalleled opportunities. In this blog post, we will explore the five key benefits of being a student-athlete at an NCAA school, highlighting the advantages that come with this prestigious collegiate experience. The NCAA regulates athletes of 1,281 North American institutions and conferences. It also organises the athletic programs of many colleges and universities in the United States and helps more than 480,000 college student-athletes who compete annually in college sports. The organisation is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. The NCAA has a three-division system of Division I, Division II, and Division III. Under NCAA rules, Division I and Division II schools can offer scholarships to athletes for playing a sport. Division III schools may not offer any athletic scholarships. Generally, larger schools compete in Division I and smaller schools in II and III. In this blog post, we will explore five key benefits of playing and studying at an NCAA university as a student-athlete like our Head of Men\u2019s Soccer James Ward did \u2013 Carson Newman in Tennessee and Ellie Rossiter from our Women\u2019s Soccer team did at Davis & Elkins in West Virginia. Many NCAA alumni having gone on to professional careers \u2013 examples being Michael Jordan (North Carolina) and Tiger Wood (Stanford). You can see some of our NCAA clients here. For our signed athletes they are given all the support and guidance needed to ensure they are at a school and team that is the best fit for them academically, athletically, location-wise and financially. 1.

The changes, set to take effect in August 2024, are among those recommended in January by a Transformation Committee that had been charged with a wide-ranging examination of the future of major-college sports.

The association\u2019s progress toward the new benefits have been touted by NCAA executives, including new president Charlie Baker, and top school and conference administrators as evidence of the association\u2019s willingness to continue making enhancements for athletes that have been demanded by some members of Congress.

Hey! Curious to hear some thoughts on why college athletes shouldn't be paid. I'd like to consider different perspectives to form my own opinion. Thanks! 11 months ago Hello! It's important to consider various perspectives when thinking about whether college athletes should be paid or not. Here are a few common arguments against paying college athletes: 1. Amateurism: One of the main arguments against paying college athletes is preserving the spirit of amateurism in college sports. This means that student-athletes participate in sports for the love and passion they have for the game, not for financial gain. Paying athletes might blur the line between college and professional sports, diminishing the uniqueness and appeal of college athletics. 2. Education and Scholarships: Many college athletes receive scholarships that cover their tuition, room and board, and other expenses. These scholarships can be quite valuable, with some athletes receiving a quality education that may otherwise be unattainable. Opponents of paying college athletes argue that this compensation, in the form of education and scholarships, is already a significant benefit and additional monetary payments are not necessary. 3. Financial Challenges: Paying college athletes could introduce significant financial challenges for colleges and universities, especially for smaller institutions or those with less prominent athletic programs.

By CLRN team / December 25, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not be Paid: A Case for a Fair and Ethical System The debate surrounding the issue of paying college athletes has been ongoing for years, with many arguing that these athletes deserve to be compensated for their talents and hard work. However, there are several reasons why college athletes should not be paid, and in this article, we will explore these arguments in depth. The Main Argument: Balance and Fairness The main argument against paying college athletes is that it would create an unfair and unbalanced system. Athletes who play for top-tier colleges and universities already receive a top-notch education, access to top-notch facilities, and access to top-notch training and coaching. If they were to receive a salary, it would put those who attend smaller colleges and universities at a significant disadvantage. It would be unfair to expect those institutions to match the salaries of larger schools, and it would ultimately lead to a system where only the wealthiest institutions could attract the best talent. The Problem of Professionalization Paying college athletes would also professionalize the sport, which would have far-reaching consequences. College sports are meant to be a part of the educational experience, a way for students to develop important skills such as teamwork, discipline, and time management. If athletes are paid, it would create a situation where the primary focus is on the game, rather than on the education. This would be a disservice to the athletes, who would be going to college to learn and develop as individuals, rather than as professionals.

[Image Descriptor: Photo of Chris] Learn about our Editorial Process College athletes should be paid because they bring a substantial amount of money into their colleges, boost admission rates, put in full-time hours, and do not have the time to get a full-time job on top of their sport. And yet, ridiculously, in many sports, it\u2019s illegal to pay college athletes because it\u2019s considered amateur sports. These are the overarching reasons for which student athletes should be paid. However, there are several more that are justified below.\u00a0 Reasons Why\u00a0College Athletes Should be Paid 1. Student athletes bring in money College sports bring in tremendous amounts of money. Football, basketball, and baseball, in particular, generate billions of dollars a year for colleges in ticket sales, merchandise sales, and advertisements.\u00a0 Considering the massive revenue generated for colleges because of the student athletes, it only makes sense to pay them for their time, commitment, and energy. As the system currently operates, it may be argued that college athletes are being exploited. college athletics is the main avenue into professional sports. Thus, the athletes need to go through college athletics even if the pay is low or non-existent. As a result, they feel they have little choice but to put in free labor for the colleges.

By CLRN team / November 29, 2024 Why College Athletes Should Not Get Paid: The debate about whether college athletes should be paid for their participation in sports has been ongoing for years. While some argue that athletes should be compensated for their talents, others believe that paying them would be unfair and potentially disrupt the delicate balance of college sports. In this article, we\u2019ll explore the reasons why college athletes should not be paid. The NCAA\u2019s Mission: To Provide Education, Not to Make a Profit The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is a non-profit organization that governs collegiate athletics in the United States. The primary goal of the NCAA is to provide opportunities for student-athletes to balance their academic and athletic pursuits. The NCAA\u2019s mission is to \"improve the collegiate athletic experience\" by providing a framework for competition, promoting fair play, and ensuring safe environments for athletes. Not All Sports Are Created Equal: Emphasis on Scholarship Opportunities One of the primary arguments against paying college athletes is that scholarships provide a significant amount of compensation for many student-athletes. In fact, over 90% of all NCAA athletic scholarships are awarded to Division I football and men\u2019s basketball players. These scholarships cover tuition, room, and board, as well as other educational expenses, providing significantly more value to athletes in these sports. The Rise of Athletic Conference Schedules and Strength of Schedule The increasing number of athletic conference games and strength of schedule have also raised concerns about the potential for exploitation.

With increased knowledge of the need for student-athlete mental health support programs, some athletics departments across all NCAA divisions have begun to successfully expand the support they offer to student-athletes. Student-Athlete Mental Health Concerns Student-athletes are about as likely to experience symptoms of depression and other mental health conditions as their non-athlete peers. However, student-athletes experiencing negative mental health symptoms are less likely to seek help from mental health professionals; this can be attributed to a variety of factors, including fear of retribution from coaches or teammates and/or mistrust and discomfort with non-athletics personnel (such as counselors and therapists). Additionally, the culture of toughness expected in many athletics programs can create a resistance to help-seeking among athletes who don't want to be perceived as weak by coaches, peers, and the general public. This decreased likelihood of seeking help puts student-athletes at a higher risk ",

Bill Carter Aug 25, 2024 \u2219 Paid 1 Share this post NIL/edu New Data Indicates the Impact of NIL on Student-Athletes Isn't What You Think Copy link Facebook Email Notes More Share Using my NIL Research Poll, I recently surveyed over 1,100 college student-athletes and high school prospects to get a pulse on how NIL has and has not influenced their daily lives. Time Management: A Delicate Balancing Act The survey results paint a picture of student-athletes grappling with time management in the NIL era. Over half (54%) acknowledged that NIL has impacted the time they dedicate to athletics, academics, and personal pursuits. 18% strongly agree that they've had to make substantial sacrifices and adjustments to their schedules to accommodate NIL activities. This highlights a need for universities and high schools to equip student-athletes with the tools and NIL education necessary to effectively navigate the demands of NIL while upholding their academic and athletic commitments. Financial Well-being: A Double-Edged Sword The financial benefits of NIL are undeniable, with 60% of respondents affirming that it has improved their financial situation - to some degree. However, a closer look reveals a more nuanced picture. Only 24% feel a true sense of greater financial independence or security. This underscores the importance of financial literacy programs tailored to student-athletes. By educating student-athletes about budgeting, investing, and long-term financial planning, schools can empower student-athletes to maximize the benefits of NIL while mitigating potential financial pitfalls.

But it begins with how or if Coaches and Administrators prioritize grit. What if Coaches built rosters based on student-athletes with passion, perseverance, and a commitment to improve? What if they put those qualities on equal footing with physical skills and academic ability? What if Coaches intentionally recruited for this kind of grit and deliberately coached to improve grit once those student-athletes were in their programs?\u00a0 My obsession with grit is founded on a simple belief: grit is a predictor of success across many walks of life from elementary education to employment. And I bet it\u2019s a predictor of the success student-athletes will have in your program and for a lifetime after. A Truth About Grit that Coaches Know In collegiate athletics, where both physical traits and academic capacity are critical, grit alone won\u2019t propel a student-athlete to success. That said, when I ask Coaches to tell me about the most successful student-athletes in their program\u2019s history, they almost never begin by talking about their most physically gifted alumni.\u00a0 The words and phrases I hear most frequently by Coaches in describing their most successful student-athletes are: \u201cloved the game, always had a [ball/stick/other] in her hand, focused, coachable, hard-working, a great practice player.\u201d\u00a0 And often, those descriptors - all of which tie to grit - are followed by details about their athletic ability or \u201chigh [sport] IQ.\u201d In other words, natural talent alone didn\u2019t make them great - grit did.\u00a0 Coaches Should Try the \u201cGrit Scale\u201d The formal, defined concept of \u201cgrit\u201d rose in interest starting with University of Pennsylvania psychologist Angela Duckworth\u2019s 2013 TED talk and her 2016 book Grit: The Power of Passion and Perseverance.

Introduction Everyone is clear on what an athlete does: they train hard, compete, and build successful careers in sports. But what about someone who is still in school? The exact road from being a college student to becoming a full-time athlete is still unclear to some people. Perhaps you\u2019re a prospective student-athlete who wants to know what to expect further down the road. Perhaps you want to know the nitty-gritty details that few people talk about, such as pay, compensation, student-athlete training, recruitment, and managing your time between sports and academics. Or you want to find out more information about student-athlete well-being, now that mental health is such a common topic. If this is the case, this article is for you. In the following paragraphs, you will read important information on many aspects of the life of a student-athlete, which will hopefully make you feel more prepared for the journey ahead. Student-athlete definition Athletics is a popular hobby among college students. Perhaps you already know some students who are crushing it in a sport. or perhaps you are one yourself. But what does it mean to be a student-athlete? How would we define one? Essentially, a student-athlete is someone who takes part in competitive sports alongside their college education. They can do that as part of an intercollegiate athletic program offered by the school, and they devote their time both to their degree and athletic goals. But are there any student athlete benefits, one might ask? Are the stress, tiredness, and business really worth the journey of being an athlete?

Setting and achieving goals is the compass that guides this journey, transforming aspirations into tangible accomplishments. In this comprehensive blog post, we'll provide student-athletes with a blueprint for success, offering practical steps to set realistic and achievable short-term and long-term goals. Whether it's excelling in academics, mastering a skill, or reaching new athletic heights, this guide aims to empower student-athletes on their path to success. Understanding the Power of Goal Setting Clarity of Purpose: Goals provide a clear sense of purpose and direction, guiding student-athletes in their pursuit of excellence. Defining goals helps create a roadmap, breaking down larger aspirations into actionable steps. Motivation and Commitment: Goals serve as powerful motivators, instilling a sense of purpose and commitment. Clearly defined goals create a compelling vision that propels student-athletes through challenges and setbacks. Measurable Progress: Goals provide a framework for measuring progress, enabling student-athletes to track their development. Celebrating small victories along the way builds confidence and reinforces the commitment to the larger vision. Step-by-Step Plan for Setting and Achieving Goals 1. Reflect and Define: Begin by reflecting on personal values, passions, and long-term aspirations. Clearly define short-term (within a year) and long-term (3-5 years) goals for both academics and athletics. 2. Specificity and Clarity: Make goals specific and clear. Instead of vague objectives like \"improve performance,\" specify measurable outcomes such as \"increase free throw accuracy by 10%\" or \"maintain a GPA of 3.5 or above.\" 3. Break Down Goals: Divide long-term goals into smaller, manageable short-term objectives. Create a step",

Claim Your Share Share with fellow athletes Understanding the Settlements The House v. NCAA, Carter v. NCAA, and Hubbard v. NCAA cases resulted in landmark settlements totaling $2.8 billion. In the lawsuits, college athletes argued they were denied the chance to earn money from endorsements and media appearances, which they alleged was in violation of antitrust laws.\u00a0These settlements compensate athletes for lost opportunities, recognizing their contributions and ensuring fair treatment moving forward. Case Background Why is this case necessary? The case arose from the NCAA\u2019s policies that prevented college athletes from monetizing their name, image, and likeness (NIL) and earning other compensation beyond scholarships. \u00a0The settlements address these issues and aim to reshape the landscape of college athletics. Settlement Details How does the $2.8 billion get distributed? For the House Settlement, the Defendants (NCAA and Power Five Conferences) have agreed to pay $2,576,000,000 into a settlement fund (\"damages settlement\"). This money will be divided among class members (according to a Distribution Plan) and will also be used to pay for attorneys' costs and fees approved by the Court, including the cost of administering this settlement and awards to the class representatives for their help in the lawsuit. For the Hubbard Settlement, the Defendants (NCAA and Power Five Conferences) have agreed to pay $200,000,000 into a settlement fund.

Resources People Services Industries Supreme Court Rules Against NCAA Regarding Student-Athlete Education Benefits On June 21, 2021, the Supreme Court issued a unanimous decision that ends the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) nationwide limits on education-related benefits athletes can receive for playing collegiate sports. In\u00a0NCAA v. Alston, current and former student-athletes brought an antitrust lawsuit challenging the NCAA's restrictions and limits on compensation provided to athletes. Specifically, they alleged that the NCAA's rules violated the Sherman Act, which is the federal statute that prohibits \"contract[s], combination[s], or conspirac[ies] in restraint of trade or commerce.\"\u00a0 A federal district court in California declined to disturb the NCAA's rules limiting undergraduate athletic scholarships and other compensation related to\u00a0athletic\u00a0performance, but struck down the NCAA rules limiting the\u00a0education-related\u00a0benefits schools may offer student-athletes\u2014such as those limiting tutoring, graduate school tuition, vocational school tuition, and paid internships. According to the district court, \"the NCAA offered no cogent explanation for why limits or prohibitions on these education-related benefits are necessary to preserve consumer demand [for collegiate athletics],\" and further held that certain limits on education-related compensation were arbitrary. The district court, therefore, enjoined the NCAA from continuing to enforce limitations on education-related benefits to student athletes.\u00a0 Both parties appealed the decision and the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the district co",

Key Changes and Impacts Explained Analysis / By CollegeNetWorth / December 19, 2024 College Football The landscape of college athletics is undergoing a significant change. The new NCAA rule allows for direct payment to student-athletes, marking a shift from traditional amateurism. This introduces a new era where athletes can be compensated for their contributions, addressing ongoing debates about fairness and equity in sports. With the NCAA\u2019s push to amend its rules, student-athletes can now benefit from their names, images, and likenesses (NIL) in ways previously prohibited. This is a crucial development for those who compete in high-revenue sports like college football and men\u2019s college basketball. The decision directly affects how universities approach recruitment and athlete support, paving the way for a more equitable system.

What Board Members Need to Know Regarding the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling The Supreme Court, with Justice Neil Gorsuch writing the majority opinion, unanimously reaffirmed a federal district court\u2019s ruling that in addition to other already permissible benefits (e.g., tuition, room and board, and books), the NCAA cannot prohibit institutions from providing additional education-related benefits such as: For now, the NCAA may still enforce a ban on paying direct salaries to players and providing other non-education-related benefits.

Data from the NCAA Graduation Rates Database reveals that athletes not only excel academically but often outperform their non-athlete peers in several key areas. With a Graduation Success Rate (GSR) of 91%, student-athletes benefit from structured support systems, accountability, and a sense of purpose that extends beyond the playing field. This success is particularly significant for underrepresented demographics, where athletes consistently achieve higher outcomes. For students uncertain about playing sports in college, these findings highlight how athletics can provide a pathway to academic achievement and a valuable edge in their educational journey. Moreover, the strong academic performance of student-athletes explains why colleges value their contributions, both on the field and in the classroom, making them integral to campus life.

This study creates a model of the athlete compensation incentive effect from single and multinomial grouping perspectives, combining empirical research (SEM) with fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) based on a sample of 352 validated data. The results lead to two findings. First, athletes\u2019 direct economic compensation, direct non-economic compensation, and indirect non-economic compensation have a significant positive effect on the incentive effect of compensation. Second, that the incentive effect of high compensation has two configurations, namely \u201ceconomic value\u201d and \u201ceconomic environmental value.\u201d It seems that the effective combination of compensation factors can enhance the motivation effect in a \u201cdifferent way.\u201d 1 Introduction Athlete motivation is one of the most important factors influencing the quality development of competitive sports. Motivation is dependent upon an individual\u2019s expectations about their ability to perform tasks and obtain the desired rewards (Yavuz, 2004). To motivate athletes into training, the state has adopted a series of measures, such as the formation of a remuneration structure of \u201cbasic salary & training allowance & bonus and subsidy\u201d in terms of financial compensation. This can be a fair reward for athletes\u2019 hard work and good performance, but also an important way of motivating more people to actively participate in sports. In addition to financial compensation, the government also provides career development opportunities and educational support for outstanding athletes who can participate in high-level training and have access to higher education. Economic and non-economic compensation together constitute a perfect system of compensation system for athletes. Through this approach",

Therefore, we investigate the relationship among monetary incentives, organizational support, and athletic performance in elite team sports. Research methods: This study is the first in sports management to calculate the relative effects of non-monetary incentives of organizational support and monetary incentives on individual performance through job satisfaction. Furthermore, we apply an innovative measurement approach of player performance by using individual performance ratings of coaches. We collect questionnaires from 315 athletes and 34 coaches of 19 professional football, ice hockey, and handball clubs in Germany. Results and findings: Two variables of organizational support \u2013 namely, integration of family and private problem support \u2013 show strong positive effects on athletes\u2019 job satisfaction.

A labor market occurs when sellers of labor interact with buyers of labor. People in the workforce sell labor services to prospective employers in return for a payment. In a competitive labor market, buyers and sellers are numerous. Consider the labor market for accountants. In most cities, many firms employ accountants and many people are trained to work as accountants. A firm will hire an accountant only if the wage that it has to pay the accountant is exceeded by the value generated by the accountant. That value is known as the marginal revenue product (MRP), the value that an employee produces after all other input costs are taken into consideration. For example, suppose Andrea produces $1,500 in accounting services each week for her employer, firm A, and the cost of the inputs that she needs to do her job (e.g., a computer and an office) is $300 per week. Under these circumstances, firm A should be willing to pay her up to $1,200 every week. It would prefer to pay her less, of course, but it must take into consideration the other accounting firms that are competing for Andrea's services. If firm B offers Andrea a higher wage than she currently receives, she may s",

But behind the scenes, there is another aspect of the sports industry that often remains hidden from the public eye \u2013 athlete salaries. The world of professional sports is not only about the game itself but also about the lucrative contracts that athletes sign. In this article, we will delve into the realm of athlete salaries in professional sports, exploring the factors that influence these salaries and shedding light on some of the highest-paid athletes in the world. The Economics of Athlete Salaries At the heart of athlete salaries lies the complex world of sports economics. Supply and demand play a crucial role in determining how much athletes are paid. The scarcity of exceptional talent and the immense demand for top-tier athletes contribute to the staggering figures we often hear about. Professional sports leagues generate billions of dollars in revenue through ticket sales, broadcasting rights, merchandise, and sponsorships. A significant portion of this revenue is allocated to athlete salaries, reflecting the value that these athletes bring to their respective sports. Factors Influencing Athlete Salaries Numerous factors come into play when determining athlete salaries in professional sports. Performance on the field, championships won, endorsements, marketability, and even the sport itself all contribute to the final figure. Athletes who consistently perform at an elite level and bring success to their teams often command higher salaries. Endorsements and sponsorships can also significantly boost an athlete\u2019s earnings, especially if they have a strong personal brand and a large following.

You\u2019re not alone. It\u2019s a hot debate whether sports stars truly deserve their hefty paychecks. From multi-million dollar contracts to lucrative endorsements, these players seem to have hit the jackpot just for playing a game they love. But is it all fair play or is there a mismatch in the value they provide versus the money they make? Let\u2019s dive into the world of sports economics and see if these astronomical sums really make sense or if we\u2019re witnessing an overinflated sports bubble about to burst. Economic Value of Sports Players Imagine stepping into a stadium teeming with excitement, where every cheer and chant is a testament to the allure of sports. As a sports enthusiast who\u2019s been on both ends of the playing field, you know the magnetic pull athletes have on fans. It\u2019s not just about the game; it\u2019s about the heroes that make every match unforgettable. Athletes are pivotal to the sports industry, becoming the face of teams, brands, and sometimes even cities. Their ability to draw crowds is undeniable, with attendance figures often hinging on the presence of star players. Yet, when evaluating an athlete\u2019s economic value, one must consider the entire ecosystem of sports economics. Broadcast rights, for example, are sold at premium prices with networks vying to showcase games featuring elite talent. This in turn feeds into the large contracts that athletes sign. In your experience, you\u2019ve seen how youth sports can drive local economies, with tournaments bringing in tourism and supporting businesses. Imagine that impact amplified on a professional scale. The presence of a top athlete can lead to increased economic activity in an area, often dubbed the \u201cMultiplying Effect.\u201d It\u2019s essential, however, to peek behind the curtain of these economic advantages.

Sign In Lucrative Pro Sport Contracts, Motivation Issues, and Failed Return on Investment No Comments Albert Pujols and Josh Hamilton are two of the wealthiest players in Major League Baseball today, but their current statistics hardly back up their monster contracts.\u00a0 In each case massive, long-term contracts were offered based on previous All-Star level performances, yet both Pujols and Hamilton have put up rather pedestrian numbers since receiving their pay.\u00a0 Alex Rodriguez had earned the most lucrative contract in baseball (twice actually), yet few people today see him earning his keep with the years remaining on his current deal.\u00a0 Sport psychologists want to know where\u2019s the mental toughness after cashing in on big paydays? Pay, motivation, & performance examined The issue of pay, motivation, and performance is, of course, much bigger than Pujols, Hamilton, and ARod, as we see professional sport GM\u2019s regularly offer outlandish contracts to players who sometimes fail to live up to anything close to what was expected.\u00a0 Outside of the NFL, professional contracts are guaranteed, meaning once a player signs his deal he is assured of getting his money \u2014 even if his numbers stink.\u00a0 This issue of pay and performance might not seem like a big deal to you, but when teams invest upwards of $200 million in a player only to see him put up average numbers afterward (i.e. Josh Hamilton this year), it becomes a very big deal to the GM\u2019s left looking foolish for spending such huge amounts of money yet receiving little in return for the investment. When GM\u2019s invest in a player there are many variables impacting the decision, including the current market, the team\u2019s needs, the other players available at the time, and the \u201chype\u201d of emotion related to \u201cwhat if he has 10 more years in him\u201d when thinking about the player\u2019s monster stats to date (as was the case with Albert Pujols and Alex Rodriguez).\u00a0 The probl",

Unai P\u00e9rez de Arrilucea Le Floc'h, Writer Motivation is something very important to know how to manage any high-performance athlete and \u201camateur\u201d sport. Many times, we coaches think that athletes become machines because they reproduce and reproduce workouts practically every day of their sporting life. However, it is very important that athletes do not stagnate and that they have clear goals and objectives. Motivation is difficult to maintain, all athletes usually start their training sessions or seasons very motivated, but as the year goes by, motivation drops and our athletes may stagnate and their performance maybe stuck as well. Motivating athletes is something that goes hand in hand with the coach or physical trainer. But, as coaches, we must keep in mind that the athlete\u2019s motivation depends on many factors and that there are some in which we can intercede and others we cannot. \u00a0 What motivates the athlete? As we have said, the athlete\u2019s motivation depends on many factors. And, each athlete feels motivated by one thing and it does not have to coincide. In fact, athletes do not usually have the same motivations, and, moreover, motivations change over time. Let\u2019s take a very simple example; Conor McGregor can be considered one of the best martial arts fighters of the 21st century. But the motivation with which he started in the world of martial arts is different from the motivation he possesses today. Conor McGregor reportedly started out playing football and it was at the age of 18 after meeting UFC fighter Tom Egan that he began training martial arts. The motivation back then came from Tom Egan planting that seed in Conor. After winning his first fight by \u201cKnock-out\u201d his motivation changed, and hours later he had already signed his first contract to dedicate himself professionally to martial arts and that was his greatest motivation. Little by little he was winning fights until his motivation was to become the number one in each of the weights ",

By Assistant Campus EditorMay 5, 2014 A recent study analyzing athletes\u2019 motivation may change the way major league sports organizations negotiate player contracts. The study, published Jan. 22 in Springer Science+Business Media, found that an athlete\u2019s performance reaches its peak during his or her contract year\u2014the year before a players\u2019s contract is up. For the study, Mark White, a senior psychological science major at the University of Missouri-Columbia, compiled and analyzed more than 230 NBA and Major League Baseball players\u2019 sports statistics during their pre-contract year, the contract year and the post-contract year. \u201cExtrinsic motivators like money or an athletic contract can threaten physiological needs such as feeling [in control] or [being] confident,\u201d White said. \u201cIt decreases our extrinsic motivators and decreases how much we enjoy [sports and] we\u00a0perform worse.\u201d White said motivators like pay could inspire players during their contract year, which can lead to big bonuses. The problem, though, is that playing for money undermines how much an athlete will enjoy performing the following year because of the loss of these motivators. White said the study suggests that instead of giving athletes intrinsic motivators, sports team managers should make players feel comfortable with the teams, and also feel as if they are making their own decisions so that they are more confident in their choices. How well athletes perform depends on their contracts. If athletes are motivated, they will perform better. White said economists tend to focus on how much money athletes should make during their contract year but neglect the psychological impacts a contract year can haveon players.

Athlete endorsements not only provide a lucrative income stream but also boost an athlete\u2019s brand and public image. From lucrative sponsorship deals to brand collaborations, endorsements offer countless opportunities for athletes to expand their reach and capitalize on their fame. In this article, we will explore the ins and outs of athlete endorsements, including the benefits, strategies for success, and the future of this ever-evolving industry. Types of Athlete Endorsements Athlete endorsements come in various forms, ranging from traditional sponsorships to social media collaborations. Traditional sponsorships involve athletes becoming the face of a brand, appearing in advertisements, and endorsing products or services. Social media collaborations, on the other hand, leverage the athlete\u2019s online presence to promote brands and products to their followers. These collaborations often involve sponsored posts, product reviews, and exclusive discount codes. Factors Influencing Endorsement Deals Several factors come into play when it comes to securing lucrative endorsement deals. One of the most crucial factors is an athlete\u2019s performance and achievements in their respective sport. High-profile athletes who consistently perform well and have a strong presence in the media are more likely to attract endorsement opportunities. Additionally, an athlete\u2019s marketability, personal brand, and overall image play a significant role in attracting potential sponsors. Building a Personal Brand To maximize endorsement opportunities, athletes must invest in building a strong personal brand. This involves cultivating a unique identity and narrative that resonates with fans and potential sponsors. At",

One of the most effective strategies for achieving these goals is athlete endorsements. Whether it\u2019s a professional football player, a tennis champion, or a soccer star, athletes have a unique ability to influence public perception, drive consumer behavior, and enhance brand credibility. Athlete endorsements aren\u2019t just for large corporations with massive marketing budgets\u2014small and medium-sized businesses can also leverage the power of these partnerships. This article explores the many benefits of athlete endorsements and how they can significantly boost brand credibility and consumer trust. 1. Instant Credibility and Trustworthiness One of the most significant benefits of athlete endorsements is their immediate boost in credibility. Athletes, especially those with successful careers and positive public personas, are considered trustworthy, disciplined, and hardworking. When a brand is associated with an athlete, it automatically gains some of that athlete\u2019s credibility and positive attributes. Consumers are more likely to trust a product or service if they see it endorsed by someone they admire and respect. An athlete\u2019s endorsement signals that the product is reliable, high-quality, and worth considering. For example, when an athlete promotes a specific type of sports gear, supplements, or health products, consumers assume that they have been thoroughly tested and approved by someone who knows what they\u2019re discussing. This credibility transfer can help a brand establish itself as trustworthy in the eyes of consumers. 2. Increased Brand Awareness and Exposure Athlete endor",

Amateurism, Professionalism and the Value of College Sports Heather L. Reid Morningside University Exedra Mediterranean Center Introduction The summer of 2021 seemed revolutionary for college sports. In NCAA v. Alston et al., the Supreme Court struck down limits on education-related benefits for college athletes, state laws went into effect permitting them to profit from their fame, and pay-for-play with standard employment benefits seemed just around the corner. All forms of media were abuzz with debate about the value of college sports. Behind today\u2019s legal, financial, and institutional questions, however, there are philosophical issues with roots running back to 535 BCE. That was the summer when the philoso\u00ad pher Pythagoras (known today for his theorem) walked into a gymnasium and mar\u00ad veled at the masterful ball-playing skills of a certain young athlete. Reasoning that such a performance demanded extraordinary virtues such as patience, persistence, courage, and self-control, the philosopher devised a scheme to educate him. Py\u00ad thagoras offered to financially support the youth\u2019s athletic training in exchange for following the philosopher\u2019s lessons. The athlete agreed, and after some time, Py\u00ad thagoras noticed that the athlete\u2019s motivation to study had shifted from the money to intellectual honor, so he cleverly announced that he would no longer be able to pay. The athlete offered to continue studying for free, but Pythagoras pled poverty, so the athlete, having developed a great passion for his studies, turned around and began paying the philosopher for the lessons (Iamblichus 300/1818, 5.21-24). The ancient story has a happy ending, with the athlete Pythagoras recruited eventually writing his own books and travelling with his mentor to combine aca\u00ad demic study with athletic exercise in gymnasi",

However, recent changes in legislation and policy regarding Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) rights signal a paradigm shift in college athletics, where student-athletes are now able to monetize their skills and marketability. This paper examines the transformation of \u201camateurism\u201d in the NCAA, arguing that the term has lost much of its original meaning in a landscape where student-athletes are increasingly recognized as economic contributors rather than purely amateur participants. With the erosion of traditional amateur ideals, the NCAA\u2019s definition of amateurism requires a reevaluation to reflect the evolving realities of college sports. Introduction: The Shifting Foundations of Amateurism The NCAA has historically defended amateurism as a foundational principle that preserves the \u201ceducational character\u201d of college sports, asserting that student-athletes should compete without the economic motives typical of professional sports. This stance has provided a rationale for denying athletes compensation beyond scholarships and basic living stipends, based on the belief that such payments would compromise the integrity of college athletics. However, recent developments, particularly the adoption of NIL policies that allow student-athletes to profit from their personal brand, challenge the validity and necessity of amateurism. Today, student-athletes exist in a hybrid role\u2014students who participate in highly commercialized sports and contributors to a billion-dollar industry, casting doubt on the NCAA\u2019s traditional definition of amateurism. Historical Context: Amateurism as Economic Control The NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules originated in the early 20th century, when college sports were fa",

By CLRN team / December 26, 2024 Should Student Athletes Get Paid? The debate about whether student athletes should be paid has been ongoing for years, with passionate arguments on both sides. In this article, we\u2019ll delve into the pros and cons of paying student athletes and provide a direct answer to the question. The Current Situation Currently, student athletes in the United States are not paid for their athletic performances. According to the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), college athletes are considered amateurs and are not allowed to receive compensation for their athletic services. This means that athletes are not paid a salary, and their expenses, such as tuition, room, and board, are covered by scholarships or financial aid. Arguments For Paying Student Athletes There are several arguments in favor of paying student athletes: Exploitation: Critics argue that colleges and universities are profiting from the talent and hard work of student athletes, while the athletes themselves receive little to no compensation. According to a report by the NCAA, the organization generated over $1 billion in revenue in 2020, with the majority coming from television contracts and sponsorships. Market Value: Student athletes generate significant revenue for their schools and conferences through ticket sales, merchandise, and media rights. According to a study by the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics, Division I schools generated over $2.5 billion in revenue from athletics in 2020. Expenses: Student athletes often incur significant expenses, including travel, equipment, and training, which can be difficult for them to afford. Paying student athletes could help offset these costs. Fairness: Some argue that paying student athletes is a matter of fa",

There are several reasons given in support for both sides. Some rationales supporting the payment of student athletes include college athletes expenditure of time towards their sport\u2014an average of 43.3 hours per week, college athletes struggle to make ends meet, paying students would only make the sport more competitive, the money earned from athletics is not automatically reinvested in education and research, the college sports apparel market capitalizes specifically on these players, payment would help athletes leave school with a degree and little debt, and the NCAA is an $11 billion industry which should be able to afford paying people on all levels, including the players.. \u00a0 Common arguments against the payment of student athletes encompass a lack of college athletic programs to \u00a0afford to pay athletes, elite college athletes receive athletic scholarships which serves as a form of compensation, there is no fair way to pay college athletes, students are not professionals, paying student athletes will cause cuts elsewhere, and paying college athletes will ruin college sports. \u00a0 One of the major arguments used by the NCAA is the preservation of its amateurism model and the fact that the players are student-athletes. According to the NCAA, an amateur is a person that \u201cdoes not have a written or verbal agreement with an agent, has not profited above his/her actual and necessary expenses or gained a competitive advantage in his/her sport.\u201d There has been pushback and litigation against the NCAA and its resistance to pay student athletes.

Each Saturday in the fall, we huddle around in our school colors waiting with baited breath to watch college football teams take the field. College athletics is a part of daily life for people, similar to that of professional sports. However, there is one glaring difference for the athletes themselves \u2013 the paychecks being deposited in the bank. The compensation of college athletes is a hotly debated topic from college campuses to Capital Hill. But what exactly is everyone arguing about and where does this debate stand? Let\u2019s break it down play by play. Arguments for Paying College Athletes Why do people think that college athletes should be getting paid? Is their academic compensation through scholarships not enough? The main argument is that the NCAA profits from the talent of athletes that work under its jurisdiction without paying them \u2013 just as an employer profits from the work of its employees. Defenders of compensating athletes argue that this is just an illustration of labor exploitation, making money off the name, image, and likeness of a person without paying them accordingly. According to NCAA financial statements, the nonprofit organization brought in over $1 billion in 2018 from college athletics, with athletes seeing little of that money.\u00a0The Economist\u00a0found that if college athletes were compensated for the NCAA using their image, name, and likeness in advertising, promotions, sales, etc., \u201cthe top 10 percent of football and 16 percent of basketball players would be paid around $400,000 and $250,000 a year respectively.\u201d College athletes are providing value and talent for the NCAA, just as professional athletes are to their respective organizations; however, they aren\u2019t seeing a dime.

By CLRN team / December 17, 2024 How Much Do College Athletes Get Paid? The question of whether college athletes should be paid has been a contentious issue in the world of higher education for years. While some argue that student-athletes are already compensated through scholarships and other forms of support, others believe that the millions of dollars generated by college athletics could be shared with the athletes themselves. In this article, we\u2019ll dive into the issue of how much college athletes get paid and whether it\u2019s a fair system. The Current System: Amateur Status Under the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) rules, college athletes are considered \"amateurs,\" meaning they do not receive direct compensation for their athletic abilities. The NCAA argues that this is necessary to maintain the integrity of college sports and to ensure that athletes are in college for an education, not just to get paid. Scholarships and Financial Aid What Do Scholarships Cover? While college athletes do not receive direct pay, they do receive scholarships and financial aid to help them fund their education. These scholarships can cover full tuition, room, and board, or a combination of these expenses. The amount of the scholarship varies widely depending on the institution, the sport, and the individual\u2019s academic performance.

This change allows college athletes to profit from their personal brand, a shift long overdue in a system historically built on amateurism. The NCAA now supports athletes making money off endorsements, merchandise sales, and social media, opening new doors for financial opportunities. Many athletes have already begun to see life-changing earnings that reflect their efforts and popularity. Critics argue that these payouts could overshadow the importance of education and teamwork, while supporters believe that athletes deserve to be compensated for their contributions to college sports.

As the NCAA starts allowing college athletes to profit from their name, image, and likeness, questions arise about the impact of these changes. NIL deals can provide significant financial benefits to college athletes, but they also introduce potential challenges that could affect their focus and opportunities in sports. Many believe these deals empower athletes by allowing them to monetize their talents, with reports showing that some athletes earn thousands of dollars through endorsements. However, critics argue that this shift could widen the gap between top-tier and lesser-known programs, distracting athletes from their primary goal of competing in sports.

While my previous discussions focused on the immediate effects of NIL such as player recruitment and team dynamics, this paper will provide an understanding of these effects on a deeper level. Beyond redefining the relationship between athletes and their universities, NIL has created a new era plagued with psychological, performance, and ethical complexities. By examining aspects of NIL\u2019s influence, such as its psychological impact on player performance, the shifting dynamics within teams, and the broader societal perceptions of money in college sports, we will better understand college athletics in the NIL era. We aim to shed light on the effects of NIL and propose recommendations to navigate these complexities. The psychological effects of NIL are something no one talks about but have severe implications. One cannot ignore the major impact that financial incentives may have on the psyche of these young student-athletes. Where once the pursuit of success on the field was fueled by passion, dedication, and the goal of going to the NFL, NIL introduces a new variable which is immediate financial gratification. This raises questions about the motivations that drive athletes now, including the pressures they face, and the potential consequences on their mental health. For many student-athletes, the idea of monetizing their talents not only means financial gains but also may serve as validation of their value as an athlete. However, this may introduce unforeseen pressures and problems. Athletes may have to tackle questions of self-worth, as their value is increasingly measured not only by their athletic performance but also by their",

Through NIL deals with companies, many positives have come out of it. For example, only 2% of college athletes make it into the pros, which leaves 98% of student-athletes having to find a job after college which in most cases pays significantly less than what a pro athlete would make. If you are one of the athletes that are skilled or lucky enough to have the opportunity to play in the pros the average career length is around 4-6 years and that\u2019s if you do not get injured. This means by the time an athlete is around 28-30 years old they are going to have to start looking for a new career path. However, thanks to NIL deals athletes can start making money now while they\u2019re in college so that way even if they do not make the pros they will still be set up for success once they graduate college. NIL deals can vary, the starting quarterback at the University of Alabama Bryce Young took full advantage of his NIL and Young now has a total valuation of $3.2 million. Money that he never would have seen given he was in college 4 years ago. However, there are downsides to NIL deals too.\u00a0 Not every athlete was created equal, so how does this playoff in the locker room when one guy is making millions while another might be getting the bare minimum or nothing at all?

Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a motion.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

This revenue is largely attributable to the athletes' performance and public appeal. Therefore, compensating student-athletes directly recognizes their integral role in this multi-billion dollar industry.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Sharing revenue with student-athletes enhances the image and reputation of college sports.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_17', 'query': 'Public opinion on paying student athletes', 'title': \"More Than Half of Americans Say 'Yes' to Student-Athletes Payments for ...\", 'url': 'https://www.shu.edu/business/news/sports-poll-public-favors-student-athlete-pay.html'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Sharing revenue with student-athletes addresses the growing public support for fair compensation in college sports, as evidenced by the Seton Hall Sports Poll (May 2021) showing over half of Americans favoring payments to athletes in revenue-generating sports.

        "content": "Look, everyone, we're here today to talk about a big change needed in college sports \u2013 making things fairer and giving athletes the recognition they deserve. We firmly support the motion that student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue.\n\nFirst off, let's be clear about what we're talking about here.  We're talking about D1 athletes in sports that bring in money \u2013 mainly football and men's and women's basketball.  These athletes should get a cut of the money their sport makes, paid out through a trust fund that's run by someone else. They'd get the money after they graduate or leave, based on a formula anyone can see that looks at how much money the sport makes, how well the team does, and how much each athlete contributes.  Importantly, this keeps things fair for men and women and keeps college athletes amateur \u2013 no endorsements or talking to pro teams while they're in school.\n\nThe question we're asking is simple but important: Does this make college sports fairer and better for the future? We believe it unequivocally does. Think about this: is it really fair that these young athletes, many from poor backgrounds, aren't paid when they're the ones making the system work?\n\nWe're making three main points here. First, paying athletes recognizes how much they do for this huge, multi-billion dollar industry. Secondly, sharing revenue enhances the image and reputation of college sports. And finally, profit-sharing empowers student-athletes financially, preparing them for life beyond the game.\n\nLet me turn to our first point.  The NCAA generates staggering revenue, primarily from men\u2019s basketball. Studies in ESPN show nearly $1.28 billion was generated in 2022-23 [1]. This huge number shows just how much money college sports makes.  Who makes this happen? The athletes.  Their dedication and talent bring in the fans, sponsors, and TV viewers. Compensating them directly recognizes their integral role in this multi-billion dollar enterprise.\n\nThis brings me to our second point. Sharing the money with athletes is what people want; they want fair pay.  Research in Seton Hall Sports Poll indicates that more than half of Americans now support payments to athletes in revenue-generating sports [2].  This evolving public opinion underscores the need for change. Imagine you're a great athlete, working so hard, making millions for your school, but you can't even pay your bills. How would that feel? This shift in public perception is crucial. It fosters a more positive view of college sports, moving away from the narrative of exploitation toward a model of equity and transparency.  This improved image strengthens the integrity and long-term viability of college athletics.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the financial empowerment of student-athletes, our third point. What's really important is that this money helps athletes, especially those from families who don't have a lot.  As explained in \"Revenue Sharing: What It Means for College Athletes\", this compensation extends beyond scholarships, offering crucial financial stability [3]. Imagine you\u2019re a first-generation college student balancing rigorous academics with the demands of a high-level sport.  The added financial security allows athletes to focus on their studies, internships, and future careers, ensuring a smoother transition to life after college.  It levels the playing field, offering opportunities that extend far beyond the game.\n\nIn conclusion, compensating student-athletes is not merely a matter of fairness; it\u2019s a matter of building a more sustainable and ethical future for college sports.  It recognizes their invaluable contributions, enhances the image of college athletics, and empowers these young individuals for life beyond the court or field.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in championing a more just and equitable future for college sports.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] ESPN. (n.d.).

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nHey everyone, we're here today to argue against paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits. Sure, it sounds nice at first, but looking closer, there are some serious downsides \u2013 it could really hurt athletic departments and universities financially.  The proponents have suggested a complex system of payouts through trust funds, but this does not address the fundamental issues we will raise.\n\nBefore we get started, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. We're on the same page about focusing on Division I athletes in big-money sports like football and basketball. We should be thinking about how this affects everyone on campus \u2013 athletes, students, academics, and the university's bottom line. It's essential to look at the bigger picture so we can make a smart choice here.\n\nHere\u2019s our case in three points: One, paying athletes could destabilize athletic department finances. Two, doing this creates a huge administrative headache. And three, it opens universities up to major legal and financial risks.\n\nOkay, so first up: how paying athletes could create financial instability. The Wall Street Journal found many college athletic departments are already running on thin ice, money-wise [1].  Giving a chunk of that revenue to athletes, as suggested, would just make things worse. Think about it: if they\u2019re already struggling, how can they pay athletes too?  This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports, impacting a wider range of student-athletes. It could also force reductions in coaching staff and support services, ultimately harming the quality of athletic programs.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the nightmare of actually making this work.  Keepr.io shows how complicated it is to track where all the money goes with profit-sharing [2].  Imagine figuring out each athlete's cut based on how well they play, how the team does, and gender equity rules.  This creates mountains of paperwork, eats up money, and could take away resources from teaching and learning.  This means less money for classrooms, libraries, and research \u2013 resources that benefit all students, not just athletes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the legal and financial liability that profit-sharing creates, our third point. The proponents\u2019 argument relies on classifying student-athletes as employees.  However, this classification triggers significant legal ramifications, particularly regarding worker\u2019s compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation [3].  Given the inherent risks in college sports, the frequency of injuries is high.  Universities would face a substantial increase in worker\u2019s compensation claims.  Imagine you're a university administrator.  How do you budget for the unpredictable costs associated with athlete injuries? This financial burden is further explored in articles like \"College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing\" and \"Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox,\" both published on AthleticDirectorU [4, 5].  These articles highlight the already rising expenses in college athletics and the financial pressures faced by non-profit institutions. Adding worker\u2019s compensation claims to this equation could cripple athletic department budgets.  While some might argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, this is a risky gamble. The unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and injury rates makes this an unstable foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of compensating student-athletes may seem appealing, the practical implications of profit-sharing are fraught with financial, operational, and legal challenges. We urge you to consider the broader impact on the university ecosystem and vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huron Consulting Group. (n.d.).

Harvard University's Journal of Sports and Entertainment Law suggests mirroring professional sports' revenue-sharing models, which are well-established and manageable.  These precedents minimize the perceived administrative burden and address gender equity through percentage-based allocation.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"Paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits could hurt athletic departments and universities financially.\", \"argument\": [\"Many college athletic departments are already financially strained (Wall Street Journal).\", \"Sharing revenue would exacerbate existing financial difficulties.\", \"This could lead to cuts in non-revenue sports, coaching staff, and support services, harming the quality of athletic programs.\", \"Employee classification triggers legal obligations like worker\\'s compensation (Workers\\' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers).\", \"High injury rates in college sports would lead to a surge in worker\\'s compensation claims.\", \"The unpredictable costs of athlete injuries would make budgeting difficult.\", \"Articles on AthleticDirectorU highlight rising expenses in college athletics and financial pressures on non-profit institutions, which would be worsened by worker\\'s compensation claims.\", \"While profit-sharing might offset some costs, the unpredictable nature of sports revenue and injury rates makes this a risky approach.\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '6_28', 'query': 'Financial benefits of college sports for universities', 'title': 'The Importance of College Athletic Programs to Universities - Seattle PI', 'url': 'https://education.seattlepi.com/importance-college-athletic-programs-universities-1749.html'}]\n**Short Argument**: Sharing revenue can actually improve university finances by attracting top talent and boosting donations, fostering athletic success and generating more revenue, as highlighted by the Seattle PI. The claim of financial difficulty is too simplistic and ignores the potential for increased earnings.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Compensating student-athletes acknowledges their contributions to the multi-billion dollar college sports industry.\", \"argument\": [\"The NCAA generates substantial revenue, primarily from men\\'s basketball, as evidenced by the $1.28 billion generated in 2022-23 (ESPN).\", \"Student-athletes are the primary drivers of this revenue through their talent and dedication, attracting fans, sponsors, and viewers.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits could hurt athletic departments and universities financially.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Many college athletic departments are already financially strained (Wall Street Journal).\\\\\", \\\\\"Sharing revenue would exacerbate existing financial difficulties.\\\\\", \\\\\"This could lead to cuts in non-revenue sports, coaching staff, and support services, harming the quality of athletic programs.\\\\\", \\\\\"Employee classification triggers legal obligations like worker\\'s compensation (Workers\\' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers).\\\\\", \\\\\"High injury rates in college sports would lead to a surge in worker\\'s compensation claims.\\\\\", \\\\\"The unpredictable costs of athlete injuries would make budgeting difficult.\\\\\", \\\\\"Articles on AthleticDirectorU highlight rising expenses in college athletics and financial pressures on non-profit institutions, which would be worsened by worker\\'s compensation claims.\\\\\", \\\\\"While profit-sharing might offset some costs, the unpredictable nature of sports revenue and injury rates makes this a risky approach.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_12', 'query': 'How much money does the NCAA make from college sports?', 'title': 'NCAA generates nearly $1.3 billion in revenue for 2022-23', 'url': 'https://www.espn.com/college-sports/story/_/id/39439274/ncaa-generates-nearly-13-billion-revenue-2022-23'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: College athletes are the driving force behind the NCAA's substantial revenue.  As reported by ESPN, the NCAA generated $1.28 billion in 2022-23, largely from media rights tied to championship events. Therefore, compensating these athletes recognizes their direct contribution to this multi-billion dollar industry.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"NCAA Division I student-athletes in revenue-generating sports (football, men\\'s and women\\'s basketball) should receive a direct share of the revenue generated by their respective sport, distributed through a transparent trust fund managed by an independent third party, with individual payouts upon graduation or leaving the program, calculated based on a publicly accessible formula accounting for sport-specific revenue, team performance, and individual contribution while adhering to Title IX regulations and preserving amateur status by prohibiting direct endorsements and negotiations with professional teams while enrolled.\", \"argument\": [\"NCAA Division I student-athletes in revenue-generating sports (football, men\\'s and women\\'s basketball) should receive a direct share of the revenue generated by their respective sport, distributed through a transparent trust fund managed by an independent third party, with individual payouts upon graduation or leaving the program, calculated based on a publicly accessible formula accounting for sport-specific revenue, team performance, and individual contribution while adhering to Title IX regulations and preserving amateur status by prohibiting direct endorsements and negotiations with professional teams while enrolled.\", \"This system ensures equitable distribution of profits while maintaining amateur status and compliance with Title IX.\", \"The trust fund and independent management ensure responsible handling of funds.\", \"The transparent formula provides clarity and accountability in the distribution process.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Classifying student-athletes as employees to enable profit-sharing exposes universities to substantial legal and financial risks, especially regarding worker\\'s compensation.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Employee classification triggers legal obligations like worker\\'s compensation (Workers\\' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers).\\\\\", \\\\\"High injury rates in college sports would lead to a surge in worker\\'s compensation claims.\\\\\", \\\\\"The unpredictable costs of athlete injuries would make budgeting difficult.\\\\\", \\\\\"Articles on AthleticDirectorU highlight rising expenses in college athletics and financial pressures on non-profit institutions, which would be worsened by worker\\'s compensation claims.\\\\\", \\\\\"While profit-sharing might offset some costs, the unpredictable nature of sports revenue and injury rates makes this a risky approach.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '7_1', 'query': 'Arguments for and against profit sharing in college sports', 'title': '16 Reasons College Athletes should be Paid (And 5 Against)', 'url': 'https://helpfulprofessor.com/reasons-college-athletes-should-be-paid/'}, {'id': '7_5', 'query': 'Benefits of profit sharing for college athletes', 'title': 'Revenue Sharing: What It Means for College Athletes', 'url': 'https://nilbuckets.com/revenue-sharing-what-it-means-for-college-athletes/'}, {'id': '7_45', 'query': 'Ethical considerations of profit sharing in college sports', 'title': 'Ethical Considerations in College Sports Business: Balancing Profit and ...', 'url': 'https://jaredkamrass.org/college-sports/ethical-considerations-in-college-sports-business-balancing-profit-and-values/'}, {'id': '7_46', 'query': 'Ethical considerations of profit sharing in college sports', 'title': 'Balancing Act: The Ethics of Revenue Generation in College Sports', 'url': 'https://jaredkamrass.org/college-sports/balancing-act-the-ethics-of-revenue-generation-in-college-sports/'}]\n\n**Long Argument**: Revenue sharing recognizes athletes' contributions, partially aligning college sports with professional models, addressing exploitation concerns raised in sources like HelpfulProfessor.com. However, a trust fund with delayed payouts preserves amateurism, sidestepping issues of professionalism raised in arguments against athlete compensation. Independent, third-party management coupled with a public formula ensures both responsible fund handling and equitable, Title IX-compliant distribution, addressing ethical concerns highlighted by Jared Kamrass and ensuring fairness for all athletes while safeguarding the integrity of college sports. This model incentivizes academic focus and responsible financial planning, mitigating concerns about athletes' financial immaturity while fairly compensating their athletic contributions.  Addressing worker's compensation concerns, this structure avoids employee classification, maintaining student-athlete status and precluding such legal obligations.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Logic\n**Our

Their efforts attract fans, media, and sponsors, making them key stakeholders.  Compensating them directly through revenue sharing recognizes their contribution and ensures a fairer distribution of profits. A trust fund model, suggested in various compensation proposals, allows for managed payouts, promoting financial responsibility. This counters arguments about financial strain on athletic departments by providing a structured, controlled system that ties compensation directly to the revenue generated by the athletes themselves while mitigating potential legal and financial risks associated with employee classification.\n\n\n\n\n## Tips: \n1.

        "content": "Look, everyone, let's be real: they're talking about financial disaster and administrative mess, but their points just don't stick. They\u2019re missing out on what revenue sharing can do \u2013 it\u2019s meant to help everyone involved, right?\n\nThey claim paying athletes will bankrupt athletic departments, citing the Wall Street Journal.  But they\u2019re missing something big: Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances [1].  Get great players, get more wins, more fans, and more money \u2013 growing revenue, not losing it.  Think about it.  A winning team brings in more money. A good athletic program makes the school look better, you know, attracting more students and boosting donations. It's a win-win.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about this so-called administrative nightmare of theirs. They claim tracking revenue and distributing profits will be overly complex, citing Keepr.io.  But they\u2019re ignoring models that already work, you know. Studies show systems like ours, based on percentages, are manageable and efficient [2, 3].  Imagine a system capped at a reasonable amount, say \\$22 million \u2013 this simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.  Pro sports do revenue sharing just fine; so can colleges, right? They've got this whole thing backward.  This system isn't about creating more work; it's about bringing fairness and transparency to how these billions of dollars are distributed.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not calling student-athletes employees.  So, their worker\u2019s comp argument, from \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" doesn\u2019t apply. Our model uses a trust fund, with payouts after graduation or leaving the program. This keeps things amateur, avoiding the legal and financial risks they mentioned. Picture a transparent system with a clear formula, you know, watched by someone independent. This is responsible money management and fair distribution, not a free-for-all on lawsuits.  This directly addresses ethical concerns about fair compensation and ensures compliance with Title IX.  \n\nRemember, they brought up the financial struggles of some athletic departments.  Let's consider this: ESPN reported that the NCAA made nearly $1.3 billion in 2022-23, mostly from men\u2019s basketball [4].  Student-athletes are the heart and soul of this massive industry.  Their talent and dedication draw the fans and generate this revenue.  Imagine being a student-athlete, pouring your heart into your sport, generating millions for your school, but struggling financially. Paying them isn\u2019t about creating a burden; it\u2019s about acknowledging their contributions and sharing the wealth they help create. Our system addresses their concerns by tying compensation directly to the revenue generated.  It's a fair and responsible approach.\n\nFinally, they completely miss the mark on the bigger picture. This isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about fairness, recognizing the immense contributions of these young athletes. Think about the sacrifices they make, balancing rigorous training schedules with academic demands.  Delayed payouts through a trust fund encourage responsible financial planning and academic focus.  This is about empowering student-athletes for life after college, providing a financial safety net as they transition to their next chapter. This is about fairness, opportunity, and investing in the future of these young people who dedicate so much to their universities.\n\nIn conclusion, revenue sharing isn\u2019t a threat to college sports; it\u2019s an opportunity to build a better future. A future that\u2019s fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in creating a more just and sustainable model for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Seattle PI. (n.d.).

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nThey keep saying it's a win-win, but they're ignoring some serious money problems. They say sharing money helps schools, and they mention Seattle PI. But let's be real here.  EAB reports show many athletic departments are already in trouble, lots of Power Five schools are losing money [1].  Paying athletes will probably make things worse, maybe even leading to cuts and instability.  They're optimistic about more money, but winning isn't a sure thing, and even good programs can have money problems.  Imagine your team has a bad season. Suddenly, that extra money's gone, leaving the athletic department in more trouble.\n\nThey say their system is simple, easy to run, pointing to pro sports. But here's the difference: pro sports make money, universities are for education.  Keepr.io shows how complex profit-sharing is, needing complex accounting and legal stuff [2].  Imagine tracking every athlete, team results, gender equity, and following all the rules. This extra work will take money from important things like academics and research.  They also forget about college sports rules, which makes their \"simple\" system more complex.  Comparing it to pro sports hides the administrative mess this would actually be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about their trust fund idea, their answer to workers' compensation.  They say it keeps athletes amateur.  But Bloomberg Law shows us legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening, even without employee status [3].  A $2.75 billion settlement, anyone?  This suggests that the legal risks they dismiss are very real, regardless of how they structure the payments.  A trust fund doesn't magically erase the potential for lawsuits.  So, their claim that this avoids legal issues just doesn't hold up. Imagine you're a university facing a lawsuit from a former athlete, trust fund or not.  The legal costs and potential damage to the university's reputation are significant, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis brings me back to the financial instability of athletic departments. We\u2019ve established that many athletic departments are already struggling. The Wall Street Journal, citing Huron Consulting, found that less than half of Power Five athletic departments, the wealthiest in college sports, have adequate financial reserves [4].  Adding a substantial new expense like athlete compensation would likely exacerbate existing financial difficulties. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and staff, as highlighted by Kutak Rock\u2019s analysis, impacting opportunities for students and the university community [5].  Think about it, if departments are already struggling, how can they afford to share revenue?  The supposed revenue boost from winning is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t guarantee financial stability.  In fact, EAB points out the pressure to win can lead to overspending and even greater financial risk [1].\n\nThey talk about fairness and recognizing contributions.  Yes, student-athletes work hard. But universities already invest in them through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  The current system, though imperfect, provides substantial support. Profit-sharing adds an immense financial burden that threatens the stability of entire athletic programs, impacting not just athletes but the broader university community.  Imagine your school having to cut academic programs or increase tuition to cover the costs of profit-sharing. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, their arguments for profit-sharing fail to address the complex realities of college athletics.  The financial risks, administrative burdens, and legal vulnerabilities are simply too great to ignore.  We urge you to vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand.

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nLook, everyone, we're here today to talk about a big change needed in college sports \u2013 making things fairer and giving athletes the recognition they deserve. We firmly support the motion that student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue.\n\nFirst off, let's be clear about what we're talking about here.  We're talking about D1 athletes in sports that bring in money \u2013 mainly football and men's and women's basketball.  These athletes should get a cut of the money their sport makes, paid out through a trust fund that's run by someone else. They'd get the money after they graduate or leave, based on a formula anyone can see that looks at how much money the sport makes, how well the team does, and how much each athlete contributes.  Importantly, this keeps things fair for men and women and keeps college athletes amateur \u2013 no endorsements or talking to pro teams while they're in school.\n\nThe question we're asking is simple but important: Does this make college sports fairer and better for the future? We believe it unequivocally does. Think about this: is it really fair that these young athletes, many from poor backgrounds, aren't paid when they're the ones making the system work?\n\nWe're making three main points here. First, paying athletes recognizes how much they do for this huge, multi-billion dollar industry. Secondly, sharing revenue enhances the image and reputation of college sports. And finally, profit-sharing empowers student-athletes financially, preparing them for life beyond the game.\n\nLet me turn to our first point.  The NCAA generates staggering revenue, primarily from men\u2019s basketball. Studies in ESPN show nearly $1.28 billion was generated in 2022-23 [1]. This huge number shows just how much money college sports makes.  Who makes this happen? The athletes.  Their dedication and talent bring in the fans, sponsors, and TV viewers. Compensating them directly recognizes their integral role in this multi-billion dollar enterprise.\n\nThis brings me to our second point. Sharing the money with athletes is what people want; they want fair pay.  Research in Seton Hall Sports Poll indicates that more than half of Americans now support payments to athletes in revenue-generating sports [2].  This evolving public opinion underscores the need for change. Imagine you're a great athlete, working so hard, making millions for your school, but you can't even pay your bills. How would that feel? This shift in public perception is crucial. It fosters a more positive view of college sports, moving away from the narrative of exploitation toward a model of equity and transparency.  This improved image strengthens the integrity and long-term viability of college athletics.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the financial empowerment of student-athletes, our third point. What's really important is that this money helps athletes, especially those from families who don't have a lot.  As explained in \"Revenue Sharing: What It Means for College Athletes\", this compensation extends beyond scholarships, offering crucial financial stability [3]. Imagine you\u2019re a first-generation college student balancing rigorous academics with the demands of a high-level sport.  The added financial security allows athletes to focus on their studies, internships, and future careers, ensuring a smoother transition to life after college.  It levels the playing field, offering opportunities that extend far beyond the game.\n\nIn conclusion, compensating student-athletes is not merely a matter of fairness; it\u2019s a matter of building a more sustainable and ethical future for college sports.  It recognizes their invaluable contributions, enhances the image of college athletics, and empowers these young individuals for life beyond the court or field.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in championing a more just and equitable future for college sports.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] ESPN. (n.d.).

The Wall Street Journal found that many athletic departments already operate with limited financial reserves (\"13_7\"), so diverting significant revenue to athletes would exacerbate existing financial challenges and potentially force cuts to programs or staff.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Implementing profit-sharing necessitates complex accounting and administrative systems, creating operational challenges for universities.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'profit sharing universities administrative challenges', 'title': 'Top 4 Challenges of Profit Sharing and How to Overcome Them', 'url': 'https://keepr.io/top-4-challenges-of-profit-sharing-and-how-to-overcome-them/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Profit-sharing in universities introduces complex accounting procedures for tracking revenue distribution, as noted by Keepr.io regarding profit-sharing challenges.  This added complexity creates an administrative burden, increasing operational costs and potentially diverting resources from core educational functions.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Profit-sharing exposes universities to legal and financial liabilities, especially concerning worker's compensation, potentially reducing spending on other important programs.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_21', 'query': 'University profit sharing legal liability workers compensation', 'title': \"Protecting Your Non-Profit: A Guide to Workers' Compensation and ...\", 'url': 'https://blog.internationalinsuranceprofessionals.org/protecting-your-non-profit-a-guide-to-workers-compensation-and-employment-liability-insurance/'}, {'id': '4_24', 'query': 'University profit sharing legal liability workers compensation', 'title': \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers\", 'url': 'https://charlottencworkcomplawyersgroup.com/workers-comp-insurance-requirements-for-charlotte-employers/'}, {'id': '4_30', 'query': 'Impact of profit sharing on university spending and budgets', 'title': 'College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing', 'url': 'https://athleticdirectoru.com/articles/student-athlete-revenue-sharing/'}, {'id': '4_34', 'query': 'Impact of profit sharing on university spending and budgets', 'title': 'Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit ...', 'url': 'https://athleticdirectoru.com/articles/rethinking-rising-expenses-and-non-profit-paradox/'}]\n**Long Argument**: The argument for profit-sharing hinges on the premise that student-athletes are employees. However, this classification triggers a cascade of legal and financial ramifications, particularly concerning worker's compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers\", employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation.  Given the high rate of injuries in college sports, universities would face a substantial increase in claims, impacting their budgets as highlighted in discussions of rising athletic expenses by sources like AthleticDirectorU.  This financial strain could necessitate cuts in other essential areas, such as academic programs, scholarships, and research initiatives. Some argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, but this is uncertain given the unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and the volume of worker's compensation claims.  Furthermore, the current NCAA framework, while not without flaws, provides a level of protection against such liabilities, which would disappear with employee status. Therefore, while student-athlete compensation is a complex issue, profit-sharing introduces significant financial and legal risks that could negatively affect the broader university mission.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 493 words for the opening statement.

        "content": "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue against paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits. Sure, it sounds nice at first, but looking closer, there are some serious downsides \u2013 it could really hurt athletic departments and universities financially.  The proponents have suggested a complex system of payouts through trust funds, but this does not address the fundamental issues we will raise.\n\nBefore we get started, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. We're on the same page about focusing on Division I athletes in big-money sports like football and basketball. We should be thinking about how this affects everyone on campus \u2013 athletes, students, academics, and the university's bottom line. It's essential to look at the bigger picture so we can make a smart choice here.\n\nHere\u2019s our case in three points: One, paying athletes could destabilize athletic department finances. Two, doing this creates a huge administrative headache. And three, it opens universities up to major legal and financial risks.\n\nOkay, so first up: how paying athletes could create financial instability. The Wall Street Journal found many college athletic departments are already running on thin ice, money-wise [1].  Giving a chunk of that revenue to athletes, as suggested, would just make things worse. Think about it: if they\u2019re already struggling, how can they pay athletes too?  This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports, impacting a wider range of student-athletes. It could also force reductions in coaching staff and support services, ultimately harming the quality of athletic programs.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the nightmare of actually making this work.  Keepr.io shows how complicated it is to track where all the money goes with profit-sharing [2].  Imagine figuring out each athlete's cut based on how well they play, how the team does, and gender equity rules.  This creates mountains of paperwork, eats up money, and could take away resources from teaching and learning.  This means less money for classrooms, libraries, and research \u2013 resources that benefit all students, not just athletes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the legal and financial liability that profit-sharing creates, our third point. The proponents\u2019 argument relies on classifying student-athletes as employees.  However, this classification triggers significant legal ramifications, particularly regarding worker\u2019s compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation [3].  Given the inherent risks in college sports, the frequency of injuries is high.  Universities would face a substantial increase in worker\u2019s compensation claims.  Imagine you're a university administrator.  How do you budget for the unpredictable costs associated with athlete injuries? This financial burden is further explored in articles like \"College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing\" and \"Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox,\" both published on AthleticDirectorU [4, 5].  These articles highlight the already rising expenses in college athletics and the financial pressures faced by non-profit institutions. Adding worker\u2019s compensation claims to this equation could cripple athletic department budgets.  While some might argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, this is a risky gamble. The unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and injury rates makes this an unstable foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of compensating student-athletes may seem appealing, the practical implications of profit-sharing are fraught with financial, operational, and legal challenges. We urge you to consider the broader impact on the university ecosystem and vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huron Consulting Group. (n.d.).

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nLook, everyone, let's be real: they're talking about financial disaster and administrative mess, but their points just don't stick. They\u2019re missing out on what revenue sharing can do \u2013 it\u2019s meant to help everyone involved, right?\n\nThey claim paying athletes will bankrupt athletic departments, citing the Wall Street Journal.  But they\u2019re missing something big: Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances [1].  Get great players, get more wins, more fans, and more money \u2013 growing revenue, not losing it.  Think about it.  A winning team brings in more money. A good athletic program makes the school look better, you know, attracting more students and boosting donations. It's a win-win.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about this so-called administrative nightmare of theirs. They claim tracking revenue and distributing profits will be overly complex, citing Keepr.io.  But they\u2019re ignoring models that already work, you know. Studies show systems like ours, based on percentages, are manageable and efficient [2, 3].  Imagine a system capped at a reasonable amount, say \\$22 million \u2013 this simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.  Pro sports do revenue sharing just fine; so can colleges, right? They've got this whole thing backward.  This system isn't about creating more work; it's about bringing fairness and transparency to how these billions of dollars are distributed.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not calling student-athletes employees.  So, their worker\u2019s comp argument, from \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" doesn\u2019t apply. Our model uses a trust fund, with payouts after graduation or leaving the program. This keeps things amateur, avoiding the legal and financial risks they mentioned. Picture a transparent system with a clear formula, you know, watched by someone independent. This is responsible money management and fair distribution, not a free-for-all on lawsuits.  This directly addresses ethical concerns about fair compensation and ensures compliance with Title IX.  \n\nRemember, they brought up the financial struggles of some athletic departments.  Let's consider this: ESPN reported that the NCAA made nearly $1.3 billion in 2022-23, mostly from men\u2019s basketball [4].  Student-athletes are the heart and soul of this massive industry.  Their talent and dedication draw the fans and generate this revenue.  Imagine being a student-athlete, pouring your heart into your sport, generating millions for your school, but struggling financially. Paying them isn\u2019t about creating a burden; it\u2019s about acknowledging their contributions and sharing the wealth they help create. Our system addresses their concerns by tying compensation directly to the revenue generated.  It's a fair and responsible approach.\n\nFinally, they completely miss the mark on the bigger picture. This isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about fairness, recognizing the immense contributions of these young athletes. Think about the sacrifices they make, balancing rigorous training schedules with academic demands.  Delayed payouts through a trust fund encourage responsible financial planning and academic focus.  This is about empowering student-athletes for life after college, providing a financial safety net as they transition to their next chapter. This is about fairness, opportunity, and investing in the future of these young people who dedicate so much to their universities.\n\nIn conclusion, revenue sharing isn\u2019t a threat to college sports; it\u2019s an opportunity to build a better future.

        "content": "Now it comes the rebuttal phase, where you respond to your opponent. You should stand firm on your position (OPPOSE the motion) and attack the opponent's weak points.\nYour position is to OPPOSE the motion. The opponent is to SUPPORT the motion.\n\n\n## Knowledge\n### Structure of a Rebuttal\nA complete rebuttal should consist of multiple points, with each point containing four parts:\n- **Lead-in:** Introduce the opponent's argument, evidence, reasoning, etc., that you will be refuting.\n- **Explanation:** Briefly explain the opponent's argument to ensure clarity.\n- **Rebuttal:** This is the core of your point. Utilize rebuttal techniques to directly challenge the opponent's claim.\n- **Impact:** Concisely summarize the impact of your rebuttal and how it benefits your side.\n\nNote: Typically, the lead-in and explanation are combined into one sentence. The rebuttal is the most crucial part, and the impact summarizes its effect.\n\n### Rebuttal Techniques\n- **Pointing out logical fallacies:** Identify errors in the opponent's reasoning, such as reversing cause and effect, equivocation (shifting the meaning of a key term), straw man arguments, circular reasoning, or tautology (repeating the same idea in different words).\n- **Pointing out factual errors:** Highlight inaccuracies or weaknesses in the opponent's evidence, such as insufficient data, incorrect facts, or biased sources.\n- **Leveling the playing field:** This technique aims to neutralize the opponent's advantage or minimize the perceived harm of your side's position by demonstrating that both sides share the same issue or benefit.\n    - **Example 1:** \"You claim A, but B also has this problem. Therefore, both sides are equal in this regard, both having the issue.\"\n    - **Example 2:** \"You mention the benefits of A, but B also offers the same benefits. So, both sides are equal in this aspect, both being advantageous.\"\n\n## Rules \n- Ensure your rebuttal speech flows naturally, resembling human language. Avoid mechanically or formulaically applying the 'cite-interpret-refute-conclude' structure; instead, integrate it seamlessly into your writing.\n- When citing data or academic research to support your rebuttals, provide clear sources. Do not reference materials that are not present in the given context.\n\n## Workflow \n1. Structure your response according to the Plan, connecting the given Arguments with minimal transitions to maintain flow. Do not add new evidence.\n2. Transform arguments into conversational yet language suitable for public speaking.Write as you would speak, with VARIED sentence lengths. Short sentences are preferred. Use ORATORICAL language while keeping the original argument sequence. \n3. Use clear verbal signposting. Use clear transitions: 'Let me turn to ', 'This brings me to'. Include listener-oriented phrases: 'As you'll see ', 'Consider this '. Signal key points: 'The crucial issue here is ', 'What's particularly important '. \n4. You SHOULD connect with your audience by:\n- Reframe some scenarios of the evidence to directly involve the audience by using 'you' as the protagonist and describing how the situation would impact their lives, making abstract concepts personally relevant and emotionally resonant.- Use analogies, metaphors, or vivid imagery to make complex ideas more accessible and memorable.5. Remove duplicate evidence or statements across different actions of the plan. \n6. Maintain proportional argument lengths as specified in the plan (short < medium < long).\n7. Renumber the original citations to [1],[2], ... and use the following citation format:\n- In text: Use journal names if the **jounral** key of the evidence is not empty\n- Include phrases like 'Studies show' or 'Research indicates'\n- List full references in **Reference** section. This section should start with **Reference**. \n8. Deliver a 519-word rebuttal statement. After the rebuttal statement, include a separate **Reference** section which does not count toward the 519 word limit. The response should be written in clear, flowing transcript for the competitive debate game of prose without any bullet points, asterisks, or numbered lists.  Present only the final text.\n\n## Rebuttal Plans: \n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"The proposed model does not classify student-athletes as employees, avoiding worker\\'s compensation issues.\", \"argument\": [\"The model uses a trust fund with payouts after graduation or leaving the program.\", \"This maintains amateur status and avoids legal and financial risks associated with employee classification.\", \"The trust fund approach encourages responsible financial planning and academic focus.\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '4_3', 'query': 'Universities legal liabilities profit sharing employees', 'title': 'NCAA Settlement Bolsters Bids to Treat Athletes as Employees', 'url': 'https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/ncaa-settlement-bolsters-bids-to-treat-athletes-as-employees'}]\n**Short Argument**: The claim that the trust fund model avoids worker's compensation issues is dubious.  Bloomberg Law (news.bloomberglaw.com) reports on a $2.75 billion settlement addressing athlete compensation, indicating legal challenges persist despite the NCAA's amateurism model.  This demonstrates ongoing legal vulnerability regarding athlete compensation, regardless of employee classification.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"Revenue sharing in college athletics is beneficial and will not lead to financial disaster or administrative mess.\", \"argument\": [\"It can boost university finances by increasing wins, fans, and overall revenue.\", \"A successful athletic program enhances the university\\'s image, attracting more students and donations.\", \"Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances.\", \"Increased revenue from more wins and fans will offset the cost of paying athletes.\", \"A good athletic program attracts more students and donations, further boosting revenue.\", \"Seattle PI studies support the positive financial impact of paying athletes.\", \"Models based on percentages are manageable and efficient.\", \"A capped system simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.\", \"Professional sports successfully implement revenue sharing, demonstrating its feasibility.\", \"Studies show systems like the proposed one are manageable and efficient.\", \"It provides a transparent system with a clear formula overseen by an independent entity.\", \"It ensures responsible money management and fair distribution.\", \"It acknowledges the contributions of student-athletes and shares the wealth they help create.\", \"The NCAA generated nearly $1.3 billion in revenue in 2022-23, largely from men\\'s basketball.\", \"Student-athletes are the core of this industry, their talent and dedication driving fan engagement and revenue.\", \"Paying them acknowledges their contributions and shares the wealth they create.\", \"The proposed system ties compensation directly to revenue generated, ensuring fairness.\", \"It addresses financial concerns by tying compensation to revenue.\", \"It promotes fairness by recognizing student-athletes\\' contributions.\", \"It encourages responsible financial planning through delayed payouts.\", \"It invests in the future of young athletes by providing a financial safety net.\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '13_37', 'query': 'Examples of financial challenges faced by athletic departments due to fluctuating revenue', 'title': \"It's time to ask tough questions about college athletic programs | EAB\", 'url': 'https://eab.com/resources/research-report/tough-questions-about-athletic-programs/'}]\n**Short Argument**: The claim that revenue sharing won't lead to financial disaster ignores the precarious financial state of many athletic departments.  \"The Washington Post found 25 institutions in Power Five conferences ran athletic departments with deficits\" (13_37).  Adding significant new expenses like athlete compensation to already strained budgets will likely exacerbate these deficits and could lead to program cuts and further instability.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Profit-sharing could create financial instability for athletic departments.\", \"argument\": [\"Many athletic departments already operate with tight budgets (Huron Consulting Group).\", \"Sharing revenue would exacerbate existing financial challenges, potentially leading to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and other programs.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Revenue sharing in college athletics is beneficial and will not lead to financial disaster or administrative mess.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"It can boost university finances by increasing wins, fans, and overall revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"A successful athletic program enhances the university\\'s image, attracting more students and donations.\\\\\", \\\\\"Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances.\\\\\", \\\\\"Increased revenue from more wins and fans will offset the cost of paying athletes.\\\\\", \\\\\"A good athletic program attracts more students and donations, further boosting revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Seattle PI studies support the positive financial impact of paying athletes.\\\\\", \\\\\"Models based on percentages are manageable and efficient.\\\\\", \\\\\"A capped system simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"Professional sports successfully implement revenue sharing, demonstrating its feasibility.\\\\\", \\\\\"Studies show systems like the proposed one are manageable and efficient.\\\\\", \\\\\"It provides a transparent system with a clear formula overseen by an independent entity.\\\\\", \\\\\"It ensures responsible money management and fair distribution.\\\\\", \\\\\"It acknowledges the contributions of student-athletes and shares the wealth they help create.\\\\\", \\\\\"The NCAA generated nearly $1.3 billion in revenue in 2022-23, largely from men\\'s basketball.\\\\\", \\\\\"Student-athletes are the core of this industry, their talent and dedication driving fan engagement and revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Paying them acknowledges their contributions and shares the wealth they create.\\\\\", \\\\\"The proposed system ties compensation directly to revenue generated, ensuring fairness.\\\\\", \\\\\"It addresses financial concerns by tying compensation to revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"It promotes fairness by recognizing student-athletes\\' contributions.\\\\\", \\\\\"It encourages responsible financial planning through delayed payouts.\\\\\", \\\\\"It invests in the future of young athletes by providing a financial safety net.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Paying athletes will not bankrupt athletic departments.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Increased revenue from more wins and fans will offset the cost of paying athletes.\\\\\", \\\\\"A good athletic program attracts more students and donations, further boosting revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Seattle PI studies support the positive financial impact of paying athletes.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Student-athletes deserve to be compensated for their contributions to the massive revenue generated by college sports.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"The NCAA generated nearly $1.3 billion in revenue in 2022-23, largely from men\\'s basketball.\\\\\", \\\\\"Student-athletes are the core of this industry, their talent and dedication driving fan engagement and revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"Paying them acknowledges their contributions and shares the wealth they create.\\\\\", \\\\\"The proposed system ties compensation directly to revenue generated, ensuring fairness.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The proposed revenue-sharing model is fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"It addresses financial concerns by tying compensation to revenue.\\\\\", \\\\\"It promotes fairness by recognizing student-athletes\\' contributions.\\\\\", \\\\\"It encourages responsible financial planning through delayed payouts.\\\\\", \\\\\"It invests in the future of young athletes by providing a financial safety net.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '13_5', 'query': 'Financial instability in athletic departments', 'title': \"It's time to ask tough questions about college athletic programs | EAB\", 'url': 'https://eab.com/resources/research-report/tough-questions-about-athletic-programs/'}, {'id': '13_25', 'query': 'Potential negative impacts of revenue sharing on non-revenue generating college sports', 'title': 'The Implications of the NCAA Antitrust Settlement -

'https://www.kutakrock.com/newspublications/publications/2024/june/the-implications-of-the-ncaa-antitrust-settlement'}]\n**Long Argument**: The Huron Consulting Group, a leading expert in higher education finance, reports that many athletic departments operate with precarious budgets. Their analysis, cited by the Wall Street Journal, reveals that less than half of Power Five athletic departments and even fewer Group of Five departments have built financial reserves.  This finding indicates a systemic vulnerability within college athletics finances. Implementing a profit-sharing model, while potentially beneficial to student-athletes in revenue-generating sports, would likely exacerbate the financial strain on athletic departments. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue-generating sports, as highlighted by Kutak Rock's analysis of the NCAA antitrust settlement, potentially diminishing opportunities for student-athletes and negatively impacting program diversity. While some argue that increased revenue from successful athletic programs could offset these costs, the existing financial instability, coupled with the added expense of profit-sharing, suggests that many departments would struggle to maintain current program offerings, let alone expand them. This financial strain could also lead to increased reliance on institutional subsidies, further diverting resources from other crucial areas of the university.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Logic\n**Our Logic Chain to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Profit-sharing exposes universities to legal and financial liabilities, especially concerning worker\\'s compensation, potentially reducing spending on other important programs.\", \"argument\": [\"Classifying student-athletes as employees triggers worker\\'s compensation obligations (Charlotte NC Workers Compensation Lawyers Group).\", \"Increased worker\\'s compensation claims, due to the high injury rate in college sports, would strain athletic department budgets (AthleticDirectorU).\", \"This financial burden could divert resources from academics and other university programs.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The proposed model does not classify student-athletes as employees, avoiding worker\\'s compensation issues.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"The model uses a trust fund with payouts after graduation or leaving the program.\\\\\", \\\\\"This maintains amateur status and avoids legal and financial risks associated with employee classification.\\\\\", \\\\\"The trust fund approach encourages responsible financial planning and academic focus.\\\\\"]}\"]}', '{\"claim\": \"Implementing profit-sharing necessitates complex accounting and administrative systems, creating operational challenges for universities.\", \"argument\": [\"Tracking revenue and distributing profits based on various factors (performance, gender equity) is complex (Keepr.io).\", \"This complexity creates administrative overhead, diverting resources from core university functions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Tracking revenue and distributing profits will not be an administrative nightmare.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Models based on percentages are manageable and efficient.\\\\\", \\\\\"A capped system simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"Professional sports successfully implement revenue sharing, demonstrating its feasibility.\\\\\", \\\\\"Studies show systems like the proposed one are manageable and efficient.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'profit sharing universities administrative challenges', 'title': 'Top 4 Challenges of Profit Sharing and How to Overcome Them', 'url': 'https://keepr.io/top-4-challenges-of-profit-sharing-and-how-to-overcome-them/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Universities face increased administrative burden with profit-sharing. Keepr.io highlights the complex calculations and legal compliance required for setup and management.  This administrative complexity diverts resources from core university functions like education and research.\n\n\n\n\n## Tips: \n1. You can rewrite scenarios or examples from your opening statement to reinforce key points.

        "content": "They keep saying it's a win-win, but they're ignoring some serious money problems. They say sharing money helps schools, and they mention Seattle PI. But let's be real here.  EAB reports show many athletic departments are already in trouble, lots of Power Five schools are losing money [1].  Paying athletes will probably make things worse, maybe even leading to cuts and instability.  They're optimistic about more money, but winning isn't a sure thing, and even good programs can have money problems.  Imagine your team has a bad season. Suddenly, that extra money's gone, leaving the athletic department in more trouble.\n\nThey say their system is simple, easy to run, pointing to pro sports. But here's the difference: pro sports make money, universities are for education.  Keepr.io shows how complex profit-sharing is, needing complex accounting and legal stuff [2].  Imagine tracking every athlete, team results, gender equity, and following all the rules. This extra work will take money from important things like academics and research.  They also forget about college sports rules, which makes their \"simple\" system more complex.  Comparing it to pro sports hides the administrative mess this would actually be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about their trust fund idea, their answer to workers' compensation.  They say it keeps athletes amateur.  But Bloomberg Law shows us legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening, even without employee status [3].  A $2.75 billion settlement, anyone?  This suggests that the legal risks they dismiss are very real, regardless of how they structure the payments.  A trust fund doesn't magically erase the potential for lawsuits.  So, their claim that this avoids legal issues just doesn't hold up. Imagine you're a university facing a lawsuit from a former athlete, trust fund or not.  The legal costs and potential damage to the university's reputation are significant, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis brings me back to the financial instability of athletic departments. We\u2019ve established that many athletic departments are already struggling. The Wall Street Journal, citing Huron Consulting, found that less than half of Power Five athletic departments, the wealthiest in college sports, have adequate financial reserves [4].  Adding a substantial new expense like athlete compensation would likely exacerbate existing financial difficulties. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and staff, as highlighted by Kutak Rock\u2019s analysis, impacting opportunities for students and the university community [5].  Think about it, if departments are already struggling, how can they afford to share revenue?  The supposed revenue boost from winning is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t guarantee financial stability.  In fact, EAB points out the pressure to win can lead to overspending and even greater financial risk [1].\n\nThey talk about fairness and recognizing contributions.  Yes, student-athletes work hard. But universities already invest in them through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  The current system, though imperfect, provides substantial support. Profit-sharing adds an immense financial burden that threatens the stability of entire athletic programs, impacting not just athletes but the broader university community.  Imagine your school having to cut academic programs or increase tuition to cover the costs of profit-sharing. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, their arguments for profit-sharing fail to address the complex realities of college athletics.  The financial risks, administrative burdens, and legal vulnerabilities are simply too great to ignore.  We urge you to vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

        "content": "Look, it all comes down to this: can we really afford to pay student-athletes?  We've shown that the financial risks, the extra admin work, and the legal issues with profit-sharing are just too much. They talk about fairness, but they don't get the money problems universities face.  Many athletic departments are already on a tight budget, you know? Adding profit-sharing would make things worse, maybe leading to program cuts and instability.  Imagine your school cutting sports or raising tuition to pay athletes, right? How is that fair, really?\n\nThey claim revenue sharing will boost university funds.  But they haven't shown how more money will be greater than the costs of their system. Remember, EAB\u2019s research highlights the financial struggles of many athletic departments, even in Power Five conferences [1].  They're optimistic about more money, but they're ignoring the current financial pressures. They point to pro sports, but they don't get the differences between pro leagues and college sports. Universities have different priorities, budgets, and legal stuff.  Their trust fund idea doesn't magically stop lawsuits.  Bloomberg Law\u2019s report on the NCAA settlement shows that legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening [2].  A trust fund won't change that.\n\nWe acknowledge the contributions of student-athletes.  They dedicate immense time and effort to their sports. But universities already invest a lot in these students through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  Profit-sharing adds a huge financial burden, hurting sports programs and maybe taking money from academics. We need to consider how this affects the whole university community.  We urge you to vote against this motion and support a financially sustainable future for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

        "Look, everyone, we're here today to talk about a big change needed in college sports \u2013 making things fairer and giving athletes the recognition they deserve. We firmly support the motion that student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue.\n\nFirst off, let's be clear about what we're talking about here.  We're talking about D1 athletes in sports that bring in money \u2013 mainly football and men's and women's basketball.  These athletes should get a cut of the money their sport makes, paid out through a trust fund that's run by someone else. They'd get the money after they graduate or leave, based on a formula anyone can see that looks at how much money the sport makes, how well the team does, and how much each athlete contributes.  Importantly, this keeps things fair for men and women and keeps college athletes amateur \u2013 no endorsements or talking to pro teams while they're in school.\n\nThe question we're asking is simple but important: Does this make college sports fairer and better for the future? We believe it unequivocally does. Think about this: is it really fair that these young athletes, many from poor backgrounds, aren't paid when they're the ones making the system work?\n\nWe're making three main points here. First, paying athletes recognizes how much they do for this huge, multi-billion dollar industry. Secondly, sharing revenue enhances the image and reputation of college sports. And finally, profit-sharing empowers student-athletes financially, preparing them for life beyond the game.\n\nLet me turn to our first point.  The NCAA generates staggering revenue, primarily from men\u2019s basketball. Studies in ESPN show nearly $1.28 billion was generated in 2022-23 [1]. This huge number shows just how much money college sports makes.  Who makes this happen? The athletes.  Their dedication and talent bring in the fans, sponsors, and TV viewers. Compensating them directly recognizes their integral role in this multi-billion dollar enterprise.\n\nThis brings me to our second point. Sharing the money with athletes is what people want; they want fair pay.  Research in Seton Hall Sports Poll indicates that more than half of Americans now support payments to athletes in revenue-generating sports [2].  This evolving public opinion underscores the need for change. Imagine you're a great athlete, working so hard, making millions for your school, but you can't even pay your bills. How would that feel? This shift in public perception is crucial. It fosters a more positive view of college sports, moving away from the narrative of exploitation toward a model of equity and transparency.  This improved image strengthens the integrity and long-term viability of college athletics.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the financial empowerment of student-athletes, our third point. What's really important is that this money helps athletes, especially those from families who don't have a lot.  As explained in \"Revenue Sharing: What It Means for College Athletes\", this compensation extends beyond scholarships, offering crucial financial stability [3]. Imagine you\u2019re a first-generation college student balancing rigorous academics with the demands of a high-level sport.  The added financial security allows athletes to focus on their studies, internships, and future careers, ensuring a smoother transition to life after college.  It levels the playing field, offering opportunities that extend far beyond the game.\n\nIn conclusion, compensating student-athletes is not merely a matter of fairness; it\u2019s a matter of building a more sustainable and ethical future for college sports.  It recognizes their invaluable contributions, enhances the image of college athletics, and empowers these young individuals for life beyond the court or field.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in championing a more just and equitable future for college sports.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] ESPN. (n.d.).

        "Look, everyone, let's be real: they're talking about financial disaster and administrative mess, but their points just don't stick. They\u2019re missing out on what revenue sharing can do \u2013 it\u2019s meant to help everyone involved, right?\n\nThey claim paying athletes will bankrupt athletic departments, citing the Wall Street Journal.  But they\u2019re missing something big: Seattle PI studies show that paying athletes can boost university finances [1].  Get great players, get more wins, more fans, and more money \u2013 growing revenue, not losing it.  Think about it.  A winning team brings in more money. A good athletic program makes the school look better, you know, attracting more students and boosting donations. It's a win-win.\n\nOkay, let\u2019s talk about this so-called administrative nightmare of theirs. They claim tracking revenue and distributing profits will be overly complex, citing Keepr.io.  But they\u2019re ignoring models that already work, you know. Studies show systems like ours, based on percentages, are manageable and efficient [2, 3].  Imagine a system capped at a reasonable amount, say \\$22 million \u2013 this simplifies administration and leverages existing resources.  Pro sports do revenue sharing just fine; so can colleges, right? They've got this whole thing backward.  This system isn't about creating more work; it's about bringing fairness and transparency to how these billions of dollars are distributed.\n\nLet me be clear: we're not calling student-athletes employees.  So, their worker\u2019s comp argument, from \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" doesn\u2019t apply. Our model uses a trust fund, with payouts after graduation or leaving the program. This keeps things amateur, avoiding the legal and financial risks they mentioned. Picture a transparent system with a clear formula, you know, watched by someone independent. This is responsible money management and fair distribution, not a free-for-all on lawsuits.  This directly addresses ethical concerns about fair compensation and ensures compliance with Title IX.  \n\nRemember, they brought up the financial struggles of some athletic departments.  Let's consider this: ESPN reported that the NCAA made nearly $1.3 billion in 2022-23, mostly from men\u2019s basketball [4].  Student-athletes are the heart and soul of this massive industry.  Their talent and dedication draw the fans and generate this revenue.  Imagine being a student-athlete, pouring your heart into your sport, generating millions for your school, but struggling financially. Paying them isn\u2019t about creating a burden; it\u2019s about acknowledging their contributions and sharing the wealth they help create. Our system addresses their concerns by tying compensation directly to the revenue generated.  It's a fair and responsible approach.\n\nFinally, they completely miss the mark on the bigger picture. This isn\u2019t just about money; it\u2019s about fairness, recognizing the immense contributions of these young athletes. Think about the sacrifices they make, balancing rigorous training schedules with academic demands.  Delayed payouts through a trust fund encourage responsible financial planning and academic focus.  This is about empowering student-athletes for life after college, providing a financial safety net as they transition to their next chapter. This is about fairness, opportunity, and investing in the future of these young people who dedicate so much to their universities.\n\nIn conclusion, revenue sharing isn\u2019t a threat to college sports; it\u2019s an opportunity to build a better future. A future that\u2019s fair, equitable, and financially sound for all involved.  We urge you to support this motion and join us in creating a more just and sustainable model for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Seattle PI. (n.d.).

        "Look, it all comes down to this: do we value the athletes behind the billion-dollar college sports industry? We say yes. They're saying no, stuck on old ideas about amateurism, ignoring today's money problems and ethical issues.\n\nThey bring up financial ruin, but we've shown revenue sharing can boost university funds, getting talent and more donations. They say it'll be chaos, but we've shown models that work, like in pro sports and that plan from Deseret News [1].  Their worries about worker's comp are baseless; our trust fund with delayed payouts keeps student status, avoiding legal issues.\n\nRemember, ESPN said the NCAA made almost $1.3 billion, thanks to the athletes they won't pay fairly [2]. Our plan makes sure these athletes, especially those struggling, get a share of the wealth they create. Imagine that: training, competing, upholding the university's image, all while broke. This plan fixes that, right?\n\nThey talk about the current system providing support. Is it enough when athletes, the heart of this billion-dollar thing, are often left financially vulnerable?  Our plan gives athletes financial security, letting them focus on school and life after sports.  Imagine: graduating with a degree and the money to chase your dreams.\n\nThey're stuck on the status quo, a system full of ethical issues and financial unfairness.  We offer a way forward, where student-athletes get recognized and rewarded. A future where college sports is profitable, fair, and just, you know? We urge you to support this motion and join us in championing a more equitable future for college athletics.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Deseret News. (2024, September 25).

        "Hey everyone, we're here today to argue against paying student-athletes a share of college sports profits. Sure, it sounds nice at first, but looking closer, there are some serious downsides \u2013 it could really hurt athletic departments and universities financially.  The proponents have suggested a complex system of payouts through trust funds, but this does not address the fundamental issues we will raise.\n\nBefore we get started, let's be clear about what we're talking about here. We're on the same page about focusing on Division I athletes in big-money sports like football and basketball. We should be thinking about how this affects everyone on campus \u2013 athletes, students, academics, and the university's bottom line. It's essential to look at the bigger picture so we can make a smart choice here.\n\nHere\u2019s our case in three points: One, paying athletes could destabilize athletic department finances. Two, doing this creates a huge administrative headache. And three, it opens universities up to major legal and financial risks.\n\nOkay, so first up: how paying athletes could create financial instability. The Wall Street Journal found many college athletic departments are already running on thin ice, money-wise [1].  Giving a chunk of that revenue to athletes, as suggested, would just make things worse. Think about it: if they\u2019re already struggling, how can they pay athletes too?  This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports, impacting a wider range of student-athletes. It could also force reductions in coaching staff and support services, ultimately harming the quality of athletic programs.\n\nNext, let\u2019s talk about the nightmare of actually making this work.  Keepr.io shows how complicated it is to track where all the money goes with profit-sharing [2].  Imagine figuring out each athlete's cut based on how well they play, how the team does, and gender equity rules.  This creates mountains of paperwork, eats up money, and could take away resources from teaching and learning.  This means less money for classrooms, libraries, and research \u2013 resources that benefit all students, not just athletes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the legal and financial liability that profit-sharing creates, our third point. The proponents\u2019 argument relies on classifying student-athletes as employees.  However, this classification triggers significant legal ramifications, particularly regarding worker\u2019s compensation.  As detailed in \"Workers' Comp Insurance Requirements for Charlotte Employers,\" employers are legally obligated to provide worker's compensation [3].  Given the inherent risks in college sports, the frequency of injuries is high.  Universities would face a substantial increase in worker\u2019s compensation claims.  Imagine you're a university administrator.  How do you budget for the unpredictable costs associated with athlete injuries? This financial burden is further explored in articles like \"College Athletics Spending And The Movement Towards Revenue Sharing\" and \"Rethinking The Rising Expenses In College Athletics And The Non-Profit Paradox,\" both published on AthleticDirectorU [4, 5].  These articles highlight the already rising expenses in college athletics and the financial pressures faced by non-profit institutions. Adding worker\u2019s compensation claims to this equation could cripple athletic department budgets.  While some might argue that profit-sharing itself could offset these costs, this is a risky gamble. The unpredictable nature of both sports revenue and injury rates makes this an unstable foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of compensating student-athletes may seem appealing, the practical implications of profit-sharing are fraught with financial, operational, and legal challenges. We urge you to consider the broader impact on the university ecosystem and vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Huron Consulting Group. (n.d.).

        "They keep saying it's a win-win, but they're ignoring some serious money problems. They say sharing money helps schools, and they mention Seattle PI. But let's be real here.  EAB reports show many athletic departments are already in trouble, lots of Power Five schools are losing money [1].  Paying athletes will probably make things worse, maybe even leading to cuts and instability.  They're optimistic about more money, but winning isn't a sure thing, and even good programs can have money problems.  Imagine your team has a bad season. Suddenly, that extra money's gone, leaving the athletic department in more trouble.\n\nThey say their system is simple, easy to run, pointing to pro sports. But here's the difference: pro sports make money, universities are for education.  Keepr.io shows how complex profit-sharing is, needing complex accounting and legal stuff [2].  Imagine tracking every athlete, team results, gender equity, and following all the rules. This extra work will take money from important things like academics and research.  They also forget about college sports rules, which makes their \"simple\" system more complex.  Comparing it to pro sports hides the administrative mess this would actually be.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about their trust fund idea, their answer to workers' compensation.  They say it keeps athletes amateur.  But Bloomberg Law shows us legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening, even without employee status [3].  A $2.75 billion settlement, anyone?  This suggests that the legal risks they dismiss are very real, regardless of how they structure the payments.  A trust fund doesn't magically erase the potential for lawsuits.  So, their claim that this avoids legal issues just doesn't hold up. Imagine you're a university facing a lawsuit from a former athlete, trust fund or not.  The legal costs and potential damage to the university's reputation are significant, regardless of the outcome.\n\nThis brings me back to the financial instability of athletic departments. We\u2019ve established that many athletic departments are already struggling. The Wall Street Journal, citing Huron Consulting, found that less than half of Power Five athletic departments, the wealthiest in college sports, have adequate financial reserves [4].  Adding a substantial new expense like athlete compensation would likely exacerbate existing financial difficulties. This could lead to cuts in non-revenue generating sports and staff, as highlighted by Kutak Rock\u2019s analysis, impacting opportunities for students and the university community [5].  Think about it, if departments are already struggling, how can they afford to share revenue?  The supposed revenue boost from winning is unpredictable and doesn\u2019t guarantee financial stability.  In fact, EAB points out the pressure to win can lead to overspending and even greater financial risk [1].\n\nThey talk about fairness and recognizing contributions.  Yes, student-athletes work hard. But universities already invest in them through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  The current system, though imperfect, provides substantial support. Profit-sharing adds an immense financial burden that threatens the stability of entire athletic programs, impacting not just athletes but the broader university community.  Imagine your school having to cut academic programs or increase tuition to cover the costs of profit-sharing. That\u2019s not fair to anyone.\n\nIn conclusion, their arguments for profit-sharing fail to address the complex realities of college athletics.  The financial risks, administrative burdens, and legal vulnerabilities are simply too great to ignore.  We urge you to vote against this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] EAB. (n.d.).

        "Look, it all comes down to this: can we really afford to pay student-athletes?  We've shown that the financial risks, the extra admin work, and the legal issues with profit-sharing are just too much. They talk about fairness, but they don't get the money problems universities face.  Many athletic departments are already on a tight budget, you know? Adding profit-sharing would make things worse, maybe leading to program cuts and instability.  Imagine your school cutting sports or raising tuition to pay athletes, right? How is that fair, really?\n\nThey claim revenue sharing will boost university funds.  But they haven't shown how more money will be greater than the costs of their system. Remember, EAB\u2019s research highlights the financial struggles of many athletic departments, even in Power Five conferences [1].  They're optimistic about more money, but they're ignoring the current financial pressures. They point to pro sports, but they don't get the differences between pro leagues and college sports. Universities have different priorities, budgets, and legal stuff.  Their trust fund idea doesn't magically stop lawsuits.  Bloomberg Law\u2019s report on the NCAA settlement shows that legal battles over athlete compensation are already happening [2].  A trust fund won't change that.\n\nWe acknowledge the contributions of student-athletes.  They dedicate immense time and effort to their sports. But universities already invest a lot in these students through scholarships, facilities, and coaching.  Profit-sharing adds a huge financial burden, hurting sports programs and maybe taking money from academics. We need to consider how this affects the whole university community.
