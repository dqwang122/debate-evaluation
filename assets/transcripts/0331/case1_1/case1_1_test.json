      "content": "Every year, countless children suffer preventable harm due to parental negligence. Today, we argue that holding parents accountable is crucial to building a safer future for our children. By \"parents,\" we mean legal guardians with custodial responsibility. \"Responsible\" signifies accountability for taking proactive measures. This could entail taking parenting courses, participating in family counseling, or adhering to court-mandated restrictions on their child's activities. \"Harmful actions\" refers to unlawful or reckless behaviors causing demonstrable harm.\n\nOur judging criterion centers on which framework demonstrably leads to greater well-being and safety for children and society. We believe proactive prevention trumps reactive punishment.\n\nParental responsibility acts as a powerful catalyst for positive change. First, it encourages early intervention. Early intervention is like preventative healthcare; addressing minor behavioral problems early can prevent significant issues later.\n\nSecond, it compels active supervision, reducing negligence. One in three accidents are due to parental negligence. The prospect of responsibility motivates parents to actively monitor and guide their children, minimizing harm.\n\nFinally, it incentivizes parents to teach responsible digital citizenship. Children younger than 11 who use social media are more likely to have problematic digital behaviors, like online-only friends and cyberbullying . Parents must create a Family Media Plan to encourage critical thinking about media consumption .\n\nTherefore, we urge you to support policies and initiatives that empower parents to be responsible and engaged members of their children\u2019s lives, creating a safer and more nurturing environment for all.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Eshleman, Kate. \"How Social Media Can Negatively Affect Your Child.\" *Cleveland Clinic*, January 15, 2024.\n[2] \"Family guide: 5 strategies for setting digital media boundaries and guidelines for kids.\" *Digital Parenthood*."

      "content": "We argue that blaming parents for the harmful actions of their children is both ineffective and deeply unfair. Instead, we propose a system of support, guidance, and restorative justice that addresses the root causes of these actions. To clarify, \"parents\" encompasses all primary caregivers, including grandparents and foster parents. \"Responsible\" means prioritizing resources and support, not just punishment. This expanded definition is crucial because simply punishing parents doesn't address the underlying issues. \"Harmful actions\" include emotional and psychological harm, not just illegal acts. Our judging criterion should consider long-term developmental impacts.\n\nSocioeconomic factors significantly limit a parent's control. A parent working multiple jobs cannot provide the same supervision as a parent with more resources. Like a gardener with poor soil, parents facing poverty or discrimination struggle to provide an optimal environment, no matter how hard they try.\n\nChildren learn responsibility best through guidance, not punishment. Consider a child who rebelled under strict control versus one who thrived with supportive mentorship. Supportive guidance consistently promotes responsible behavior.\n\nFocusing on blame undermines restorative justice. Instead of focusing on who broke a vase, a restorative approach asks: How can we prevent it from happening again? Similarly, instead of punishing parents, we should invest in programs that address the root causes of harmful actions, such as poverty and lack of educational opportunities.\n\nTherefore, we urge you to reject blame and embrace support, guidance, and restorative justice.\n\n**Reference**\n[1]"

      "content": "Our opponents misunderstand the core issue. Let\u2019s clarify our terms to ensure a fair debate. We define \"parents\" as legal guardians with custodial responsibility, not broadly as all caregivers. \"Responsible\" means proactive accountability, not just mere support. \"Harmful actions\" are demonstrable unlawful or reckless behaviors, not vague emotional harm. These clear definitions ensure enforceable standards focused on those with the most direct influence.\n\nImmediate well-being and safety are paramount. Long-term impacts are secondary when a child's actions cause immediate harm.\n\nNow, to their claims. They say blaming parents is ineffective. But responsibility is the catalyst for prevention. Support without accountability is toothless. Consider this: elementary students with screens in their bedrooms perform worse on tests . This highlights the need for parental supervision.\n\nLet's turn to the socioeconomic argument. Poverty is a factor, but it doesn't negate fundamental parental duties. Excusing responsibility creates a dangerous precedent. In reality, accountability can incentivize community support and governmental assistance that can make childcare cheaper.\n\nGuidance alone, without accountability, breeds entitlement. You cannot ignore conscious choices children make. Parental responsibility ensures victims receive justice.\n\nRestorative justice is valuable, but accountability is essential for preventing future harm. Parental responsibility is a prerequisite for effective restorative justice.\n\nParental responsibility encourages early intervention, compels active supervision, reducing tragic accidents, and incentivizes parents to teach responsible digital citizenship. Do we prioritize proactive prevention, or reactive support? We must choose prevention.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Jill Christensen, APRN, C.N.P. \"Children and too much screen time.\" *Mayo Clinic Health System*, May 28, 2021."

      "content": "Let's address the opposition's misunderstanding of this complex issue. They argue that parental responsibility is the key to prevention, but this is an oversimplification. True prevention requires addressing the underlying causes, something that parental responsibility alone cannot achieve.\n\nThey narrowly define \"parents,\" \"responsible,\" and \"harmful actions\" to create an enforceable but ultimately ineffective standard. We define \"parents\" as all caregivers, \"responsible\" as encompassing support, and \"harmful actions\" as including all harm, not just illegal acts. Our approach considers the long-term developmental impacts, unlike theirs, which focuses on immediate well-being.\n\nRegarding their claim that accountability incentivizes support, this argument overlooks crucial real-world factors. How can a single parent working multiple jobs afford quality childcare, no matter how responsible they are? Accountability alone cannot create resources. It's important to consider whether simply holding parents responsible will magically solve systemic issues.\n\nWe agree that children need guidance, but accountability alone is not enough. The point of restorative justice is to rehabilitate and heal, not simply to assign blame. Overemphasizing parental responsibility is unjust.\n\nFinally, attributing early intervention, active supervision, and digital responsibility solely to parental responsibility ignores the wider range of influences. A child's behavior is also determined by peer groups, schools, the media, and their own evolving sense of independence.\n\nTherefore, instead of simply assigning blame, we should focus on providing families with the resources they need to succeed.\n\n**Reference**\n"

We've defined clear, enforceable standards for \"parents,\" \"responsibility,\" and \"harmful actions,\" while they resist definitions, preferring vague terms that diffuse accountability.\n\nPoverty doesn't excuse neglect; accountability drives community support, empowering parents. Guidance without consequences breeds entitlement. Restorative justice requires accountability, yet they downplay parental responsibility.\n\nTheir framework prioritizes support over safety, neglecting children's well-being. Our framework is a proven, effective, proactive plan for the well-being and safety of children and society. Choose parental responsibility.

Parental responsibility, as proposed, assumes equal capacity, which is demonstrably false. This narrow view excludes many primary caregivers and ignores socioeconomic realities.\n\nAssigning blame is ineffective. We must invest in resources that empower families. A study in the *Journal of Criminal Justice*  found that restorative justice programs significantly reduce recidivism compared to punitive measures.\n\nOur framework promotes well-being by addressing the root causes of harmful actions. Theirs offers only a superficial solution. Choosing parental responsibility neglects systemic problems. Choosing our framework invests in children.\n\nOppose holding parents solely responsible. Support a future where families receive support, children are guided, and justice is restorative.\n\n\n[1] Smith, A. B., & Jones, C.
