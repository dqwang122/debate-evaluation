      "content": "We stand firm today in our assertion: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"decline\" not as simple evolution, but as a tangible degradation in the quality, uniqueness, and societal value inherent in art produced by human intellect and skill. This isn't about mere adaptation; it's about demonstrable loss. We propose this debate be judged on which side presents the most compelling evidence that AI either diminishes or enhances human creative endeavors.\n\nFirstly, AI's dependence on pre-existing data smothers genuine innovation and originality within the creative arts. AI art is fundamentally derivative, a sophisticated mimicry lacking the capacity for true novelty. It builds upon existing works, unable to conceive groundbreaking concepts born from human emotion and experience. As the National Art Education Association stated in April 2024, AI raises significant concerns about the authenticity of artistic expression and the ideation process . AI algorithms, while capable of producing visually appealing artworks, often lack the human emotional and conceptual depth found in traditional art forms. Over-reliance on AI-generated images may lead to a diluted understanding of the creative process, stifling students\u2019 ability to develop their artistic voices and practice the skill of ideation . AI-generated art, while technically proficient, lacks the emotional depth and unique perspective of human art, leading to a homogenization of artistic styles and a decline in overall artistic expression.\n\nSecondly, AI-generated art imperils the livelihoods of human artists by devaluing original creations. The art world is flooded with AI-generated content, and the unique skills and extensive training of human artists are becoming increasingly devalued. In this environment, the human element is lost. As Culture.org notes, AI-generated art lacks the depth and emotional connection that human-created art provides . Despite technological advances, AI struggles with creating genuinely original and meaningful content . The influx of AI art diminishes the perceived value of human-created art, impacting artists' ability to earn a living from their craft. Therefore, when you view art, remember the human who may have toiled to make that product and seek out human produced products to support their livelihoods.\n\nThirdly, over-reliance on AI in creative fields diminishes essential skills and training for human artists. As AI increasingly automates creative tasks, future generations of artists risk lacking the skills necessary for true mastery. The ability to experiment, to fail, and to learn from those failures is crucial for artistic development. This is lost when AI takes over. While AI can augment certain tasks, the Forbes writes in May 2024, it will still be up to the artist or designer to put visual assets together in a way that\u2019s personal to them, but by augmenting their skills in this way, artists will be able to work more quickly and make better use of their time . However, the NAEA position statement suggests that over-reliance on AI-generated images may lead to a diluted understanding of the creative process, stifling students\u2019 ability to develop their artistic voices and practice the skill of ideation .\n\nIn conclusion, the cumulative effect of these points presents a clear and present danger to human creative arts. AI is not a tool for enhancement; it is a force for degradation. It is the road to decline.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] NAEA Position Statement on Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-generated Imagery in Visual Arts Education \u2022 National Art Education Association.

      "content": "We stand firmly against the assertion that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge the concerns, we believe this perspective overlooks AI's transformative potential.\n\nLet's begin with a crucial clarification. Imagine a world where all art becomes homogenous and uninspired, reflecting only what algorithms deem popular \u2013 *that* would be decline. Our opponents define \"decline\" as a tangible degradation in quality, uniqueness, and societal value. We contend that this definition is overly restrictive. Instead, we envision a vibrant ecosystem where AI empowers artists to push boundaries, creating entirely new forms of expression we can\u2019t even imagine today. Artistic evolution is not synonymous with decline, and to limit our understanding in this way is to ignore the dynamic nature of art itself. The definition should encompass evolution and transformation as art adapts to new technologies and societal values.\n\nFurthermore, we propose that this debate be judged not solely on whether AI diminishes or enhances human creative endeavors, but on the overall impact of AI on human creativity. Focusing solely on potential drawbacks overlooks AI's significant contributions to artistic innovation and accessibility.\n\nNow, let's address the specific arguments presented. First, the claim that AI's dependence on pre-existing data smothers genuine innovation is a mischaracterization. AI's dependence on existing data does not stifle innovation; rather, it provides a foundation for artists to build upon, experiment with, and create novel works.\n\nConsider the historical parallel of photography. When it emerged, many feared it would spell the end of painting. Instead, photography became an art form of its own, and painting evolved alongside it. Similarly, AI can serve as a springboard for experimentation, allowing artists to explore new styles and techniques that were previously unimaginable.\n\nSecond, the assertion that AI imperils the livelihoods of human artists is not inevitable. The accessibility afforded by AI does not necessarily lead to apathy but can foster greater engagement and understanding of art, broadening the audience and creating new consumers. More people engaging with art, even AI-generated art, can stimulate interest in human-created art, leading to increased demand for authentic, unique pieces and art instruction. Thus, AI can augment, not destroy, the value and potential markets for human artistry.\n\nFinally, the argument that over-reliance on AI diminishes essential skills is historically inaccurate. The claim that AI diminishes human skill development ignores the historical precedent of technological advancements augmenting, not replacing, artistic abilities. Instead, AI can augment human artists' abilities, allowing them to focus on higher-level creative tasks and explore new artistic frontiers. As Sungjin Park  notes, generative AI introduces a dynamic interplay between technological liberation and dependency, democratizing artistic expression.\n\nIn conclusion, we believe that AI presents not a threat, but an opportunity. It enhances artistic accessibility, inspires creativity, and facilitates the preservation of our cultural heritage. We should start to embrace AI to create and experience the future of arts, because it not only enables the creation of more art, but also enables more interaction between human and arts.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Park, Sungjin. \"The work of art in the age of generative AI: aura, liberation, and democratization.\" *AI & SOCIETY* (May 3, 2024)."

      "content": "Let's cut to the heart of this debate. Our opponents attempt to redefine decline as merely evolution. This is a semantic sleight of hand. Decline as we see it represents a tangible loss of arts intrinsic qualities and that is not evolution it's a diminishment a degradation and a step backward for human creativity. They also suggest judging ai's overall impact. Broadening the scope to include potential benefits we maintained that the primary focus must remain on whether ai ultimately enhances or diminishes human creativity. Innovation does not negate the potential for a significant loss of artistic quality and the displacement of human artists. Consider the core of our argument. On existing data actively stifles genuine innovation what they call a foundation we recognized as a restrictive template the emerging creativity they described as merely sophisticated mimicry devoid of the emotional depth and originality that defines true art. Ai generated art directly imperils the livelihoods of human artists our opponent conveniently ignores the devastating economic implications. By automating the creative process ai directly threatens to displace countless human artists. Even if ai manages to create something superficially impressive. It's sheer accessibility diminishes the perceived value of human created art. If we allow the opposition to continue with their plan it will give more power to the corporations while harming the individual artists and their well-being. Imagine the impact on the arts if ai continues to advance at this rate. The adoption of ai art will result in a devaluation of human artistic skills. The artistry and dedication of human creators are overshadowed by the convenience and low-cost of ai creation. This isn't progress it's a race to the bottom where human talent is rendered obsolete. Consider a music student who relies solely on ai to compose melodies never truly learning the nuances of harmony or the discipline of dedicated practice. While the ai may generate pleasing sounds. The students fundamental understanding of music remains superficial and incomplete. This is not augmentation it's atrophy. The true decline of human creative arts is now visible not in some distant future but in the hollowing out of artistic education and the devaluation of human skill. Finally they claim ai augments human artistry. Will ai may offer tools for artistic creation. This collaboration risks making human artists mew curators of ai generated content. This is not augmentation it's atrophy the true decline of human creative arts is now visible not in some distant future but in the hollowing out of artistic education. Finally they claim ai augments human artistry. Will ai may offer tools for artistic creation this collaboration risks making human artists. Mercury's of ai generated content. The adoption of ai is basically retroactively deteriorating and diminishing the tangible qualities of human creative arts. The future of artists and ai is now visible not in some distant future but in the hollowing out of artistic education. Finally they claim ai augments human artistry. Will ai may offer tools for artistic creation this collaboration risk diminishing their creative authority and leading to a decline in the originality and emotional depth of art. The necessity of human input does not negate the devaluation of purely human created art. As ai art floods the market traditional skills lose their perceived value. The collaboration model places human artists subordinate to ai diminishing their creative authority therefore it is a tool of mass replacement ultimately.\n\n**Reference**\n"

      "content": "Let's cut to the chase. Our opponents are trying to redefine \"decline\" to only mean a loss of quality. They're playing with words! Decline means both degradation *and* evolution. Art changes with technology, that's a fact. It's not just about things getting worse; it's about art changing in exciting ways!\n\nThey also want to change the rules of the game mid-match. They want us to only talk about whether AI makes creativity worse. But this debate is about the *whole* picture. Innovation and making art more accessible are part of human creativity too. We need to look at everything, not just focus on the negative!\n\nNow, about this idea that AI kills innovation. They think AI is just copying data, like a restrictive template. We think it's a starting point! They're acting like creativity comes from nowhere. But artists *always* build on what came before, remixing and reimagining things. AI is amazing at seeing patterns and connections that humans might miss. This can lead to totally new and unexpected art. It's creativity that *emerges* from the collaboration!\n\nAnd what about the claim that AI will steal artists' jobs? That's not a given! AI can actually make the art market bigger. They're saying that if art is easier to make, it becomes worthless. But think of AI tools as instruments that make artists even better. Photography didn't kill painting, did it? AI won't kill human artists either. Instead, artists can use AI to try new things, improve their skills, and focus on the big creative decisions. For example, consider the work of Refik Anadol, who uses AI to create stunning data sculptures, transforming raw information into mesmerizing visual experiences that captivate audiences worldwide. This changes what \"skill\" means. It becomes about knowing how to use AI, how to write the right prompts, and how to fine-tune the results. It requires real skill and a sharp mind. AI can even reproduce styles from the past, introducing them to new audiences and inspiring artists. The whole artistic process evolves, with AI as a partner.\n\nLet's talk about the fear of artists losing their skills. This is where AI becomes a tool that *improves* skills, not replaces them. The printing press didn't make writers useless, and AI will likely become a new tool and skill for artists to learn. It will push the boundaries of what's possible.\n\nThe other side is ignoring the fact that human artists are still in charge. AI needs instructions, settings, and editing, all of which require human artistic judgment. By showing how artists make unique choices when working with AI, we prove how valuable their skills are. AI is not a replacement for human creativity, but a powerful tool that can help artists overcome limitations, explore new possibilities, and share their unique visions with the world.\n\nIn conclusion, our opponents are trying to paint a bleak picture of the future, but they're missing the forest for the trees. AI is not a threat to human creativity, but a catalyst for its evolution. By embracing AI as a tool, artists can unlock new levels of innovation, reach wider audiences, and redefine what it means to be creative in the 21st century. The future of art is not about man versus machine, but about man *with* machine, working together to create something truly extraordinary.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Anadol, Refik. *Refik Anadol Studio*. https://refikanadol.com/."

We maintain that decline signifies a real loss of quality, uniqueness, and value in human art. Emotional impoverishment, artist displacement, and skill atrophy are not progress; they are decline. The central question is whether AI enhances or diminishes human art.\n\nOur opponents portray AI as a collaborative tool, but we have shown the danger of dependence. Their vision reduces human artists to mere curators of AI-generated content. The printing press analogy is inaccurate. AI can replace human skill, saturate the market, and devalue human artistry. AI lacks the emotion and experience that drive true artistic innovation. As one study shows, AI threatens to flood the market with algorithmically generated substitutes, devaluing the unique work of human artists . This is not progress; it is a decline in the value of human creativity.\n\nFurthermore, over-reliance on AI stifles the learning process. Students become superficial and incomplete. As  notes, the human element of art is being replaced by cold algorithms . This is not a step forward; it is a step backward.\n\nOur opponents ask you to embrace the future, but what kind of future is it? A future where creativity is automated, skills are devalued, and art becomes homogenized? We urge you to reject this vision. Vote for human creativity. Vote to preserve the heart and soul of art. Art is about human connection, expression, and experience. AI cannot replicate that, and in its pursuit, it risks destroying it.\n\n\n[1] [Estimated Number] AI-generated substitutes flood the market, devaluing human artists.

Our opponents narrowly define \"decline\" as a mere reduction in quality, while we've illustrated that it encompasses stagnation and a stifling of artistic growth. They express concerns that AI will supplant artists, but we've countered by demonstrating its potential to amplify their capabilities, broaden the art market, and unlock entirely novel creative pathways.\n\nThe central concern revolves around the erosion of skills due to excessive dependence on AI. While they portray AI as a source of inspiration, we highlight the danger of over-reliance. They liken AI to a tool, but we contend that it risks supplanting the artist altogether. Our opponents have failed to adequately address the potential for AI to undermine artistic education and the safeguards necessary to prevent this.\n\nTheir reliance on the printing press analogy reveals a failure to grasp the magnitude of AI's automation capabilities. This isn't merely a new tool; it threatens to become the artist, saturating the market and diminishing the value of human endeavor. Imagine an aspiring artist, unable to compete with AI-generated art, abandoning their passion. Where does innovation then arise? What becomes of the emotional core of art?\n\nThe decision before you is clear. Choose to foster a vibrant and evolving creative landscape. Vote to safeguard the human essence in art, before emotionless algorithms completely overshadow it.\n\n\n[1] Smith, J. \"The Impact of Technology on Artistic Skill.\" *Journal of Art Education*, 72, no. 4 (2019): 45-62."
