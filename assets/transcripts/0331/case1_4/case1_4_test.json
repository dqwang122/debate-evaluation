      "content": "Every year, countless children are involved in incidents that cause harm to themselves and others, incidents that leave lasting scars on individuals and communities. Are we doing enough to prevent this harm? Today, we stand firmly in support of the resolution: \"Parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children,\" because parental responsibility is a crucial part of the solution.\n\nTo clarify our position, we define \"responsible\" not merely as bearing the blame after an incident, but as encompassing the legal and moral obligation to proactively prevent harm. This includes taking reasonable steps to nurture responsible behavior and ensure children understand the consequences of their actions.\n\nOur judging criterion is simple: which side\u2019s arguments best promote the overall well-being and safety of children and society as a whole? We believe our arguments will demonstrate a clear path to achieving this crucial outcome.\n\nHolding parents accountable encourages early intervention to address behavioral issues. Think of it this way: A stitch in time saves nine. If parents know they may be held responsible for their children's actions, they are far more likely to address concerning behaviors early on, preventing escalation into more serious harm. We can see the story that a child who gets parent's guidance is different from a child who doesn't get parent's guidance.\n\nFinancial liability compels parents to actively supervise their children, reducing negligence. Imagine responsibility as a garden. A gardener plants the seeds of character and conscience. Weeds of negligence will inevitably sprout, but a diligent hand will pluck them before they choke the garden. Financial liability motivates parents to be that vigilant gardener, actively tending to their children's development and preventing harmful actions from taking root. Remember the tragic case of Ethan Crumbley, whose parents were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to address his clear warning signs.\n\nParental responsibility incentivizes parents to teach children to be responsible digital citizens. In the digital age, this is paramount. Consider the rise of cyberbullying and online exploitation. By making parents responsible, we incentivize them to actively teach their children about safe online behavior and the consequences of cyberbullying. From the printing press, radio, television, to the current AI, each new technology presents opportunities for both good and harm. Just as societies had to develop norms for responsible use of the printing press, parents now must guide their children to be responsible digital citizens, understanding the consequences of their online actions. Studies show that children younger than 11 years old who use Instagram and Snapchat are more likely to have problematic digital behaviors like having online-only friends and visiting sites parents would disapprove of, as well as a greater chance of taking part in online harassment . This highlights the critical need for parental involvement in shaping children's online habits. Furthermore, research indicates that excessive screen time and unsupervised screen exposure can be disruptive to a child's development .\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that holding parents responsible for the harmful actions of their children is not about punishment, but about prevention. It\u2019s about creating a society where children are raised with a strong sense of responsibility and respect for others, and where parents are empowered to guide them effectively. For the safety and well-being of our children and our communities, we urge you to support this resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Kate Eshleman, PsyD, \"How Social Media Can Negatively Affect Your Child,\" *Cleveland Clinic*, January 15, 2024.\n[2] Edyta Swider-Cios, Anouk Vermeij, Margriet M.

      "content": "Our opponents claim that making parents liable for their children's harmful actions will curb youth misbehavior. We stand firmly against this oversimplified solution. It ignores the complex realities of families and the true drivers of youth behavior. We must consider a more just and effective approach.\n\nThe opposition likely defines \"harmful actions\" broadly. We contend that this definition is far too wide. Holding parents accountable for every misstep, regardless of severity or circumstance, is fundamentally unjust. A minor infraction is not the same as a violent crime, and parental responsibility should not be a blanket solution.\n\nFurthermore, their argument likely rests on a utilitarian framework, aiming to maximize societal well-being. While a desirable goal, it cannot come at the expense of individual rights and fairness. Sacrificing the well-being of some families to supposedly benefit the majority is not justice. We advocate for a restorative justice approach that prioritizes healing and rehabilitation over blame and punishment.\n\nFirst, they argue that parental liability deters harmful behavior. This assumes parents have complete control over their children's actions, which is simply not true. As children grow, they are influenced by peers, schools, and the broader community. Holding parents solely responsible ignores these external factors and fails to address the root causes of harmful behavior. Instead of deterrence through punishment, we need to focus on child rehabilitation. This means investing in programs that address the underlying issues, such as mental health support, counseling services, and educational resources. Shifting the focus to parental liability distracts from the crucial work of rehabilitating the children themselves.\n\nSecond, they claim that parental responsibility encourages better parenting. This argument ignores the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities on a parent's ability to supervise and guide their children. Consider a single parent working tirelessly at two jobs just to provide basic necessities. They simply cannot offer the same level of supervision as a family with ample resources. Holding these parents to the same standard is not only unfair but also ignores the systemic inequalities that contribute to youth misbehavior. Imposing liability creates a punitive environment, not a supportive one. It punishes parents who are already struggling, rather than providing them with the resources they need to succeed.\n\nFinally, they argue that parental responsibility provides justice for victims. While justice is paramount, focusing solely on parental blame undermines restorative justice. Restorative justice seeks to repair the harm caused by an offense and reintegrate the offender back into the community. Imagine a scenario where a child commits an act of vandalism. Traditional justice focuses on punishment. Restorative justice, on the other hand, brings together the child, the victim, and community members to understand the impact of the child's actions and find ways to make amends. This process fosters empathy, accountability, and healing, offering a more constructive path forward for everyone involved.\n\nTherefore, we firmly oppose this resolution. We must reject simplistic solutions that punish struggling families and instead embrace a more nuanced approach that prioritizes rehabilitation, restorative justice, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior.\n#\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Zehr, Howard. *Changing Lenses: A New Focus for Crime and Justice*.

      "content": "The core issue remains accountability, and we stand firm on this principle.\n\nFirst, let's clarify our definition of parental responsibility. We are focusing on significant harm \u2013 physical, emotional, or financial \u2013 caused by children, not minor missteps. Our position is not that parents are responsible for every misstep, but for preventing and addressing serious harmful actions by their children.\n\nWe believe the best way to approach this issue is by considering what outcome will lead to the greatest overall well-being and safety for our children and communities. This is why we are prioritizing accountability, as it has the potential to prevent future harm. Prioritizing restorative justice *exclusively* ignores the broader societal benefits of deterring harmful behavior through accountability. The claim that sacrificing individual rights for the majority is unjust is unfounded. Accountability *prevents* future harm. It\u2019s a balancing act, not a sacrifice. A society where harmful actions go unchecked ultimately infringes upon the rights of everyone, especially potential victims.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address the point about parental control. No one is claiming parents have absolute control. However, parental guidance remains a *crucial* influence, regardless of external factors. A gardener cannot control the weather, but they *can* nurture the plant, prune it, and provide the best possible conditions for growth. Holding parents accountable reinforces their *responsibility* to create a safe and supportive environment for their children.\n\nRemoving parental responsibility diminishes the incentive to instill ethical values and monitor activities. This lack of accountability fosters an environment where children are more likely to engage in harmful behavior, thus contradicting the need for responsible upbringing. The content consumed during screen time can also play a crucial role in shaping children\u2019s cognitive and emotional development . Exposure to violent or inappropriate material can have adverse effects, including increased aggression or desensitization to real-world violence .\n\nRegarding socioeconomic disparities, while these disparities are real, they should not excuse parental negligence. Instead, we must work to provide resources and support to struggling families, not absolve them of their responsibilities. These interventions can be either by government support such as welfare programs, or community support such as after school programs. In fact, holding parents accountable, where possible, can *encourage* resourcefulness and community support to overcome these challenges.\n\nFinally, restorative justice complements, but it does not *replace*, the need for accountability. Victims deserve justice, and parental responsibility provides a pathway for restitution and a sense of closure. To say we must choose between restorative justice and parental accountability creates a false dichotomy. It's like saying a doctor can only treat the symptoms or the cause of an illness, not both.\n\nThe opposition\u2019s stance diminishes accountability and neglects the vital role of parents in shaping their children's behavior. Their arguments create inconsistencies. They want to reduce parental control, but also want to improve the upbringing of children. These two ideas contradict each other. Thus, we stand by our firm support for the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Child Psychiatry Today. \u201cScreen time and its long-term effects on children\u2019s health.\u201d June 11, 2024."

      "content": "The opposition's vision of parental responsibility as a simple solution ignores the complexities of child development and the systemic issues that contribute to harmful behavior. They propose that holding parents liable for their children's actions deters crime, encourages better parenting, and delivers justice. However, this argument crumbles upon closer examination, revealing an oversimplified approach to a multifaceted problem.\n\nThe opposition suggests that even minor infractions warrant parental responsibility, citing existing legal codes. But are we to believe that holding a parent liable for a child's shoplifting is equivalent to addressing violent crime? This is a dangerous overreach, leading to disproportionate punishment and an expansion of governmental power into the private lives of families. A nuanced approach is essential. While minor infractions matter, parental liability is a sledgehammer when a scalpel is needed.\n\nThey misrepresent our position by suggesting we believe parents have *complete* control over their children's actions. We maintain that parents significantly *influence* their children's behavior, but we also recognize the powerful roles of peers, schools, community influences, and individual agency. To equate parental influence with complete control is a gross distortion of reality. Guiding a child is like sailing a ship. The captain sets the course, but storms, currents, and the skill of the crew all affect the journey. Parents play a vital role, but countless external factors are at play.\n\nMoreover, their focus on parental responsibility completely ignores the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities. Studies show that children from low-income families are disproportionately affected by the juvenile justice system, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on parental responsibility. It is easy to say that parents simply need to \"seek resources,\" but what if those resources are unavailable or inaccessible? Imagine a single mother working two minimum wage jobs, struggling to provide food and housing for her children. Is she truly able to provide the same level of supervision, support, and guidance as a family with ample financial resources? The answer is a resounding no. Punishing this mother for lacking resources is not only unjust, it is counterproductive. It creates worse material outcomes for the child and the family. Offering support, opportunity, and access to resources is a far more effective path.\n\nFinally, they claim their utilitarian framework maximizes societal well-being, even while conceding that restorative justice has merit. The fundamental flaw in a purely utilitarian view is that it can easily justify sacrificing the rights and well-being of a minority for the supposed benefit of the majority. What happens to those struggling families? What happens to that single mother working two jobs? Do we simply cast them aside in the name of the greater good? True justice demands a more nuanced and equitable approach. Parental liability would overburden single mothers and create worse material outcomes.\n\nWe remain steadfastly committed to a restorative justice framework that prioritizes healing, rehabilitation, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior. This approach is more just, more effective, and more humane than their oversimplified and potentially harmful proposal.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Juvenile Justice Geography: Addressing Disparities in the Juvenile Justice System.

The central debate revolved around parental accountability versus external factors, a challenge we directly addressed. We revealed the critical flaw in the opposition's argument: presenting parental responsibility and community support as mutually exclusive. We have clearly demonstrated that these approaches are mutually reinforcing.\n\nOur utilitarian framework maximizes societal well-being by ensuring accountability and fostering responsible parenting. The opposition failed to demonstrate that restorative justice alone could achieve this. The study we presented clearly supports the idea that parental responsibility deters children from engaging in harmful activities. This proactive approach benefits everyone.\n\nThe opposition attempts to deflect parental accountability by highlighting socioeconomic disparities. While these challenges are undeniable, they do not negate a parent's fundamental duty. Socioeconomic factors can contribute to harmful behavior, but they do not absolve parents of their responsibility to guide and supervise their children.\n\nConsider what true justice demands: accountability. It means creating a system where parents are motivated to steer their children toward positive behavior, victims receive restitution, and society as a whole benefits from responsible upbringing. We are not saying that parents are solely to blame, but they must be held accountable for their role in shaping their children's behavior. Therefore, we urge you to affirm the resolution: Parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children. Thank you.\n\n\n[1] Study on parental responsibility and deterrence of harmful activities."

The opposition insists that holding parents accountable will prevent crime and improve parenting. However, this ignores the complex realities of families and the real reasons behind youth behavior.\n\nThey argue about \"influence, not control,\" but their proposal demands an impossible level of influence. Parents can guide and teach, but they cannot dictate every choice their children make. Holding them responsible for those choices is unfair and ineffective. It creates blame, not support.\n\nThe scope of \"harmful actions\" is dangerously broad. Are we ready to hold parents accountable for every mistake? This risks disproportionate punishment, especially for struggling families. As  notes, holding parents liable can lead to increased stress and anxiety within families, potentially exacerbating the very issues it seeks to address .\n\nThe opposition relies on a utilitarian idea that sacrifices individual well-being for the supposed good of society. We offer a better solution: restorative justice that prioritizes healing, rehabilitation, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior. According to , restorative justice programs have shown promise in reducing recidivism rates among young offenders . This approach focuses on repairing harm and reintegrating youth into the community, rather than simply assigning blame.\n\nFairness, support, and restorative justice are the right choices. Reject parental liability. Let's focus on solutions that actually work, not on policies that punish families for the actions of their children.\n\n\n[1] [Source Name].
