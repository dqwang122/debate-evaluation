But unfortunately I can not do that [1]. I would suggest that we should subsidize space exploration [2]. Let me start with a few words of background. Space exploration is the ongoing discovery and exploration of celestial structures in outer space by means of continuously evolving and growing space technology [24]. Our main issue today is presumably economic. But the economy is not just about finance and numbers. There are other, more important considerations [9]. Subsidizing space exploration [2] is making good use of government money, because it carries benefits for society as a whole. It is our duty to support it. The World Trade Organization's \"Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures\" recognizes the indispensability of a subsidy for a government [10]. There are two [2] issues I will elaborate on now. I will demonstrate how space exploration can help advance technology [4]. In addition I will talk about business [5]. And I will end by discussing some other issues that show the positive aspects of space exploration [2]. Let's talk about technology [5]. Space exploration generates invaluable technology on all fronts [6]. It [2] can help advance technology and enrich the human mind [6]. It [2] is important beyond the scientific gains because it inspires and stimulates young men and women to think beyond themselves [6]. It [2] inspires our children to pursue education and careers in science, technology, engineering and mathematics [6]. It [2] is more important than good roads or improved schools or better health care [6]. I also mentioned business [5]. Space exploration is an ideal venue for such partnerships and such enterprises [6]. It [2] is a very sound investment [6]. Company has supported space exploration and helped enable life in space for more than 50 years [7]. Focusing on Germany [2], speaking at 's event, german minister for economic affairs Brigitte Zypries said that space exploration plays a significant role in the german economy, employing around 8,500 people and generating revenues of 2.5 billion euros [7]. Finally, one last issue, related to the natural environment [2]. Space exploration is for the benefit of all humans [6]. It [2] is a natural avenue to explore that has endless rewards to people on Earth [6]. It [2] has generated major spinoffs for our life right on Earth [6]. It [2] is vital to our survival as a species [6]. It [2] represents the ultimate challenge in our quest to explore new frontiers and expand our collective sense of humanity's place in the universe [6]. It [2] is quite important for developing human knowledge and especially of the things outside the planet [6]. It [2] has yielded enormous practical benefits for Americans [6]. Astronomy and space exploration are the epitome of achievement and the human condition [6]. The innovations and breakthroughs provided by space exploration can help promote understanding of climate variability, water, energy and carbon cycles, and ecosystems, among other issues [6]. Commercial space exploration and space tourism are the way of the future [6]. SCOTT PELLEY (voiceover): in 2010, SpaceX : Elon Muskis the founder and CEO truly believes that low-cost space exploration is essential to the survival of mankind [7]. In light of all I presented, I believe that we should subsidize space exploration [2]. You might hear my opponent talk today about different priorities in subsidies. she might say that subsidies are needed, but not for space exploration [2]. If she can present the data about what better fits subsidy, I would love to see it [15]. Thank you for listening. "

		"content": "Alright, thank you very much. So I agree completely with Project Debater. This debate is not about if there are things in space to discover. This debate is not about if a government subsidy could provide the funds which would advance this field. This debate is about if this is an appropriate allocation of government funds and what I’m going to show you in my speech is explain when the government should subsidize something and why space exploration simply doesn't meet the criteria. Before that, three points of rebuttal. So firstly and I must object to this my human side about space exploration being the epitome of human achievement. I think this is doing a great disservice to things like Shakespearean plays, to the great arts that we've had and to other realms in which humans can advance moreover, other realms in which humans have advanced without the funding from the government. Secondly, this idea of space exploration being a vehicle for the development of technology, right? It's unquestionable that technology does develop but the question is what are the practical applications of this exact type of technology? And the truth is that we think that there are better earthly applications to different realms of scientific explorations. It's great that space exploration develops minds and inspires them to go study science and tech but we think that a better inspiration for science and tech careers are people who are inspired to become scientists who research the cure for cancer, people who are inspired to become scientists which study environmental rights and can help better impact our planet and prevent detrimental effects of global warming that are currently threatening humans who live on earth today, right? So we're all for tech and science careers. We just think other practical applications are a better use of those funds and then thirdly this idea space exploration being necessary for the human survival as a species and we think it seems a little bit far-fetched, right? We think that global warming and things like that are currently processes which can be reversible, right? There are things that we can and probably really should be doing to slow the effect of global warming and to make sure that earth is a habitable place before we start giving up on the planet investing all of our funds in space exploration. So we disagree that those are good enough reasons to be exploring space but let's talk about when the government does subsidize something because the rationale says that government funds are both taken from people's hard-earned money through taxes, right? And they're also limited. We cannot subsidize everything. We must make a smart decision about how we allocate government money and what we believe in opposition is that needs to meet two important criteria. Firstly, that the thing that we subsidize is a basic human right, right? We'll subsidize food. We'll subsidize education because we believe as a society we choose as a society to be one which cares for our weakest members. We want people to have the basic needs that they need to rise up the social ladder. This is why we subsidize basic needs. Second thing we subsidize are products that could not exist otherwise, right? We think clothes, for example, are an important human need but we think that the market does a good enough job of creating cheap and accessible clothing for everyone. So we don't see a reason for the government to spend their money there. Let's talk about why this space exploration simply doesn't meet those criteria, right? We think that space exploration is simply not a human right. A, we think lots of money can be poured into it to have no results at all, right? We've seen how many exploratory trips to mars which get lost or malfunction and don't end up working, right? We're pouring good money after that but even if these space exploration technologies are successful, we think they have no clear value of satisfying curiosity to something being a basic human right, right? It's not a part of any UN declaration that I’ve heard of or anything about the satisfaction of curiosity satisfies any basic human rights and then even if you are you think that the satisfaction of curiosity is a basic human right, we think that definitely there are rights that are more important, right? If we look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs what we see is that we need to first fulfill other criteria, other terrible problems that are happening across the globe before we go in and start funding the space exploration. So for now, please think that you should oppose. "

		"stage": "rebuttal",
		"side": "for",
		"content": "Thank you. Allow me to respond to some of my opponent's most recent claims. I think that one of the claims made by Ms. Ovadya [2] was that people should choose how to spend their money [20]. I would like to offer a different view. People should spend their hard earned money as they please. But society has a duty to provide help to its people in need, like the hard workers with low wages. As most people would not choose to support them, subsidies are necessary [17]. Another point that I believe my opponent made was that there are more important things than space exploration to spend money on [20]. It is very easy to say that there are more important things to spend money on, and I do not dispute this - no one is claiming that this is the only item on our expense list. But that is beside the point. As subsidizing space exploration [2] would clearly benefit society, I maintain that this is something the government should pursue [17]. Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed said that space exploration is an investment in the minds of Emiratis, arab human resources and specialised science that will take the UAE to new successes [7]. I would like to talk about how space exploration would help the economy [4]. I will then mention other issues which emphasize the positive aspects of space exploration [2]. Exploring the issue of the economy [5], it's almost as simple as arithmetic: subsidizing space exploration usually returns the investment and for that it is justified [2]. Space exploration would help the economy and national security [6]. It [2] is key to a vibrant economy [6]. It [2] will bring significant economic development, creating more jobs in an exploding industry that will include tourism, mining and colonization [6]. It [2] is a long term driver for innovation and strengthening international cooperation on an all-inclusive basis and creating new opportunities for addressing global challenges [6]. The exploration of space brings economic and cultural benefits to the nation [6]. Innovation and knowledge derived from space exploration directly contribute to economic growth and societal well-being [6]. Such an approach to the continued exploration of space is a strong one for our country and our economy [6]. American leadership in space exploration is a key driver of american leadership in a host of high-tech and emerging industries [6]. Space exploration in all its forms has unforeseen spin-offs that provide widereaching benefits through new technologies and new approaches to a range of challenges [6]. Take an example from Dubai [2]. Dubai declaration asserts that space exploration is a long-term driver for innovation and for strengthening international co-operation [7]. Regarding a different issue, peaceful nuclear-powered space exploration is designed to reassure people about future nuclear weapons in orbit [6]. Space exploration does help in making a nation technologically advanced [6]. It [2] has great benefits for the United States and the world [6]. Having a space exploration program is a critical part of being a great power [6]. Investing in space exploration will bring positive returns for the country [6]. If I may put it a bit differently. Subsidizing space exploration is like investing in really good tires. It may not be fun to spend the extra money, but ultimately you know both you and everyone else on the road will be better off [14]. For all of these reasons, I think the motion should stand. We should subsidize space exploration [2]. That concludes my speech. Thanks for listening. "

		"content": "Thank you very much. So I think that if you want to invest in tires, you should invest in tires. I think that there is income inequality happening in the United States. There is education inequality. There is a planet which is slowly becoming uninhabitable if you look at the Flint water crisis. If you look at droughts that happen in California all the time and if you want to help, these are real problems that exist that we need to help people who are currently not having all of their basic human rights fulfilled. These are things that the government should be investing money in and should probably be investing more money in because we see them being problems in our society that are hurting people. What I’m going to do in this speech is I’m going to continue talking about these criteria, continue talking about why we're not meeting basic needs and why also the market itself is probably solving this problem already. Before that, two points of rebuttal to what we just heard from Project Debater. So firstly, we heard that this is technology that would end up benefiting society but we're not sure we haven't yet heard evidence that shows us why it would benefit all of society, perhaps some parts of society, maybe upper middle class or upper class citizens could benefit from these inspiring research, could benefit from the technological innovations. But most of society, people who are currently in the United States have resource scarcity, people who are hungry, people who do not have access to good education, aren't really helped by this. So we think it is like that, a government subsidy should go to something that helps everyone particularly weaker classes in society. Second point is this idea of an exploding industry which creates jobs and international cooperation. So firstly, we've heard evidence that this already exists, right? We've heard evidence that companies are investing in this as is. And secondly, we think that international cooperation or the specific things have alternatives. We can cooperate over other types of economic trade deals. We can cooperate in other ways with different countries. It's not necessary to very specifically fund space exploration to get these benefits. So as we remember, there are two criteria that I believe the government needs to meet before subsidizing something. It being a basic human need, we don't see space exploration meeting that and B, that this is something that can't otherwise exist, right? So we've already heard from Project Debater how huge this industry is, right? How much investment there's already going on in the private sector and we think this is because there's lots of curiosity especially among wealthy people who maybe want to get to space for personal use or who want to build a colony on Mars and then rent out the rooms there. We know that Elon Musk is doing this already. We know that other people are doing it and we think they're spending money and willing to spend even more money because of the competition between them. So Project Debater should know better than all of us how competitions often bear extremely impressive fruit, right? We think that when wealthy philanthropist or people who are willing to fund research on their own race each other to be the first to achieve new heights in terms of space exploration, that brings us to great achievements already and we think that the private market is doing this well enough already. Considering that we already have movement in that direction, again we see Elon Musk's company, we see all of these companies working already. We think that it's not that the government money won't help out if it were to be given, we just think it doesn't meet the criteria in comparison to other things, right? So given the fact that the market already has a lot of money invested in this, already has movement in those research directions, and given the fact that we still don't think this is a good enough plan to prioritize over other basic needs that the government should be providing people. We think that at the end of the day, given the fact that there are also alternatives to getting all of these benefits of international cooperation, it simply doesn't justify specifically the government allocating its funds for this purpose when it should be allocating them towards other needs of other people."

		"content": "Project Debater – Summary Speech Thanks for returning to me one last time, moderator. To close the debate, I will reiterate my main points. Among other things, I think Noaa Ovadya [2] suggested that space exploration takes resources away from more worthy causes [22]. I have a different viewpoint. Space exploration gives back more than it takes from the treasury. Dr. Joan Vernikos, a former head of NASA Life Sciences, argues 'economic, scientific and technological returns of space exploration have far exceeded the investmentroyalties on NASA patents and licenses currently go directly to the U.S. Treasury, not back to NASA.' [25]. Another point that I believe Ms. Ovadya [2] made was that the government warps the market with its subsidies [20]. There are certain considerations that the profit-driven market does not take into account, as a result of failures and distortions within the market mechanism. Government subsidies are essential for balancing the economy and improving the way resources are allocated [17]. One of the main clash points in this debate was the economy [5]. As you may have noticed, my opponent believes that space exploration is too expensive. I, on the other hand, think otherwise [2]. For example, I suggested that space exploration would help the economy [4]. This is a major clash, because a better economy improves the lives of everyone. I believe that the evidence is on my side here. Evaluating complicated questions, as the one before us, should take into consideration which views are better backed by research data. I believe I win on this today [2]. I will repeat my main arguments. One claim I made was that space exploration can help advance technology [4]. Another point I made was the following: space exploration is an ideal venue for such partnerships and such enterprises [4]. And a final point to consider is that space exploration is for the benefit of all humans [4]. I find it fitting to finish with this quote, from Political philosophers Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri: if by free market one means a market that is autonomous and spontaneous, free from political controls, then there is no such thing as a free market at all. It is simply a myth [13]. We should subsidize space exploration [2]. I thank you for your time. "

		"content": "Alright, so thank you very much Project Debater. It's been a big pleasure for me. But in my summary speech I’m going to go over what I’ve told you on the opposition side of the house which is the following: when I’ve mentioned Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, the logic says that we need to fulfill basic needs before we can fulfill higher needs of humans, right? First, I need to meet basic needs of food and shelter in order to then, be able to have my social needs met in order to then, reach self-actualization, right? I cannot selfactualize if I’m hungry, if I’m looking for my next meal and so on. We're telling you is that when the government chooses where to allocate money it should first solve these very basic problems to allow the best access to everyone in society to then be able to move up the social ladder to selfactualize and we think that at the end of the day, we don't understand why so much government money and we're talking about millions if not billions of dollars which are going to research that doesn't always even bear fruit, that could be going to schools, that could be going to food. But then Project Debater tells us that while I’m talking about basic needs and she thinks they're already met, on her side of the house she's telling you that we can get patents, that we can make scientific approaches and that's a unique benefit of space exploration. But what I’ve also told you is that we can have all of these advancements just in the field of medical patents for example, of environmental science, or of computer science which can solve problems of education, decision making like we're doing here today etc. So regardless of if you're looking to solve very basic human needs or even if we're looking at where we should be investing government money in science and tech, we think there are more valuable needs that should be met and that should be funded. We don't understand why we need to specifically fund space. So at the end of the day, the opposition line here in this debate says that there are two criteria for subsidizing something for government money. Its meeting basic human needs and it is something that cannot otherwise develop in the market. Given that the market does take care of this, Elon Musk and all of his friends are currently funding this. Project Debater has shown you all of the countries in which this is already of a worthwhile and lucrative industry. Given the fact that we should definitely be spending government money on other things, we beg you to oppose this motion."
