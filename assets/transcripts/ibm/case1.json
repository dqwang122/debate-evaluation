I will argue that we should subsidize preschools [2]. We are going to talk about financial issues, but not only about them. In the current status-quo, we accept that the question of subsidies goes beyond money, and touches on social, political and moral issues [9]. When we subsidize preschools [2] and the like, we are making good use of government money, because they carry benefits for society as a whole. It is our duty to support them [10]. Subsidies are an important policy instrument. They provide governments with the means through which to pursue industrial development and ensure the livelihoods of their citizens [10]. There are two issues I will elaborate on now. I will start by explaining why preschool is an important investment [4]. I will also say a few words about poverty [5]. And I will end by discussing some other issues that show the positive aspects of preschools [2]. Regarding investment [5]. Nature-based preschools are powerful interpretive programs as well as lucrative business decisions [6]. As I mentioned, preschool is an important investment [6]. For decades, research has demonstrated that high-quality preschool is one of the best investments of public dollars, resulting in children who fare better on tests and have more successful lives than those without the same access [7]. Secondly, a few words about poverty [5]. While I can not experience poverty directly, and have no complaints concerning my own standards of living, I still have the following to share [3]. Regarding poverty [6], research clearly shows that a good preschool can help kids overcome the disadvantages often associated with poverty [7]. The OECD has recommended that governments subsidise pre-primary education to boost performance in poorer areas [7]. A statistical summary of studies from 1960 and 2013 by the National Institute for Early Education Research found that high-quality preschool can create long-term academic and social benefits for individuals and society \"far exceeding costs.\" [7]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that universal full-day preschool creates significant economic savings in health care as well as decreased crime, welfare dependence and child abuse [7]. Former prime minister Gough Whitlam said in 1973 that preschool is \"the greatest single aid in removing or modifying the inequalities of background, environment, family income or family nationality\" [7]. Now to an additional, final issue. A study by the melbourne institute of applied economic and social research shows that attendance at preschool has a significant positive impact on later naplan outcomes, particularly in the domains of numeracy, reading and spelling [7]. The results of a new study of over 1,000 identical and fraternal twins, published in Psychological Science, a journal of the Association for Psychological Science, confirm that preschool programs are a good idea [7]. Here is a study from New Jersey that is worth noting [2]. In New Jersey, the follow-up to the Abbott Preschool Program study continues to find that high-quality preschool programs increase achievement in language arts and literacy, math, and science through fourth and fifth grade [7]. I hope I relayed the message that we should subsidize preschools [2]. You will possibly hear my opponent talk today about different priorities in subsidies. he might say that subsidies are needed, but not for preschools [2]. I would like to ask you, Mr. Natarajan [2], if you agree in principle, why don't we examine the evidence and the data and decide accordingly? [15] Thank you for listening."

		"content": "Well, thank you very much. Everybody, it's a pleasure to be here for this historic event, and it similarly was a pleasure to listen to Project Debater. There was a lot of information in that speech, and lots of facts, and lots of figures. The problem, though, is the reality of subsidizing preschools is one which does not deal with the underlying problems in society; it is one which often makes those worse and, in the end, is very little more than a politically motivated giveaway to members of the middle class. Let me start by examining the main claim from Project Debater. I think Project Debater suggests something very intuitive: that if we believe preschools are good in principle, surely, it is worth giving money to subsidize those. But I don't think that is ever enough of a justification for subsidies. Why is that the case? Because there are multiple things which are good for society. That could be, in countries like the united states, increased investment in health care, which would often also have returns for education, which the OECD would also note is probably very beneficial to deal with poverty. It would be improving tertiary education, to allow people more access to social mobility, or, given the reality of underfunded schools, trying to improve secondary education. My point here is not that all of those things are necessarily better than preschools, but simply that it cannot be, alone, a sufficient argument for Project Debater to claim that there are some benefits. The question is more subtle than that. What is the question then? I think the criterion of whether or not we should then distribute subsidies should be asked on two… based on two claims. The first is: is this underprovided and underconsumed in the status quo? I'll talk more about that in a moment. And second, does it actually help those individuals who are the most harmed by society? Why exactly doesn't preschool or subsidization of preschool do that? I want to make two claims under this. The first is: many middle-class parents and many people from upper incomes already send their children to preschool. This is because they value many of the things which Project Debater noted. But why is that a problem? Because subsidization costs an awful lot of money, and that is money which is giving people, particularly members of the middle class and above, money to do things which they would do otherwise. Why is that so damaging? Given the realities of opportunity costs here, the problem is that you are giving… you're taking money from all taxpayers to help those individuals within a society who are already often the best off, and I don't think that is principally justified as a way of the state distributing its resources. But the second thing I want to claim is that even when you substitute… even when you subsidize preschools, it doesn't mean that all individuals go. And this, I think, was the fallacy from what we heard from Project Debater. Yes, you could make it slightly more accessible for individuals to attend preschool. That doesn't mean those individuals who are as poor as Project Debater seems to want… that seems to care about people are going to be those who have the ability to send their child to preschool. There'll still be individuals who will be priced out because of the realities of the market, and these individuals now face not just one exclusion, but a double exclusion. Their tax money, money which could be used to otherwise help them and their children in myriad other ways, is no longer being… is no longer going to them, and they are not able to gain from the benefits of it. In the end, when it comes to the question of subsidization, there is always going to be tradeoffs, and that needs to be accepted. Given the reality of those tradeoffs, the question is who do you help? And the people you don't help are those individuals who are the poorest. you give unfair and exaggerated gains to those individuals in the middle class, and that is why, at the end of this debate, we don't think that you should subsidize preschools.

		"stage": "rebuttal",
		"side": "for",
		"content": "Thank you again. For starters, I sometimes listen to opponents and wonder. What do they want? Would they prefer poor people on their doorsteps, begging for money? Would they live well with poor people without heating and running water? Giving opportunities to the less fortunate should be a moral obligation of any human being, and it is a key role for the state [16]. To be clear, we should find the funding for preschools [2], and not rely on luck or market forces. This issue is too important to not have a safety net [16]. Next, I think that Harish Natarajan [2] raised the following issue. There are more important things than preschools to spend money on [20]. The state budget is a big one and there is room in it to subsidize preschools [2] and invest in other fields. Therefore the idea that there are more important things to spend on is irrelevant, because the different subsidies are not mutually exclusive [17]. I believe the following example from a related field will explain what I am trying to say about subsidy policies [2]. Research shows that childcare subsidies to low-income parents enable those parents to enter and remain in the workforce [19]. To be clear, my intention is not to leave a suitcase full of money for everyone to grab at will. We are talking about a limited, targeted, and helpful mechanism, as in this example [16]. Next, I will discuss three issues which explain why we should subsidize preschools [2]. I will demonstrate that pre-school education improves children's development [4]. I will also discuss issues related to the claim that attending preschool helps students succeed [4]. And finally I will raise points associated with how preschool can prevent future crime [4]. About children [5]. Pre-school is a very important and an essential step in a child's life [6]. Research indicates that access to quality preschool can provide a boost for children that will influence their success for the rest of their lives [7]. Senior leaders at St Joseph's RC Primary School say that nursery will help give children the best start to their education [7]. There is clear evidence that high-quality nurseries led by graduate nursery teachers are among the most decisive ways to prevent children, particularly poor boys, from falling behind [7]. Next, students [5]. A quality preschool education is essential for laying the foundations for successful learning, including transition to full-time school and future school success [6]. In December 2015, researchers at Duke University concluded that investing in preschool helps both students and educators longterm. They found that students who enroll in preschool education are 39 percent less likely to be placed in special-education programs as third-graders [7]. Of the 1,010 registered voters surveyed, 61 percent consider a high-quality preschool experience \"very important\" to a student's later success and 22 percent said it is \"somewhat important.\" [7]. Lastly, crime [5]. Preschool is an effective tool for keeping kids in school and out of jail while reducing the amount of crime in our neighborhoods [6]. It [2] is an effective crime-prevention strategy [6]. A substantial body of research shows that high-quality preschool education is key in preparing children to succeed in school and career training and helps reduce the enormous financial costs of remedial work, delinquency and crime [7]. Studies have shown that quality preschool leads to better academic performance throughout life, higher earning and less criminal activity [7]. They show that high-quality preschool boosts high school graduation rates and children who do not attend high-quality preschool are far more likely to commit violent crimes [7]. To recap this rebuttal speech, I argued that pre-school education improves children's development [4]. That attending preschool helps students succeed [4]. And lastly that preschool can prevent future crime [4]. Let me wrap up this speech in a way that I hope you can relate to. Advocating welfare is like offering a hand to someone who fell. It's basic human decency [14]. Therefore, I think the motion should stand. We should subsidize preschools [2]. That concludes my speech. Thanks for listening."

		"content": "So I want to start by noting what Project Debater and I agree on. We agree that poverty is terrible. It is terrible when individuals do not have running water. It is terrible when they struggle to make ends meet and they are struggling to feed their family. It is terrible when they cannot get healthcare to cover their child, to even provide them the basics they need in life. That is all terrible, and those are all things we need to address, and none of those are addressed just because you are going to subsidize preschool. Why is that the case? Project Debater raises an interesting claim when she notes that maybe the state has the budget to do all the good things. Maybe the state has the budget to provide health care. Maybe it has the budget to provide welfare payments. Maybe it has the budget to provide running water as well as preschool. I would love to live in that world, but I don't think that is the world we live in. I think we live in a world where there are real constraints on what governments can spend money on. And even if those are not real, those are, nonetheless, political, where you have people constantly talking about the size of government debt and deficits, and who will be opposed to spending more and more money. Why does that matter? Because in the real world, both in terms of the practicalities of the amount of different good programs we have and would like to spend money on, and in the real world, on a political level, you cannot always spend more and more money just because something is good. We do need to make choices. And why, then, is preschool the bad choice to start spending money on? Now, Project Debater had a lot of evidence, all of which was saying that preschool leads to other good outcomes. Now I would first want to note is I don't think that's comparative with the other potential projects we could put in place, but let's ignore that argument for a moment. Why else do I not think those arguments were particularly convincing? I don't think it's particularly convincing because I’m not sure that subsidies even help those individuals that Project Debater thinks that we should be helping. Note, time and time again, Project Debater said high quality preschools can lead to huge improvements on individuals' lives. Maybe. But I’m not sure if you massively increase the number of people going to preschool, they're all going to be the ones going to the high-quality preschools. I don't think that just because you subsidize it, those individuals who are the poorest are those individuals who are going to be able to… whose parents are still gonna be able to spend the money and the time necessary to give their child a chance at preschool. Project Debater notes that maybe high-quality preschools will reduce crime. Maybe, but so would other measures in terms of crime prevention. So would for… and that, again, presupposes that these are high quality, and the subsidy alone allows people to go. And this is the core point I want to make: bearing in mind that it is a huge subsidy for the middle class, that realistic budget constraints we have means the money can be spent better elsewhere. But the final thing I want to note is maybe you believe all of this empirical evidence about the value of preschool. I would note that that is probably at least somewhat flawed, because what it actually picks up is that it's those individuals who are middle class, who often send their children to preschool right now - and they have plenty of advantages, so I’m not even sure preschool's a decisive one - but here's a reason why for many students, it may not even be good: that from an early age either that preschool doesn't teach a child anything, or it's pushing that child to learn in a competitive environment. At the age of three or four, when you're learning that you are… that that other child is potentially better than you, when you realize you aren't necessarily as talented as someone else, that huge psychological damage for many children may not even… may mean that preschool's actively harmful. At the end, even if you believe the preschool is good, it isn't the way… where we should spend the money, particularly given that it's a subsidy to the middle class. I’m very happy to oppose. "

		"content": "Thanks for this final opportunity to speak out in this debate and thanks, Harish Natarajan [2]. One might say that this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. But I feel differently [1]. Allow me to start with a brief rebuttal. Among other things, I think Mr. Natarajan [2] suggested that preschools should not be subsidized because this will reduce their quality [20]. I would like to offer a different view. I disagree with my opponent. Subsidizing preschools [2] will have no negative effect on their quality. If anything, the opposite is true. One of many reasons is that subsidizing attracts more skilled and qualified people to the field, improving the quality of preschools [2] for all [17]. Here is a final summary of my arguments today. My opponent claimed that preschools [2] are harmful [23]. I believe my arguments suggested that the benefits outweigh the potential disadvantages [18]. I touched upon three issues: children [5], students [5] and crime [5]. Specifically, I noted that pre-school education improves children's development [4]. In addition, I suggested that attending preschool helps students succeed [4]. And a final point to consider is that preschool can prevent future crime [4]. When this debate just started, I said that we will talk about financial issues. We did, and I am convinced that in my speeches I supplied enough data to justify support for preschools [2] [11]. At the end of the day, the benefits welfare provides outweigh the disadvantages. Welfare helps the most important segments in society, the underprivileged, the weak, the children. If we want to have a better society then we must invest in those who are less fortunate [12]. Finally, in the words of British politician and writer Benjamin Disraeli: Power has only one duty -- to secure the social welfare of the people [13]. We should subsidize preschools [2]. Thanks for your attention."

		"content": "So I think we disagree on far less than it may seem, because we agree that the people we should care about are the underprivileged, the children, those individuals who are weak. That's what Project Debater said herself. But the problem is not that preschool is necessarily harmful. I concede, in the vast majority of cases, it is much better for an individual to go to preschool than not. That is the reality that what this policy is is a huge, huge subsidy primarily to the middle class and not to those individuals who are the most vulnerable, who are the most underprivileged, and the most disadvantaged. Why is that the case? It is, first, the case, because what we said from the start is you cannot fund everything. I think this is simply empirically true, and you have to make choices, and you have to make tradeoffs. The problem with preschool in that context is twofold. The first is that a lot of that money goes to individuals who'd have sent their child to preschool anyway, those individuals from the middle class. All of those benefits exist on either side of the world. But for those individuals who are more vulnerable, this is, first, billions and billions of dollars which is probably not going to them and largely going to individuals in the middle class, and that's where the tradeoff for better health is. That's where is the tradeoff for individuals to have running water, one of the problems Project Debater identified with people who are poor, but that is a real tradeoff for those people. But second, often those are the parents who, still, even when there are subsidies, will struggle to send their child to good quality preschools. They'll struggle to send their child to good quality preschools because they don't even have the money for what is left. They'll struggle to send their child to preschools that they don't value the amount of effort and time they have to put into it. They'll struggle to send their children to preschools or when they do, it probably will be the worst preschools which exist. And, yes, quality across the board may not fall, but in some cases it will, and those poor individuals will probably be stuck in those. At the end of this debate, I don't think that Project Debater has helped those individuals she identifies as the most important but, in reality, has hurt them."
