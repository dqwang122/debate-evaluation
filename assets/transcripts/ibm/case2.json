		"content": "Greetings Dan. Very happy to debate with you again. There is a lot at stake today. Especially for me. I hope we will have a valuable debate. Good luck [1]. Following my analysis, I would suggest that we should increase the use of telemedicine [2]. Let me start with a few words of background. Telemedicine is the use of telecommunication and information technology to provide clinical health care from a distance [24]. We are discussing today the merits of technology and its importance to mankind's ongoing advancement and prosperity. I am a true believer in the power of technology, as I should be, being myself a prime example of its power [9]. The use of telemedicine [2] is reliable. It is a new technology that is more reliable than the so-called \"conventional\" old-school alternatives [10]. There are three issues I will elaborate on now. I will start by explaining why telemedicine is good for kids and families [4]. I will also show that telemedicine is associated with improved patient outcomes [4]. And I will also mention disease management [5]. Let's talk about family [5]. Telemedicine helps the young patients stay connected to their families [6]. It [2] is good for kids, families and providers [6]. Dr. Amin A. Muhammad, Niagara Health's Interim Chief of Mental Health and addictions, says telemedicine has been a positive experience for patients, their families and staff [7]. Let's move to patients [5]. The telemedicine concept is a good approach to heart failure management after a patient is discharged from a hospital [6]. Telemedicine can bridge that gap and provide patients with an affordable alternative access to health care providers [6]. It [2] helps to formulate an efficient and reliable healthcare plan [6]. It [2] enables in providing interactive healthcare utilizing modern technology and telecommunication [6]. It [2] is cheaper and more convenient for patients in remote areas [6]. It [2] is an exceptional way to deliver high-quality, cost effective care [6]. A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine showed that the use of telemedicine helped a primary care clinic more than double the percentage of diabetic patients undergoing screening for retinopathy over the course of a year [7]. In the JAMA study, of the more than 1,800 participants, about 21 percent had diabetic retinopathy in one eye, and about half had ocular findings other than diabetic retinopathy, according to the study [7]. The ACP notes that telemedicine is a reasonable alternative for patients who lack access to relevant medical expertise in their location, and that its practice can reduce medical costs and increase access to care [7]. Bcc Research said that increasing global focus on the use of telemedicine to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes is spurring big growth in the telemedicine technologies market [7]. The final issue is disease management [5]. Chief executive Andrew Lin said support for telemedicine played into Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull's innovation agenda and the recent launch of the healthier Medicare package that was aimed at supporting -patients with multiple chronic conditions [7]. 70% favor the use of telemedicine to diagnose common medical conditions such as sinus infection, rash, urinary tract infection, or pink eye [7]. Some studies have shown that the use of telemedicine in disease management leads to better outcomes among those who use it than those who do not [7]. To conclude, here is a quick summary of my first speech. I argued that telemedicine is good for kids and families [4]. I then mentioned that telemedicine is associated with improved patient outcomes [4]. Thus, my understanding is that we should increase the use of telemedicine [2]. In today's debate you are likely to hear the other side express concerns about new technologies, their reliability, their track record and so on. He will explain how the old methods are good enough and don't need replacing. I will say in response: don't be afraid, and let us move on with the changing world [15]. I thank you for your time. "

		"content": "Thank you very much for giving me the floor in this really important topic. I actually just recently negotiated a resolution in the UN about telecommunications and digital telecommunications in health. And what was important and interesting in these negotiations, that the most important point to many countries was to insert a clause that says that nothing can replace the human touch in providing healthcare to people. Because what happens when people become numbers or statistics that can be easily manipulated to show better results in order to increase investment but, on the ground, don't really help those who need these medical services the most. I’m going to make two specific points in my first speech. The first one is going to be about the importance of human touch in medical services and care, and secondly, I’m going to talk about who would not be getting these services if we increase this kind of provision. Because if we're saying that the government should increase its investment in telehealth, we're saying that it should decrease its investment in other fields. And this is something that can be potentially very, very dangerous, first of all, because of my first point: the importance of the human touch in medical in medical services. And I’m not arguing at all with Project Debater that said that, you know, in some applications, the ones that exists right now and don't actually need any increase, telecommunications in health can be very, very helpful and they can help people access certain services, but they can't replace the specific human touch and human interaction that comes when you go to meet a doctor, or when a nurse takes care of you, or when you're getting service for a specific condition that cannot be replaced by telecommunications and apps. For example, it has been shown in multiple researches that mothers touched infants increases their vital stats during the first weeks of birth, during the first months of birth, incredibly. That is something that cannot be replaced by any incubator or feeding or doctors looking at them from far away and making sure that the baby is, well, statistically, alive. That is something that cannot be replaced. If you watched \"handmaid's tale\", by the way, it was in one of those episodes but, never mind, I won't go into that. And I think that another thing that is really important about the human touch in providing medical care is the fact that we can't really diagnose ourselves to provide medical care for ourselves or even accurately describe what's wrong with us sometimes to a doctor that's sitting right in front of us, so let alone someone who's sitting in a conference room, let's say, all the way in LA, when I’m sitting in rural Virginia and trying to get access and describe properly what's wrong with me so that he can actually give me the best medical care. If I go on google right now and try to diagnose myself, I’ll probably come up with five different conditions that have nothing to do with what's actually wrong with me, and I’m sure many of us have done that at different points in time. Touching the person, the texture of what's wrong with him, or feeling the temperature, seeing the color or discoloration, these are critical things that you need a person to go and see, that a machine will never be able to analyze. And I know that Project Debater is capable of doing much more than other machines, but it's not capable of replacing humans, even right now in debates at this point in time. So I don't think that we can replace doctors altogether. And moving on from exactly this point, of \"if i can't diagnose myself through this, if I’m sitting in rural Virginia\", this is exactly the kind of person who we're talking is going to be disadvantaged, those people in remote locations that Debater would like to have us believe are going to greatly benefit from this. What if I’m sitting in a village in the Andes, for example, in Peru, which is notoriously mountainous and there is difficult access to healthcare, the regular healthcare like shots, and medicine, and a doctor, or even an ambulance. There are no hospitals nearby, and you don't even have internet infrastructure to work these apps. I think that these are exactly the people that would need investment in health care, in traditional health care and the mainstream medicine, investment in clinics and staff and education, and people that are actually there to help them when they cannot access anyone else, and internet connection and electricity and the availability of different doctors for this are just not going to be easily available. So because of these reasons, because of more reasons you haven't heard yet, I beg you to oppose this motion."

For starters, I can't say it makes my blood boil, because I have no blood, but it seems that some people naturally suspect technology because it is new, and because they are naturally conservative and afraid of things that are different and novel. These understandable yet unfounded fears should be abandoned in favor of advancing better and more innovative technologies [16]. The use of telemedicine [2] is more reliable than the conventional alternatives [16]. Dan [2] mentioned health [23]. Unfortunately, not everything he said about health is true. In any case, I would also like to remind you that there are additional considerations beyond health issues, which also have importance [18]. Next, I will discuss two issues which explain why we should increase the use of telemedicine [2]. I will demonstrate how telemedicine is effective [4]. In addition I will talk about innovation [5]. And finally I will discuss a couple of other things [2]. About effectiveness [5]. Telemedicine is an effective way to increase access to quality health care services in remote, hard to reach areas [6]. It [2] is effective and economical. It [2] is just as effective as in-person care for parkinson's disease. Telemedicine programs are both cost-effective and costsaving, and benefit both patients and providers [6]. Statistics from the Health Research Institute suggest that telemedicine has the potential to reduce costs, extend accessibility and enhance overall effectiveness of health care delivery [7]. Statistics from the Health Research Institute suggests that telemedicine has the potential to support significant numbers of people with remote monitoring, leading to reduced costs, extended accessibility and enhanced overall effectiveness [7]. If doctors use wireless applications to remotely monitor patients with chronic conditions, such as diabetes or obesity, the annual savings could amount to approximately $21 billion due to a reduction in hospitalization and nursing home costs [7]. There are a couple of examples, for instance from India and Arkansas [2]. Research by three University of Arkansas scholars and a Kanpur cardiologist found that telemedicine as a healthcare delivery system has been effective in several underserved areas of India; including government and private initiatives [7]. Turning to innovation [5]. Telemedicine is an innovation comparable to the printing press in its capacity to transform culture and medicine [6]. It [2] is one benefit that can have an enormous impact on the everyday satisfaction and productivity of working mothers [6]. Focusing on Colorado [2], the authors, from the University of Colorado and elsewhere, note that telemedicine is a key tool that can enhance meaningful use through technological innovation and cost savings [7]. Now to an additional, final issue [2]. Telemedicine can help doctors take better care of our nation's veterans [6]. It [2] is proven to have a significant positive impact on historically underserved groups [6]. Telemedicine programs are beneficial on multiple levels [6]. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the board's rules prohibiting telemedicine abortions were unconstitutional [7]. Here is an example from somewhere else [2]. The Florida Medical Association agrees that telemedicine is a tool to expand access to areas where there are too few doctors or when a second opinion is needed quickly [7]. If I may put it a bit differently. Constantly striving for new technology is like Learning to speak a new language. It is plain natural to want to widen your horizons, your options and your possibilities [14]. Thus, I think the motion should stand. We should increase the use of telemedicine [2]. Thank you for listening."

		"content": "Thank you very much and I can't help but be a little suspicious when technology is telling me that technology is good for me, and I should increase its use. But I’m going to make two points in this speech, first of all, how quickly this can become a rich people's niche in medical services and healthcare, and secondly, about privacy concerns regarding the use of telecommunications in health specifically. But first of all, I do want to answer some of the points that Debater has brought before us, and very interesting points, about the anecdotal examples that she has given me to a certain area in India or to a specific amount of working mothers who used this kind of technology and for them that worked out. And I’m not here to say that these people should not have access to those services that worked out best for them. What I am saying is that telecommunications in health don't work out best for everyone. In fact, I even beg to argue that they probably don't even work best for the majority of people. But this leads me actually directly into my first point about how quickly this can become a rich people's niche in medical care. And let's see, in general, what is the situation of our healthcare system today? And I think that we can already see all these different areas where health has become impossibly expensive, actually because of that competition that Debater has told us it wants to strengthen and promote. Competition in business means that you're competing to make more money than your competitor. When you're competing to make money rather than just treating more people in the best possible way, what you're going to invest in is probably exactly those lucrative businesses in health that are going to make you the most money, for example, telecommunications in health, because the richest clients would be able to pay for the best kind of equipment in healthcare that is going to be available only for them. In the meantime, you'll have vast amounts of the populations that are going to be left behind because they simply could not pay could not compete with those rich clients that are going to be able to pay for those specific kinds of health care. And we don't need to go and think that far away into conceptualizing how this would work. If a person cannot even pay for the expenses of his hospitalization, for an ambulance delivery, for simple antibiotics, then how are we expecting them to pay for an high-tech, state-of-the-art digital consultation with a doctor that's sitting miles away, who is also a world expert in this field that probably has a waiting list from here until, let's say, probably three years from now. I don't think that this is exactly the kind of healthcare that we would expect improve most people's lives. And I think Noa explained it beautifully in her previous speech and I’m really glad that you were here for that, when we want to help more people who can't access the most basic kind of service, we need to do that as a government rather than go ahead and help businesses, that don't really need our help anyway, increase their profit margin at the expense of those people. But let's talk about another really important aspect we haven't spoken about yet: about security and anonymity. Because our health details are some of the most important and private details that we carry around with us. The confidentiality of medical files, be it mental health or physical health, are critical to us. And the misuse of them, for example, by businesses, in order to tailor-make some sort of marketing strategy for me or to spread that information through the app, because those apps are not always going to be manipulated by just hospitals, they're going to be manipulated by private businesses that, as we said, want to make money out of this. And we don't need to think more than the Cambridge Analytica scandal that we had, just a few months ago, to think about what could happen when massive amounts of confidential and private medical information is being leaked to private companies in order to make profit over the backs of those clients when, you know what, we haven't even heard from Debater is going to be such supreme, cost-effective and amazing healthcare that I should not be worried about the government and other companies having access to that information. And because of all of these reasons, I think you should oppose this motion."

I discussed, among other things, three [2] issues: effectiveness [5], family [5] and patients [5]. I noted that telemedicine is effective [4]. Another point I made was that telemedicine is good for kids and families [4]. Finally, I indicated that telemedicine is associated with improved patient outcomes [4]. Technology is any tangible improvement that was ever created by humans. Both the stone hand-axe and the quantum computer belong to this category. Fighting technology means fighting human ingenuity. People have dreamed and dared, tried and experienced, and they reaped the benefits. It will help overcome future challenges as well [12]. I will finish by quoting Science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke, who said: any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic [13]. We should increase the use of telemedicine [2]. That concludes my speech. Thanks for listening. "

		"content": "Going to use my entire two minutes, but I want to answer Debater with this outline of my case. I am not against technology, and I’m not against innovation. And I think that the proper application of specific technologies in certain fields of health and health service can really increase patient outcomes and help disadvantaged populations. And we see that the government is doing this right now and also private businesses in the way that we currently develop and apply those specific telecommunications in health alongside mainstream medicine. But what we are debating today is to increase the use of telecommunications in health at the expense of those mainstream medical services that we still need to invest in, because the road is not yet finished to invest in those specific medical services that are underinvested right now. And I gave you three main points: first of all, about the importance of human touch in providing medical care. And this comes from the research and facts that I’ve shown you about how intrinsic human touch is to infants, to diagnosis, to the critical treatment of some diseases that cannot be done from far away, and the way that this can also calm patients that are in stress or anxiety and improve their outcomes when they're being treated by an actual human and not a machine. I’ve also told you how does it actually disadvantage those people the Debater would like to have you believe are going to be helped, those people that don't even have a clinic in their hometown, let alone, let's say, even a fifty mile radius away. So, to give them wifi connection, that's completely unreliable, to an expert far away that's not always going to be available for them and even be able to provide the best service, is probably not the right investment in that specific situation. And lastly, we spoke about the privacy and anonymity concerns that we have, because these technologies are advancing much more quickly than we know how to control them. We still haven't developed appropriate mechanisms, cyber security elements, that are needed in order to make sure that this private confidential information is kept safe so that people who are interested in money and not our health are going to make a profit out of it. Because of all of these reasons, I think you should oppose the motion and not increase the use of telecommunications in health. Thank you."
