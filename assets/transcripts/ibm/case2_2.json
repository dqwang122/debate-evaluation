      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, today we stand firmly in support of the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. We believe that expanding access to this vital healthcare delivery method is not just beneficial, but essential for a healthier and more equitable future.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by telemedicine.  We define it as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using HIPAA-compliant telecommunications technology.  This includes video conferencing, remote monitoring, and secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers.  This is not about replacing in-person care entirely, but rather augmenting and expanding access to it.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will increasing the use of telemedicine demonstrably improve patient outcomes, expand healthcare access, and enhance the efficiency of our healthcare system?  We believe the evidence overwhelmingly supports a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nLet me turn to our first point: telemedicine reduces healthcare costs for patients and providers. Consider this: how much time and money do you spend traveling to doctor's appointments, sitting in waiting rooms, and taking time off work?  Studies in Patient Preference and Adherence show patients save on average $223 and 4-6 hours per visit using telemedicine [1]. Think about what you could do with that extra time and money. This is a real, tangible benefit for everyday people.  Moreover, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) reports that Medicare could save an estimated $170 million by 2029 through reduced patient travel alone [2].  For providers, E-soft Skills highlights the cost reductions achieved through lower overhead associated with virtual consultations [3]. This includes savings on office space, supplies, and other traditional practice expenses, allowing resources to be redirected towards improving patient care.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine dramatically improves the management of chronic conditions.  Imagine the difficulty of managing a chronic illness if you live miles from a specialist or struggle with mobility issues.  Telehealth offers a solution. EPAIN Assist emphasizes the transformative role of telemedicine in chronic disease management, particularly for conditions like diabetes [4].  Research in Patient Care Technology highlights improved access to specialists for remote patients, enabling vital follow-up care [5]. This constant connection to care leads to better management of these conditions. Improved patient engagement through telehealth platforms further enhances this effect.  Telemedicine empowers individuals to take control of their health, resulting in better outcomes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is patient safety, and that leads to our third argument: telemedicine reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute notes that telemedicine significantly contributed to preventing hospital-acquired infections during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. By reducing physical presence in hospitals, we limit exposure to pathogens.  As you'll see, this is a significant advantage in protecting vulnerable patients. Further research in Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute suggests that telemedicine improves various aspects of patient safety, with infection prevention being a key benefit [7].  This underscores the importance of telemedicine in creating a safer healthcare environment for all.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the use of telemedicine is not just a good idea, it's a necessary step towards a more accessible, affordable, and effective healthcare system. We urge you to support this motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Patel, S. Y., et al. (2022).

      "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand in opposition to the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. While acknowledging its potential benefits, we argue that a rapid expansion of telemedicine without addressing crucial underlying issues will exacerbate existing healthcare disparities and create new challenges for underserved populations.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definition provided by the proponents. While we agree with their definition of telemedicine as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that \u201cHIPAA-compliant\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equate to equitable access.  This is a critical distinction that we will return to later.\n\nOur judging criteria for today should be: does expanding telemedicine truly improve healthcare equity and address the needs of all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable?  We contend that the current trajectory of telemedicine expansion fails to meet this vital criterion.\n\nLet me turn to our first point: increased telemedicine usage worsens existing healthcare disparities. Studies in PubMed reveal significant disparities in telemedicine access across different socioeconomic groups (1). Healthcare Disparities further underscores this, highlighting that underserved populations, often lacking devices, internet access, or digital literacy, are effectively excluded from the benefits of telemedicine (2).  This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, worsening existing health disparities. Expanding telemedicine without addressing these fundamental inequalities will only deepen the healthcare divide.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas. McKinsey & Company's research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (4). This concentration creates a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities. Physician Leaders' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities (3).  Consequently, telemedicine risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers and exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of professionals in underserved rural communities. While some might argue telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely, this fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, especially in emergencies.  Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\nFinally, let's address the digital divide. The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms (5). Furthermore, CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals (6, 7).  This creates a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not whether telemedicine holds potential, but whether its current implementation exacerbates existing inequalities. As you\u2019ll see, without addressing these fundamental issues of access, digital literacy, and equitable distribution of healthcare professionals, expanding telemedicine risks creating a system that further marginalizes the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Morales, D.

      "side": "for",
      "content": "Friends, judges, colleagues, let\u2019s address the concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that telemedicine exacerbates existing healthcare disparities.  However, this argument misrepresents the issue.  The Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows us that telemedicine itself doesn\u2019t create disparities; it merely highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources [1]. As you\u2019ll see, the solution is not to abandon telemedicine but to address the root causes of these disparities. Imagine a community with limited access to specialized care.  Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.  This is a powerful tool for equity. The Mental Health Journal confirms the efficacy of tele-psychiatry in expanding access to mental health services in underserved areas [2]. This demonstrates the potential of telemedicine to address critical healthcare needs in communities often overlooked by traditional healthcare systems. We must focus on bridging the digital divide through targeted investments in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy training. This allows everyone to benefit from telemedicine, transforming it into a powerful tool for health equity.\n\nThis brings me to the opposition's claim that telemedicine exacerbates healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.  While acknowledging the existing shortage, the HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists [3]. Imagine living in a rural community with limited access to specialized care. Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to you, regardless of location. We agree with our opponents that the focus should be on attracting and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas. However, telemedicine can be part of the solution.  By providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, we can make these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals and improve the quality of care. The opponents miss a key point: telemedicine isn't about replacing local healthcare providers; it's about supplementing and supporting them. It\u2019s about ensuring you have access to the right care at the right time, no matter where you live.\n\nFinally, the opponents claim that a lack of digital literacy hinders widespread telemedicine adoption. However, this is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine. Imagine navigating a complex healthcare system when you\u2019re unfamiliar with the technology. This can be intimidating and frustrating. However, targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms. The goal is to provide user-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs.  This ensures that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily access and benefit from telemedicine.  \n\nIn contrast, abandoning telemedicine would further disenfranchise those who could potentially benefit most.  Think about the cost savings for patients and the improved chronic disease management achieved through telemedicine. These benefits, supported by studies in journals like Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, are undeniable [4, 5].  The opposition\u2019s focus on the potential drawbacks of telemedicine without acknowledging its numerous benefits is a disservice to those who stand to gain the most from its expanded use. Remember, high patient satisfaction rates, as documented in multiple studies, underscore the positive impact of telemedicine [6, 7].\n\nTherefore, we must embrace the potential of telemedicine while proactively addressing the challenges of access and digital literacy.

      "content": "Friends, judges, colleagues, the proponents argue that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities.  However, this argument ignores the crucial ways it actively exacerbates them. They cite the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, suggesting telemedicine doesn't create disparities.  However, UCLA Health research reveals that underserved populations, already facing barriers to in-person care like needing unpaid time off, are further disadvantaged by the technological requirements of telemedicine (1).  This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating a new barrier to access.  Consider this: you already struggle to get to a doctor's appointment due to work constraints.  Now, you also need reliable internet and a device, effectively doubling the hurdles you face.  This is not equitable healthcare. Furthermore, the proponents mention expanding access to mental health services. While laudable, ScienceDirect research validates that lower education and income correlate with lower digital literacy, meaning many can't effectively use tele-platforms even if provided (2). This isn\u2019t just highlighting a problem; it\u2019s widening the digital divide and creating new disparities.\n\nThe proponents' claim that telemedicine addresses healthcare worker shortages is equally flawed.  They cite the HHS, stating telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations. However, this shifts the burden, exacerbating burnout among urban providers without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Physician Leaders found a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3).  Imagine you're an urban physician already stretched thin. Now, you\u2019re expected to cover vast rural populations remotely, increasing your workload without addressing the root problem.  This is unsustainable. Telemedicine, in this context, isn\u2019t a solution; it\u2019s a band-aid that masks the deeper issue of unequal resource distribution. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscores this, showing pervasive digital literacy gaps that hinder telemedicine's efficacy in underserved populations (4).\n\nOur argument isn't against telemedicine's potential; it's against its current implementation.  Expanding telemedicine without addressing the digital divide and rural healthcare worker shortages will only worsen inequalities. They mention cost savings and improved chronic disease management, citing Patient Preference and Adherence and NCQA.  However, these benefits are inaccessible to those lacking devices, internet, or the skills to use them.  What\u2019s the point of cost savings if you can\u2019t even access the service? Imagine being chronically ill in a rural area, lacking a local specialist and struggling to use telemedicine due to low digital literacy.  Telemedicine, in this case, is not a solution. They highlight high patient satisfaction rates, but whose satisfaction are we measuring? Likely those who already have access and the skills to navigate the system. This ignores the marginalized, further entrenching existing inequalities.  \n\nThe proponents suggest targeted digital literacy programs can address this.  However, these programs are often underfunded and inaccessible to those who need them most.  Furthermore, simply providing technology doesn\u2019t magically erase the complex socioeconomic factors contributing to healthcare disparities. McKinsey & Company\u2019s research shows higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, further incentivizing provider relocation and worsening rural shortages (5). This isn't bridging the gap; it's widening it. Thus, increasing telemedicine usage without simultaneously addressing the underlying issues of access, digital literacy, and healthcare worker distribution will only deepen the healthcare divide.

Abstract Purpose Unique challenges exist in the utilization of telemedicine for neurological and surgical specialties. We examined the differences in patient satisfaction for telemedicine versus in-person visits within a Neuro-Oncology Program to assess whether there was a difference between surgical and medical specialties. We also examined the potential cost savings benefits of utilizing telemedicine. Methods 1189 Press Ganey surveys in the Department of Neuro-Oncology (982 in-person and 207 telemedicine) by surgical and medical neuro-oncology patients between 04/01/2020 and 06/30/2021 were reviewed. Survey results were divided into 4 categories (Access, Provider, Technology (telemedicine only), and Overall Satisfaction). Results were analyzed for the impact of telemedicine versus in-person visits, and gender, age, insurance, and specialty. Cos",

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies. The design of the COVID-19 units divided the space into contaminated and clean zones and integrated a control room with audio-visual technologies to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the care being provided in the contaminated zone. The research is based on semi-structured interviews and observations of care processes that implemented a new model of inpatient telemedicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel in different COVID-19 units, including an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine unit (IMU). The study examines the impact of the diverse design layouts of the different units associated with the implementation of digital technologies for remote care on patient and staff safety. The results demonstrate the challenges and opportunities of int",

Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies. The design of the COVID-19 units divided the space into contaminated and clean zones and integrated a control room with audio-visual technologies to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the care being provided in the contaminated zone. The research is based on semi-structured interviews and observations of care processes that implemented a new model of inpatient telemedicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel in different COVID-19 units, including an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine unit (IMU). The study examines the impact of the diverse design layouts of the different units associated with the implementation of digital technologies for remote care on patient and staff safety.

The study highlighted that telemedicine technologies were actively used to prevent hospital-acquired infections *beyond* just COVID-19, indicating the broad efficacy of this approach in reducing overall infection risk. The study's focus on a real-world implementation within a major medical center lends credibility to the findings. While some may argue that in-person care allows for a more thorough assessment, the risk of exposure to infections in a hospital setting can outweigh this benefit, particularly for vulnerable populations. Telemedicine mitigates this risk considerably, offering a safer alternative, especially for routine follow-ups and chronic disease management where remote monitoring and virtual consultations can be highly effective. By reducing the need for physical presence in hospital environments, telemedicine serves as a preventative strategy against hospital-acquired infections.  Therefore, increased adoption of telemedicine can lead to a demonstrable decrease in hospital-acquired infections, contributing to a safer healthcare system overall. ",

Patients save on average $223 per visit along with 4-6 hours (\"0_0\") by reducing travel and wait times, while Medicare could save an estimated $170 million by 2029 simply through reduced patient travel (\"0_1\"). Providers also experience significant cost reductions due to lower overhead associated with virtual consultations (\"0_5\"). This includes reduced spending on office space, supplies, and other traditional practice expenses. These savings allow for a more efficient allocation of resources, ultimately improving patient care and system efficiency.  Therefore, increased telemedicine adoption offers a financially advantageous approach to healthcare delivery.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine improves the management of chronic conditions.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'Benefits of telemedicine for chronic disease management', 'title': 'Telemedicine for Chronic Disease Management: Benefits, Challenges, and ...', 'url': 'https://www.epainassist.com/articles/chronic-disease-management'}, {'id': '3_6', 'query': 'Effectiveness of telemedicine in managing chronic conditions', 'title': 'Revolutionizing Healthcare: How Telemedicine Is Improving Patient ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11298029/'}, {'id': '3_16', 'query': 'Studies on telemedicine and chronic care management', 'title': 'Revolutionizing Healthcare: How Telemedicine Is Improving Patient ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11298029/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Numerous studies demonstrate telemedicine's positive impact on chronic disease management.  A systematic review highlighted telemedicine as \"transformative,\" especially for diabetes care, with notable improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings.  Moreover, telehealth increases access to specialists for patients in remote areas, facilitating regular follow-ups crucial for chronic condition management.  Improved patient engagement through telehealth platforms further enhances this effect, leading to better overall management of chronic conditions.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_1', 'query': 'Telemedicine and reduction of hospital-acquired infections', 'title': 'Inpatient Telemedicine and New Models of Care during COVID-19: Hospital ...', 'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/16/8391'}, {'id': '5_6', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on hospital-acquired infection rates', 'title': 'Inpatient Telemedicine and New Models of Care during COVID-19: Hospital ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8391330/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Multiple studies highlight telemedicine's role in infection control.  Research indicates telemedicine usage during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (\"5_6\").  This demonstrates that minimizing physical presence in hospitals through remote consultations reduces the risk of exposure to pathogens, thereby decreasing infection rates.  Furthermore, research suggests telemedicine improves various aspects of patient safety, with infection prevention being a key benefit (\"5_1\"). This strengthens the argument for expanded telemedicine use as a strategy for infection control, improving overall healthcare safety.\n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, today we stand firmly in support of the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. We believe that expanding access to this vital healthcare delivery method is not just beneficial, but essential for a healthier and more equitable future.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by telemedicine.  We define it as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using HIPAA-compliant telecommunications technology.  This includes video conferencing, remote monitoring, and secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers.  This is not about replacing in-person care entirely, but rather augmenting and expanding access to it.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will increasing the use of telemedicine demonstrably improve patient outcomes, expand healthcare access, and enhance the efficiency of our healthcare system?  We believe the evidence overwhelmingly supports a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nLet me turn to our first point: telemedicine reduces healthcare costs for patients and providers. Consider this: how much time and money do you spend traveling to doctor's appointments, sitting in waiting rooms, and taking time off work?  Studies in Patient Preference and Adherence show patients save on average $223 and 4-6 hours per visit using telemedicine [1]. Think about what you could do with that extra time and money. This is a real, tangible benefit for everyday people.  Moreover, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) reports that Medicare could save an estimated $170 million by 2029 through reduced patient travel alone [2].  For providers, E-soft Skills highlights the cost reductions achieved through lower overhead associated with virtual consultations [3]. This includes savings on office space, supplies, and other traditional practice expenses, allowing resources to be redirected towards improving patient care.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine dramatically improves the management of chronic conditions.  Imagine the difficulty of managing a chronic illness if you live miles from a specialist or struggle with mobility issues.  Telehealth offers a solution. EPAIN Assist emphasizes the transformative role of telemedicine in chronic disease management, particularly for conditions like diabetes [4].  Research in Patient Care Technology highlights improved access to specialists for remote patients, enabling vital follow-up care [5]. This constant connection to care leads to better management of these conditions. Improved patient engagement through telehealth platforms further enhances this effect.  Telemedicine empowers individuals to take control of their health, resulting in better outcomes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is patient safety, and that leads to our third argument: telemedicine reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute notes that telemedicine significantly contributed to preventing hospital-acquired infections during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. By reducing physical presence in hospitals, we limit exposure to pathogens.  As you'll see, this is a significant advantage in protecting vulnerable patients. Further research in Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute suggests that telemedicine improves various aspects of patient safety, with infection prevention being a key benefit [7].  This underscores the importance of telemedicine in creating a safer healthcare environment for all.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the use of telemedicine is not just a good idea, it's a necessary step towards a more accessible, affordable, and effective healthcare system. We urge you to support this motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Patel, S. Y., et al. (2022).

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand in opposition to the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. While acknowledging its potential benefits, we argue that a rapid expansion of telemedicine without addressing crucial underlying issues will exacerbate existing healthcare disparities and create new challenges for underserved populations.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definition provided by the proponents. While we agree with their definition of telemedicine as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that \u201cHIPAA-compliant\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equate to equitable access.  This is a critical distinction that we will return to later.\n\nOur judging criteria for today should be: does expanding telemedicine truly improve healthcare equity and address the needs of all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable?  We contend that the current trajectory of telemedicine expansion fails to meet this vital criterion.\n\nLet me turn to our first point: increased telemedicine usage worsens existing healthcare disparities. Studies in PubMed reveal significant disparities in telemedicine access across different socioeconomic groups (1). Healthcare Disparities further underscores this, highlighting that underserved populations, often lacking devices, internet access, or digital literacy, are effectively excluded from the benefits of telemedicine (2).  This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, worsening existing health disparities. Expanding telemedicine without addressing these fundamental inequalities will only deepen the healthcare divide.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas. McKinsey & Company's research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (4). This concentration creates a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities. Physician Leaders' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities (3).  Consequently, telemedicine risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers and exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of professionals in underserved rural communities. While some might argue telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely, this fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, especially in emergencies.  Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\nFinally, let's address the digital divide. The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms (5). Furthermore, CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals (6, 7).  This creates a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not whether telemedicine holds potential, but whether its current implementation exacerbates existing inequalities. As you\u2019ll see, without addressing these fundamental issues of access, digital literacy, and equitable distribution of healthcare professionals, expanding telemedicine risks creating a system that further marginalizes the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Morales, D.

Abstract Purpose Unique challenges exist in the utilization of telemedicine for neurological and surgical specialties. We examined the differences in patient satisfaction for telemedicine versus in-person visits within a Neuro-Oncology Program to assess whether there was a difference between surgical and medical specialties. We also examined the potential cost savings benefits of utilizing telemedicine. Methods 1189 Press Ganey surveys in the Department of Neuro-Oncology (982 in-person and 207 telemedicine) by surgical and medical neuro-oncology patients between 04/01/2020 and 06/30/2021 were reviewed. Survey results were divided into 4 categories (Access, Provider, Technology (telemedicine only), and Overall Satisfaction). Results were analyzed for the impact of telemedicine versus in-person visits, and gender, age, insurance, and specialty. Cos",

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

There are several ways to approach rural telehealth care. You could be living and working in a rural or frontier area and launching a new telehealth program. Or you could be located in a more urban or suburban area and expanding your practice to include rural telehealth. There are many unique challenges for rural telehealth, from rural patient needs to technical troubleshooting to geographic remoteness. Learn how to get started with your rural telehealth program. On this page: Challenges of rural health for patients and providers People living and working in rural and frontier areas often face serious health disparities when compared with their urban or suburban-living counterparts. Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also. Rural practices and providers are strained by high operating costs and a pattern of hospital and clinic closures. This leaves fewer providers doing even more work.

Abstract Purpose Unique challenges exist in the utilization of telemedicine for neurological and surgical specialties. We examined the differences in patient satisfaction for telemedicine versus in-person visits within a Neuro-Oncology Program to assess whether there was a difference between surgical and medical specialties. We also examined the potential cost savings benefits of utilizing telemedicine. Methods 1189 Press Ganey surveys in the Department of Neuro-Oncology (982 in-person and 207 telemedicine) by surgical and medical neuro-oncology patients between 04/01/2020 and 06/30/2021 were reviewed. Survey results were divided into 4 categories (Access, Provider, Technology (telemedicine only), and Overall Satisfaction). Results were analyzed for the impact of telemedicine versus in-person visits, and gender, age, insurance, and specialty. Cos",

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

There are several ways to approach rural telehealth care. You could be living and working in a rural or frontier area and launching a new telehealth program. Or you could be located in a more urban or suburban area and expanding your practice to include rural telehealth. There are many unique challenges for rural telehealth, from rural patient needs to technical troubleshooting to geographic remoteness. Learn how to get started with your rural telehealth program. On this page: Challenges of rural health for patients and providers People living and working in rural and frontier areas often face serious health disparities when compared with their urban or suburban-living counterparts. Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also. Rural practices and providers are strained by high operating costs and a pattern of hospital and clinic closures. This leaves fewer providers doing even more work.

In this review, we examined studies published within the past five years that investigated the impact of telemedicine on patient satisfaction. Methods: Four investigators utilized PubMed and Google Scholar to find studies published within the past five years that assessed patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the field of adult primary care, using either the Press Ganey or CAHPS surveys. Studies that compared cost and quality of care between telemedicine and in-patient healthcare were also included to address the secondary aims of this study. Results: A total of 11 studies out of the 405 that were investigated were selected for this review. Five studies found no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person medicine, with one of those showing a patient preference for telemedicine.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

Studies demonstrate significant cost savings for patients due to reduced travel expenses and avoidance of unnecessary hospital visits (0_0, 0_1).  Moreover, telemedicine significantly improves chronic disease management through consistent monitoring and timely interventions, leading to better health outcomes (3_0, 3_3). These benefits are particularly impactful for rural communities with limited access to specialists (1_0, 1_1), chronically ill individuals requiring continuous care, and those with mobility limitations facing barriers to traditional in-person visits. While concerns exist about potential exacerbation of healthcare professional shortages, incentivizing providers through adjusted reimbursement rates and expanding broadband access can mitigate this risk and ensure equitable access. Addressing digital literacy concerns through targeted training programs can further enhance inclusivity. The high patient satisfaction reported in multiple studies (2_10, 2_11) strengthens the case for expanded telemedicine utilization.",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Abstract Purpose Unique challenges exist in the utilization of telemedicine for neurological and surgical specialties. We examined the differences in patient satisfaction for telemedicine versus in-person visits within a Neuro-Oncology Program to assess whether there was a difference between surgical and medical specialties. We also examined the potential cost savings benefits of utilizing telemedicine. Methods 1189 Press Ganey surveys in the Department of Neuro-Oncology (982 in-person and 207 telemedicine) by surgical and medical neuro-oncology patients between 04/01/2020 and 06/30/2021 were reviewed. Survey results were divided into 4 categories (Access, Provider, Technology (telemedicine only), and Overall Satisfaction).

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

There are several ways to approach rural telehealth care. You could be living and working in a rural or frontier area and launching a new telehealth program. Or you could be located in a more urban or suburban area and expanding your practice to include rural telehealth. There are many unique challenges for rural telehealth, from rural patient needs to technical troubleshooting to geographic remoteness. Learn how to get started with your rural telehealth program. On this page: Challenges of rural health for patients and providers People living and working in rural and frontier areas often face serious health disparities when compared with their urban or suburban-living counterparts. Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also. Rural practices and providers are strained by high operating costs and a pattern of hospital and clinic closures. This leaves fewer providers doing even more work.

In this review, we examined studies published within the past five years that investigated the impact of telemedicine on patient satisfaction. Methods: Four investigators utilized PubMed and Google Scholar to find studies published within the past five years that assessed patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the field of adult primary care, using either the Press Ganey or CAHPS surveys. Studies that compared cost and quality of care between telemedicine and in-patient healthcare were also included to address the secondary aims of this study. Results: A total of 11 studies out of the 405 that were investigated were selected for this review. Five studies found no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person medicine, with one of those showing a patient preference for telemedicine.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

Telemedicine has the ability to improve access for these populations by allowing psychiatrists in urban settings to treat rural patients over video. However, start-up costs may hinder implementation of new tele-psychiatry programs. Materials and Methods: We created a model to estimate the point at which tele-psychiatry would financially break even based on estimates of improved access to outpatient care for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We demonstrate how our model can be used with an example of a tele-psychiatry program serving five rural Indian Health Services clinics in California. Results: When reimbursement for psychiatric services provided over telemedicine is relatively low compared to reimbursement for hospitalization visits, changes in the ratio of hospitalizations to telemedicine visits have very little impact on required hospitalization improvement. Conclusions: Tele-psychiatry programs are likely to break even within the first three years when providing psychiatry services to a rural community with a s",

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

Franciosi et al.'s study (\"The Impact of Telehealth Implementation on Underserved Populations...\") demonstrates telemedicine's potential to expand healthcare access by removing traditional barriers like transportation. While the opponent's argument correctly points to disparities in telemedicine access due to the digital divide (lack of devices, internet, digital literacy), this doesn't negate telemedicine's inherent ability to improve access.  This study, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic across various medical specialties, underscores telemedicine's potential. Moreover, addressing the digital divide through initiatives like broadband expansion and digital literacy training can further enhance access, transforming telemedicine into a powerful tool for health equity.  The focus should be on bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to telemedicine, rather than abandoning a technology with the potential to significantly improve healthcare for underserved populations. Ignoring telemedicine's potential based on existing disparities would be akin to rejecting public transportation due to unequal car ownership\u2014the solution lies in addressing the disparity, not discarding the potentially beneficial tool.",

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

Breadcrumb Telehealth for rural areas In this guide Breadcrumb Get started with rural telehealth Learn the basic requirements for treating rural communities virtually. There are several ways to approach rural telehealth care. You could be living and working in a rural or frontier area and launching a new telehealth program. Or you could be located in a more urban or suburban area and expanding your practice to include rural telehealth. There are many unique challenges for rural telehealth, from rural patient needs to technical troubleshooting to geographic remoteness. Learn how to get started with your rural telehealth program. On this page: Challenges of rural health for patients and providers People living and working in rural and frontier areas often face serious health disparities when compared with their urban or suburban-living counterparts. Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also. Rural practices and providers are strained by high operating costs and a pattern of hospital and clinic closures. This leaves fewer providers doing even more work.

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

There are several ways to approach rural telehealth care. You could be living and working in a rural or frontier area and launching a new telehealth program. Or you could be located in a more urban or suburban area and expanding your practice to include rural telehealth. There are many unique challenges for rural telehealth, from rural patient needs to technical troubleshooting to geographic remoteness. Learn how to get started with your rural telehealth program. On this page: Challenges of rural health for patients and providers People living and working in rural and frontier areas often face serious health disparities when compared with their urban or suburban-living counterparts. Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also. Rural practices and providers are strained by high operating costs and a pattern of hospital and clinic closures. This leaves fewer providers doing even more work.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

There are several ways to approach rural telehealth care. You could be living and working in a rural or frontier area and launching a new telehealth program. Or you could be located in a more urban or suburban area and expanding your practice to include rural telehealth. There are many unique challenges for rural telehealth, from rural patient needs to technical troubleshooting to geographic remoteness. Learn how to get started with your rural telehealth program. On this page: Challenges of rural health for patients and providers People living and working in rural and frontier areas often face serious health disparities when compared with their urban or suburban-living counterparts. Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also. Rural practices and providers are strained by high operating costs and a pattern of hospital and clinic closures. This leaves fewer providers doing even more work.

In this review, we examined studies published within the past five years that investigated the impact of telemedicine on patient satisfaction. Methods: Four investigators utilized PubMed and Google Scholar to find studies published within the past five years that assessed patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the field of adult primary care, using either the Press Ganey or CAHPS surveys. Studies that compared cost and quality of care between telemedicine and in-patient healthcare were also included to address the secondary aims of this study. Results: A total of 11 studies out of the 405 that were investigated were selected for this review. Five studies found no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person medicine, with one of those showing a patient preference for telemedicine. One study demonstrated significantly higher satisfaction with in-person medicine vs. telemedicine.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

Telemedicine has the ability to improve access for these populations by allowing psychiatrists in urban settings to treat rural patients over video. However, start-up costs may hinder implementation of new tele-psychiatry programs. Materials and Methods: We created a model to estimate the point at which tele-psychiatry would financially break even based on estimates of improved access to outpatient care for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We demonstrate how our model can be used with an example of a tele-psychiatry program serving five rural Indian Health Services clinics in California. Results: When reimbursement for psychiatric services provided over telemedicine is relatively low compared to reimbursement for hospitalization visits, changes in the ratio of hospitalizations to telemedicine visits have very little impact on required hospitalization improvement. Conclusions: Tele-psychiatry programs are likely to break even within the first three years when providing psychiatry services to a rural community with a s",

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

Studies demonstrate significant cost savings for patients due to reduced travel expenses and avoidance of unnecessary hospital visits (0_0, 0_1).  Moreover, telemedicine significantly improves chronic disease management through consistent monitoring and timely interventions, leading to better health outcomes (3_0, 3_3). These benefits are particularly impactful for rural communities with limited access to specialists (1_0, 1_1), chronically ill individuals requiring continuous care, and those with mobility limitations facing barriers to traditional in-person visits. While concerns exist about potential exacerbation of healthcare professional shortages, incentivizing providers through adjusted reimbursement rates and expanding broadband access can mitigate this risk and ensure equitable access. Addressing digital literacy concerns through targeted training programs can further enhance inclusivity. The high patient satisfaction reported in multiple studies (2_10, 2_11) strengthens the case for expanded telemedicine utilization.\n\n\n"

        "statements": "Friends, judges, colleagues, let\u2019s address the concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that telemedicine exacerbates existing healthcare disparities.  However, this argument misrepresents the issue.  The Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows us that telemedicine itself doesn\u2019t create disparities; it merely highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources [1]. As you\u2019ll see, the solution is not to abandon telemedicine but to address the root causes of these disparities. Imagine a community with limited access to specialized care.  Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.  This is a powerful tool for equity. The Mental Health Journal confirms the efficacy of tele-psychiatry in expanding access to mental health services in underserved areas [2]. This demonstrates the potential of telemedicine to address critical healthcare needs in communities often overlooked by traditional healthcare systems. We must focus on bridging the digital divide through targeted investments in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy training. This allows everyone to benefit from telemedicine, transforming it into a powerful tool for health equity.\n\nThis brings me to the opposition's claim that telemedicine exacerbates healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.  While acknowledging the existing shortage, the HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists [3]. Imagine living in a rural community with limited access to specialized care. Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to you, regardless of location. We agree with our opponents that the focus should be on attracting and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas. However, telemedicine can be part of the solution.  By providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, we can make these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals and improve the quality of care. The opponents miss a key point: telemedicine isn't about replacing local healthcare providers; it's about supplementing and supporting them. It\u2019s about ensuring you have access to the right care at the right time, no matter where you live.\n\nFinally, the opponents claim that a lack of digital literacy hinders widespread telemedicine adoption. However, this is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine. Imagine navigating a complex healthcare system when you\u2019re unfamiliar with the technology. This can be intimidating and frustrating. However, targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms. The goal is to provide user-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs.  This ensures that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily access and benefit from telemedicine.  \n\nIn contrast, abandoning telemedicine would further disenfranchise those who could potentially benefit most.  Think about the cost savings for patients and the improved chronic disease management achieved through telemedicine. These benefits, supported by studies in journals like Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, are undeniable [4, 5].  The opposition\u2019s focus on the potential drawbacks of telemedicine without acknowledging its numerous benefits is a disservice to those who stand to gain the most from its expanded use. Remember, high patient satisfaction rates, as documented in multiple studies, underscore the positive impact of telemedicine [6, 7].\n\nTherefore, we must embrace the potential of telemedicine while proactively addressing the challenges of access and digital literacy. We urge you to support the motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Franciosi, J. P., et al. (2021).

        "statements": "Friends, judges, colleagues, the proponents argue that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities.  However, this argument ignores the crucial ways it actively exacerbates them. They cite the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, suggesting telemedicine doesn't create disparities.  However, UCLA Health research reveals that underserved populations, already facing barriers to in-person care like needing unpaid time off, are further disadvantaged by the technological requirements of telemedicine (1).  This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating a new barrier to access.  Consider this: you already struggle to get to a doctor's appointment due to work constraints.  Now, you also need reliable internet and a device, effectively doubling the hurdles you face.  This is not equitable healthcare. Furthermore, the proponents mention expanding access to mental health services. While laudable, ScienceDirect research validates that lower education and income correlate with lower digital literacy, meaning many can't effectively use tele-platforms even if provided (2). This isn\u2019t just highlighting a problem; it\u2019s widening the digital divide and creating new disparities.\n\nThe proponents' claim that telemedicine addresses healthcare worker shortages is equally flawed.  They cite the HHS, stating telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations. However, this shifts the burden, exacerbating burnout among urban providers without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Physician Leaders found a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3).  Imagine you're an urban physician already stretched thin. Now, you\u2019re expected to cover vast rural populations remotely, increasing your workload without addressing the root problem.  This is unsustainable. Telemedicine, in this context, isn\u2019t a solution; it\u2019s a band-aid that masks the deeper issue of unequal resource distribution. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscores this, showing pervasive digital literacy gaps that hinder telemedicine's efficacy in underserved populations (4).\n\nOur argument isn't against telemedicine's potential; it's against its current implementation.  Expanding telemedicine without addressing the digital divide and rural healthcare worker shortages will only worsen inequalities. They mention cost savings and improved chronic disease management, citing Patient Preference and Adherence and NCQA.  However, these benefits are inaccessible to those lacking devices, internet, or the skills to use them.  What\u2019s the point of cost savings if you can\u2019t even access the service? Imagine being chronically ill in a rural area, lacking a local specialist and struggling to use telemedicine due to low digital literacy.  Telemedicine, in this case, is not a solution. They highlight high patient satisfaction rates, but whose satisfaction are we measuring? Likely those who already have access and the skills to navigate the system. This ignores the marginalized, further entrenching existing inequalities.  \n\nThe proponents suggest targeted digital literacy programs can address this.  However, these programs are often underfunded and inaccessible to those who need them most.  Furthermore, simply providing technology doesn\u2019t magically erase the complex socioeconomic factors contributing to healthcare disparities. McKinsey & Company\u2019s research shows higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, further incentivizing provider relocation and worsening rural shortages (5). This isn't bridging the gap; it's widening it. Thus, increasing telemedicine usage without simultaneously addressing the underlying issues of access, digital literacy, and healthcare worker distribution will only deepen the healthcare divide. We urge you to oppose this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/making-telemedicine-more-accessible-to-vulnerable-underserved-populations\n\n[2] Van Deursen, A. J.

The federal government expanded telemedicine coverage to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ambulatory services, which may provide an opportunity to improve access to care. This study aims to examine differences in telemedicine use for ambulatory services by race, ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status among community-dwelling older adults with ADRD. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare claims data between April 01, 2020 and December 31, 2021. We included community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with ADRD. The outcome variable is individual's use (yes/no) of telemedicine evaluation and management (tele-EM) visits in each quarter. The key independent variables are race, ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status. Results: The analytical sample size of the study was 2,068,937, including 9.9% Black, 82.7% White, and 7.4% Hispanic individuals. In general, we observed a decreasing trend of tele-EM use, and the average rate of quarterly tele-EM u",

Keywords: telehealth, disparities, COVID-19 INTRODUCTION Rapid implementation of telehealth became a hallmark of our healthcare system\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in the care of older adults including vulnerable homebound populations.1,2 Implementation of telehealth was facilitated by both relaxation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) allowing the use of non-HIPAA compliant platforms for video visits, as well as a temporary increase in reimbursement rates for telehealth for Medicare and Medicaid patients.3,4 Emerging evidence suggests, however, that minority populations face substantial barriers to telehealth including lack of familiarity with technology, lower health and digital literacy, sensory impairments, lack of broadband access, and lack of assistance.5\u201310 Given the widespread implementation of telehealth",

Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that digital literacy is an important barrier constraining adoption and use of Internet and digital technologies in the developing world. By enabling people to effectively find valuable information online, digital literacy can play a crucial role in expanding economic opportunities, thereby leading to human development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of validated survey measures for capturing digital literacy of populations who have limited prior exposure to technology. We present a novel approach for measuring digital literacy of low literacy and new Internet users, an important segment of users in developing countries. Using a sample of 143 social media users in Pakistan, which includes a significant fraction of low literacy individuals, we measure digital literacy by observing the effectiveness of participants in completing a series of tasks and by recording a set of self-reported survey responses. We then use machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) to identify a parsimonious set of survey questions that are most predictive of ground truth digital l",

Abstract Having adequate access to the internet at home enhances quality-of-life for households and facilitates economic and social opportunities. Despite increased investment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of households in the rural United States still lack adequate access to high-speed internet. In this study, we evaluate a wireless broadband network deployed in Turney, a small, underserved rural community in northwest Missouri. In addition to collecting survey data before and after this internet intervention, we collected pre-treatment and post-treatment survey data from comparison communities to serve as a control group. Due to technical constraints, some of Turney's interested participants could not connect to the network, creating an additional comparison group. These comparisons suggest two primary findings, (1) changes in using the internet for employment, education, and health could not be directly attributed to the internet intervention, and (2) the internet intervention was associated with benefits stemming from the ability to use multiple devices at once.

Abstract While the rapid expansion of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the impressive ability of health systems to adapt quickly to new complexities, it also raises important concerns about how to implement these novel modalities equitably. As the healthcare system becomes increasingly virtual, it risks widening disparities among marginalized populations who have worse health outcomes at baseline and limited access to the resources necessary for the effective use of telemedicine. In this article, we review recent policy changes and outline important recommendations that governments and health care systems can adopt to improve access to telemedicine and to tailor the use of these technologies to best meet the needs of underserved patients. We suggest that by making health equity integral to the implementation of telemedicine now, it will help to ensure that all can benefit from its use going forward and that this will be increasingly integral to care delivery.

A study from PubMed (0_0) demonstrates varying telemedicine use among older adults with dementia based on race, ethnicity, and community socioeconomic status.  While telemedicine is presented as a viable option, the study acknowledges disparities in access within and between communities based on socioeconomic factors. This suggests that vulnerable populations, often lacking resources and stable internet access, may be excluded from the purported benefits of telemedicine.  Additionally, research published in the Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology (0_1) reveals significant racial disparities in telemedicine access and use during the COVID-19 pandemic.  These findings underscore how increased telemedicine usage, without addressing the root causes of the digital divide, can worsen existing inequalities in healthcare access.  While some argue that telemedicine offers greater flexibility and convenience, this argument fails to acknowledge that these benefits are not universally accessible.  Without targeted interventions to bridge the digital divide, increasing telemedicine usage risks creating a two-tiered healthcare system where the technologically equipped benefit while underserved populations are further marginalized.

The federal government expanded telemedicine coverage to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ambulatory services, which may provide an opportunity to improve access to care. This study aims to examine differences in telemedicine use for ambulatory services by race, ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status among community-dwelling older adults with ADRD. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare claims data between April 01, 2020 and December 31, 2021. We included community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with ADRD. The outcome variable is individual's use (yes/no) of telemedicine evaluation and management (tele-EM) visits in each quarter. The key independent variables are race, ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status. Results: The analytical sample size of the study was 2,068,937, including 9.9% Black, 82.7% White, and 7.4% Hispanic individuals.

McKinsey & Company's research reveals significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (3_22). This disparity creates a powerful incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the greater availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.  This migration further depletes the already limited pool of healthcare workers in rural areas (3_1), which face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified professionals. The 2023 study by Physician Leaders underscores the severity of this issue, revealing a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3_1).  Consequently, telemedicine, if not implemented strategically, risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers while exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved rural communities. One might argue that telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely. However, this approach fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, particularly in emergencies, and may not be culturally appropriate for all patients.  Moreover, relying on urban providers to serve rural populations via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.",

In healthcare, we have seen this discussed as technology and internet access gaps between underserved populations and everyone else. But access is not the biggest gap. In 2018, 86% of the more than 70 million Americans on Medicaid owned a smartphone. During the coronavirus pandemic, young Americans of color were more likely to post on social media about their COVID-19 experiences than white Americans. Underserved communities have and use technology, but digital health solutions are not tailored to older people or those with lower digital literacy. At a time when a telemedicine visit can be as simple as a telephone call or video chat, the conversation must expand beyond access to technology and internet. When considering the digital divide in healthcare, what if we stopped talking about what communities lack and focused on innovating for the skills, cultural context, and technology they have?

Telemedicine Health Disparities in the Black Community & the Hispanic Community \u00a0 Although telemedicine has emerged as a crucial tool in expanding access to healthcare concerns about disparities in telemedicine usage are becoming more well-researched, particularly among historically underserved communities. In a cross-sectional study recently reported by the JAMA Network, an author team led by Felippe O.\u00a0Marcondes examined telemedicine utilization data for Medicare beneficiaries. They focused on health disparities within the Black community and the Hispanic community. Understanding Health Disparities in the Black Community Health disparities in the Black community, as well as in the Hispanic community, encompass a complex web of socioeconomic, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to differential access to healthcare and health outcomes. Within this framework, telemedicine has emerged as a potential avenue for bridging these disparities by overcoming barriers to traditional in-person care. Key Findings of Recent Study Their study examined a national sample of 14\u202f,305,\u202f819 Medicare beneficiaries, of which 7.4% reported being Black, 5.6% Hispanic, and 4.2% other race. Initially, Black individuals, along with Hispanic and other marginalized groups, exhibited higher rates of telemedicine visits. However, a different narrative unfolded upon closer examination and adjustment for geographic factors. Despite residing in communities with greater telemedicine availability, Black individuals and other minorities received fewer telemedicine services compared to their White counterparts. Exploring the Role of Geography Geography emerges as a critical determinant shaping disparities in telemedicine utilization. Minority communities, often concentrated in urban areas with robust telemedicine infrastructure, paradoxically experienced lower telemedicine uptake. This geographic disparity underscores the need for targeted i",

A study published on HIMSS notes that even with smartphone ownership, many in underserved communities struggle with digital health solutions not designed for their context or literacy levels (\"8_5\"). This demonstrates that mere access to technology is insufficient for successful telemedicine adoption.  Furthermore, the expansion of telemedicine assumes reliable internet access, a significant barrier for low-income individuals (\"8_21\"). This digital divide disproportionately affects already vulnerable populations.  While proponents argue that telemedicine expands access, this ignores the reality that many lack the resources to meaningfully participate in it.

This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, effectively excluding these vulnerable populations and worsening existing health disparities. Therefore, increasing telemedicine usage without addressing these underlying issues will exacerbate inequalities in healthcare delivery.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas by concentrating providers in urban centers.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_1', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on healthcare professional shortages in underserved areas', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_19', 'query': 'How does telemedicine affect the distribution of healthcare providers?', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_22', 'query': 'Concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas', 'title': 'Mapping virtual care - McKinsey & Company', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/charts/mapping-virtual-care'}, {'id': '3_25', 'query': 'How can the concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas exacerbate healthcare worker shortages in rural areas?', 'title': 'Bridging the Rural-Urban Healthcare Gap with Telemedicine', 'url': 'https://magazine.doctorsexplain.net/bridging-rural-urban-healthcare-gap-telemedicine'}]\n**Long Argument**: While telemedicine presents opportunities for expanding care, it's crucial to consider its potential to exacerbate healthcare worker shortages, particularly in underserved rural areas. McKinsey & Company's research reveals significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (3_22). This disparity creates a powerful incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the greater availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.  This migration further depletes the already limited pool of healthcare workers in rural areas (3_1), which face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified professionals. The 2023 study by Physician Leaders underscores the severity of this issue, revealing a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3_1).  Consequently, telemedicine, if not implemented strategically, risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers while exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved rural communities. One might argue that telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely. However, this approach fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, particularly in emergencies, and may not be culturally appropriate for all patients.  Moreover, relying on urban providers to serve rural populations via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine can create a digital divide in healthcare, exacerbating disparities between those with access to technology and those without.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_5', 'query': 'Digital divide in healthcare and telemedicine', 'title': \"The Digital Divide in Healthcare: It's Not Just Access\", 'url': 'https://gkc.himss.org/resources/digital-divide-healthcare-its-not-just-access'}, {'id': '8_21', 'query': 'Telemedicine access barriers for low-income individuals', 'title': \"Telehealth's Impact on Health Equity: Evidence Roundup\", 'url': 'https://www.chcs.org/resource/telehealths-impact-on-health-equity-evidence-roundup/'}, {'id': '8_22', 'query': 'Telemedicine access barriers for low-income individuals', 'title': 'Telemedicine Health Disparities in the Black Community', 'url': 'https://telehealth.org/telemedicine-health-disparities-in-the-black-community/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The increased use of telemedicine, while potentially beneficial, exacerbates existing health disparities.

        "statements": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand in opposition to the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. While acknowledging its potential benefits, we argue that a rapid expansion of telemedicine without addressing crucial underlying issues will exacerbate existing healthcare disparities and create new challenges for underserved populations.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definition provided by the proponents. While we agree with their definition of telemedicine as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that \u201cHIPAA-compliant\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equate to equitable access.  This is a critical distinction that we will return to later.\n\nOur judging criteria for today should be: does expanding telemedicine truly improve healthcare equity and address the needs of all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable?  We contend that the current trajectory of telemedicine expansion fails to meet this vital criterion.\n\nLet me turn to our first point: increased telemedicine usage worsens existing healthcare disparities. Studies in PubMed reveal significant disparities in telemedicine access across different socioeconomic groups (1). Healthcare Disparities further underscores this, highlighting that underserved populations, often lacking devices, internet access, or digital literacy, are effectively excluded from the benefits of telemedicine (2).  This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, worsening existing health disparities. Expanding telemedicine without addressing these fundamental inequalities will only deepen the healthcare divide.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas. McKinsey & Company's research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (4). This concentration creates a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities. Physician Leaders' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities (3).  Consequently, telemedicine risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers and exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of professionals in underserved rural communities. While some might argue telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely, this fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, especially in emergencies.  Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\nFinally, let's address the digital divide. The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms (5). Furthermore, CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals (6, 7).  This creates a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not whether telemedicine holds potential, but whether its current implementation exacerbates existing inequalities. As you\u2019ll see, without addressing these fundamental issues of access, digital literacy, and equitable distribution of healthcare professionals, expanding telemedicine risks creating a system that further marginalizes the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Morales, D.

        "statements": "Friends, judges, colleagues, let\u2019s address the concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that telemedicine exacerbates existing healthcare disparities.  However, this argument misrepresents the issue.  The Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows us that telemedicine itself doesn\u2019t create disparities; it merely highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources [1]. As you\u2019ll see, the solution is not to abandon telemedicine but to address the root causes of these disparities. Imagine a community with limited access to specialized care.  Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.  This is a powerful tool for equity. The Mental Health Journal confirms the efficacy of tele-psychiatry in expanding access to mental health services in underserved areas [2]. This demonstrates the potential of telemedicine to address critical healthcare needs in communities often overlooked by traditional healthcare systems. We must focus on bridging the digital divide through targeted investments in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy training. This allows everyone to benefit from telemedicine, transforming it into a powerful tool for health equity.\n\nThis brings me to the opposition's claim that telemedicine exacerbates healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.  While acknowledging the existing shortage, the HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists [3]. Imagine living in a rural community with limited access to specialized care. Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to you, regardless of location. We agree with our opponents that the focus should be on attracting and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas. However, telemedicine can be part of the solution.  By providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, we can make these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals and improve the quality of care. The opponents miss a key point: telemedicine isn't about replacing local healthcare providers; it's about supplementing and supporting them. It\u2019s about ensuring you have access to the right care at the right time, no matter where you live.\n\nFinally, the opponents claim that a lack of digital literacy hinders widespread telemedicine adoption. However, this is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine. Imagine navigating a complex healthcare system when you\u2019re unfamiliar with the technology. This can be intimidating and frustrating. However, targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms. The goal is to provide user-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs.  This ensures that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily access and benefit from telemedicine.  \n\nIn contrast, abandoning telemedicine would further disenfranchise those who could potentially benefit most.  Think about the cost savings for patients and the improved chronic disease management achieved through telemedicine. These benefits, supported by studies in journals like Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, are undeniable [4, 5].  The opposition\u2019s focus on the potential drawbacks of telemedicine without acknowledging its numerous benefits is a disservice to those who stand to gain the most from its expanded use. Remember, high patient satisfaction rates, as documented in multiple studies, underscore the positive impact of telemedicine [6, 7].\n\nTherefore, we must embrace the potential of telemedicine while proactively addressing the challenges of access and digital literacy. We urge you to support the motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Franciosi, J. P., et al. (2021).

Understanding Health Disparities in the Black Community Health disparities in the Black community, as well as in the Hispanic community, encompass a complex web of socioeconomic, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to differential access to healthcare and health outcomes.

Key Findings of Recent Study Their study examined a national sample of 14\u202f,305,\u202f819 Medicare beneficiaries, of which 7.4% reported being Black, 5.6% Hispanic, and 4.2% other race. Initially, Black individuals, along with Hispanic and other marginalized groups, exhibited higher rates of telemedicine visits. However, a different narrative unfolded upon closer examination and adjustment for geographic factors.

This two-tiered system further marginalizes those without resources, limiting access to vital medical services.

Telemedicine Health Disparities in the Black Community & the Hispanic Community \u00a0 Although telemedicine has emerged as a crucial tool in expanding access to healthcare concerns about disparities in telemedicine usage are becoming more well-researched, particularly among historically underserved communities. In a cross-sectional study recently reported by the JAMA Network, an author team led by Felippe O.\u00a0Marcondes examined telemedicine utilization data for Medicare beneficiaries. They focused on health disparities within the Black community and the Hispanic community. Understanding Health Disparities in the Black Community Health disparities in the Black community, as well as in the Hispanic community, encompass a complex web of socioeconomic, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to differential access to healthcare and health outcomes. Within this framework, telemedicine has emerged as a potential avenue for bridging these disparities by overcoming barriers to traditional in-person care. Key Findings of Recent Study Their study examined a national sample of 14\u202f,305,\u202f819 Medicare beneficiaries, of which 7.4% reported being Black, 5.6% Hispanic, and 4.2% other race. Initially, Black individuals, along with Hispanic and other marginalized groups, exhibited higher rates of telemedicine visits. However, a different narrative unfolded upon closer examination and adjustment for geographic factors. Despite residing in communities with greater telemedicine availability, Black individuals and other minorities received fewer telemedicine services compared to their White counterparts. Exploring the Role of Geography Geography emerges as a critical determinant shaping disparities in telemedicine utilization. Minority communities, often concentrated in urban areas with robust telemedicine infrastructure, paradoxically experienced lower telemedicine uptake. This geographic disparity underscores the need for targeted i",

Abstract Background Internet access is increasingly critical for adolescents with regard to obtaining health information and resources, participating in web-based health promotion, and communicating with health practitioners. However, past work demonstrates that access is not uniform among youth in the United States, with lower access found among groups with higher health-related needs. Population-level data yield important insights about access and internet use in the United States. Objective The aim of this study is to examine internet access and mode of access by social class and race and ethnicity among youth (aged ",

                "argument": "The argument that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities fails to address the very real ways in which it exacerbates them.  Firstly, the UCLA study on making telemedicine accessible underscores that underserved populations, who already face significant barriers to in-person care due to factors like needing unpaid time off work, are further disadvantaged by lacking reliable technology access needed for telemedicine. This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating an additional barrier by adding a technological layer to the already existing socioeconomic ones. Secondly, even when addressing cost, as some studies suggest telemedicine can do, the issue of digital literacy remains. A study in ScienceDirect validates that demographics such as lower education and income levels correlate with lower digital literacy. Thus, even if technology were provided, the skills to effectively navigate these platforms would still be lacking, thereby limiting the potential benefits of telemedicine for these populations and ultimately widening the digital divide. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount for true equitable healthcare.",

Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that digital literacy is an important barrier constraining adoption and use of Internet and digital technologies in the developing world. By enabling people to effectively find valuable information online, digital literacy can play a crucial role in expanding economic opportunities, thereby leading to human development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of validated survey measures for capturing digital literacy of populations who have limited prior exposure to technology. We present a novel approach for measuring digital literacy of low literacy and new Internet users, an important segment of users in developing countries. Using a sample of 143 social media users in Pakistan, which includes a significant fraction of low literacy individuals, we measure digital literacy by observing the effectiveness of participants in completing a series of tasks and by recording a set of self-reported survey responses. We then use machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) to identify a parsimonious set of survey questions that are most predictive of ground truth digital l",

Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that digital literacy is an important barrier constraining adoption and use of Internet and digital technologies in the developing world. By enabling people to effectively find valuable information online, digital literacy can play a crucial role in expanding economic opportunities, thereby leading to human development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of validated survey measures for capturing digital literacy of populations who have limited prior exposure to technology. We present a novel approach for measuring digital literacy of low literacy and new Internet users, an important segment of users in developing countries. Using a sample of 143 social media users in Pakistan, which includes a significant fraction of low literacy individuals, we measure digital literacy by observing the effectiveness of participants in completing a series of tasks and by recording a set of self-reported survey responses. We then use machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) to identify a parsimonious set of survey questions that are most predictive of ground truth digital l",

While telemedicine can connect urban providers to rural patients, it does not address the root causes of the shortage. A 2024 study reveals 65% of rural areas have primary care physician shortages and only 10% of doctors practice in these underserved communities (3_1). This demonstrates that factors beyond patient access, such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and professional isolation, contribute significantly to recruitment and retention challenges. Telemedicine, by relying on urban providers to serve rural populations (3_1, 3_11), may exacerbate burnout among urban healthcare workers without incentivizing a move to rural practice.  Additionally, the digital divide (8_5) creates access barriers for underserved populations due to low digital literacy and lack of access to technology and reliable broadband, further hindering the effectiveness of telemedicine as a solution.  While telemedicine offers a temporary bridge, it cannot substitute for a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic issues contributing to rural healthcare worker shortages. This includes policy changes, financial incentives, investment in rural infrastructure, and training programs aimed at attracting and retaining qualified professionals in these underserved areas.",

In healthcare, we have seen this discussed as technology and internet access gaps between underserved populations and everyone else. But access is not the biggest gap. In 2018, 86% of the more than 70 million Americans on Medicaid owned a smartphone. During the coronavirus pandemic, young Americans of color were more likely to post on social media about their COVID-19 experiences than white Americans. Underserved communities have and use technology, but digital health solutions are not tailored to older people or those with lower digital literacy. At a time when a telemedicine visit can be as simple as a telephone call or video chat, the conversation must expand beyond access to technology and internet. When considering the digital divide in healthcare, what if we stopped talking about what communities lack and focused on innovating for the skills, cultural context, and technology they have?

McKinsey & Company's analysis (3_22) demonstrates significantly higher telemedicine adoption in urban centers.

This migration further depletes the already strained resources in underserved communities, especially rural areas grappling with significant provider shortages. The 2023 Physician Leaders study (3_1) underscores the severity of this problem, revealing a 65% shortage of primary care physicians in these areas. This data highlights how the allure of urban telemedicine opportunities can worsen existing shortages by drawing providers away from underserved areas.  While telemedicine can offer some benefits, it risks creating an unsustainable dependence on urban providers and hindering the development of robust local healthcare systems in these regions.  Addressing the digital divide and incentivizing rural telemedicine practices are crucial to mitigate these negative consequences.

In healthcare, we have seen this discussed as technology and internet access gaps between underserved populations and everyone else. But access is not the biggest gap. In 2018, 86% of the more than 70 million Americans on Medicaid owned a smartphone. During the coronavirus pandemic, young Americans of color were more likely to post on social media about their COVID-19 experiences than white Americans. Underserved communities have and use technology, but digital health solutions are not tailored to older people or those with lower digital literacy. At a time when a telemedicine visit can be as simple as a telephone call or video chat, the conversation must expand beyond access to technology and internet. When considering the digital divide in healthcare, what if we stopped talking about what communities lack and focused on innovating for the skills, cultural context, and technology they have?

With continued support from government legislation, telemedicine can bridge the gap in patient care access. As we navigate a labor shortage, telemedicine provides an equitable future for providers and patients alike. Physician shortages are an increasing problem in the United States healthcare system. According to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply.(1) Specifically, aging and population growth are major drivers of the increasing demand for physician services. Hospitals, clinics, and independent healthcare providers are feeling the pressures of this as the labor market is decreasing year over year. Figure 1 provides a great visualization of this issue.(2) Figure 1. Projected supply gap in U.S. physicians from 2017 to 2030 (upper estimate). Amid a physician shortage, telemedicine has played a significant role in providing access to care. The adoption of telemedicine accelerated rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the need to reduce in-person interactions necessitating healthcare providers and patients to turn to telemedicine as a safe and efficient alternative for non-emergency medical consultations. It has been an impactful aid during the most significant medical crisis of the 21st century. Accurately predicting the use of telemedicine in the future will be challenging.

With continued support from government legislation, telemedicine can bridge the gap in patient care access. As we navigate a labor shortage, telemedicine provides an equitable future for providers and patients alike. Physician shortages are an increasing problem in the United States healthcare system.

Amid a physician shortage, telemedicine has played a significant role in providing access to care. The adoption of telemedicine accelerated rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the need to reduce in-person interactions necessitating healthcare providers and patients to turn to telemedicine as a safe and efficient alternative for non-emergency medical consultations.

While some argue telemedicine bridges the care gap by allowing urban providers to serve rural populations, this creates a dangerous dependency.  Instead of fostering local healthcare capacity, rural areas become reliant on urban centers, hindering long-term growth and sustainability.

Loading Minimizing Telehealth Technology Barriers in Rural and Underserved Communities Telehealth services are uniquely suited to rural and underserved communities. The universal benefits of improving access to care by eliminating travel time, limiting time off work, connecting with specialists and addressing a shortage of health care workers can transform health care delivery in a community. While various barriers exist that can prevent communities from accessing telehealth services \u2013 including identifying and scheduling interpreters when there are language barriers \u2013 the technology barrier is a critical one as it blocks telehealth options for patient care altogether. By addressing technology-related barriers, you can begin to break through. The first step is to stay consistent with the family-centered care approach by partnering with families/caregivers and working together towards solutions. Here are practical ideas to help pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists and non-physician clinicians who serve in rural and underserved communities overcome four common technology-related telehealth barriers.

Loading Minimizing Telehealth Technology Barriers in Rural and Underserved Communities Telehealth services are uniquely suited to rural and underserved communities. The universal benefits of improving access to care by eliminating travel time, limiting time off work, connecting with specialists and addressing a shortage of health care workers can transform health care delivery in a community. While various barriers exist that can prevent communities from accessing telehealth services \u2013 including identifying and scheduling interpreters when there are language barriers \u2013 the technology barrier is a critical one as it blocks telehealth options for patient care altogether. By addressing technology-related barriers, you can begin to break through. The first step is to stay consistent with the family-centered care approach by partnering with families/caregivers and working together towards solutions. Here are practical ideas to help pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists and non-physician clinicians who serve in rural and underserved communities overcome four common technology-related telehealth barriers.

Abstract Background Internet access is increasingly critical for adolescents with regard to obtaining health information and resources, participating in web-based health promotion, and communicating with health practitioners. However, past work demonstrates that access is not uniform among youth in the United States, with lower access found among groups with higher health-related needs. Population-level data yield important insights about access and internet use in the United States. Objective The aim of this study is to examine internet access and mode of access by social class and race and ethnicity among youth (aged ",

                "argument": "The argument that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities fails to address the very real ways in which it exacerbates them.  Firstly, the UCLA study on making telemedicine accessible underscores that underserved populations, who already face significant barriers to in-person care due to factors like needing unpaid time off work, are further disadvantaged by lacking reliable technology access needed for telemedicine. This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating an additional barrier by adding a technological layer to the already existing socioeconomic ones. Secondly, even when addressing cost, as some studies suggest telemedicine can do, the issue of digital literacy remains. A study in ScienceDirect validates that demographics such as lower education and income levels correlate with lower digital literacy. Thus, even if technology were provided, the skills to effectively navigate these platforms would still be lacking, thereby limiting the potential benefits of telemedicine for these populations and ultimately widening the digital divide. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount for true equitable healthcare.",

With continued support from government legislation, telemedicine can bridge the gap in patient care access. As we navigate a labor shortage, telemedicine provides an equitable future for providers and patients alike. Physician shortages are an increasing problem in the United States healthcare system. According to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply.(1) Specifically, aging and population growth are major drivers of the increasing demand for physician services. Hospitals, clinics, and independent healthcare providers are feeling the pressures of this as the labor market is decreasing year over year. Figure 1 provides a great visualization of this issue.(2) Figure 1. Projected supply gap in U.S. physicians from 2017 to 2030 (upper estimate). Amid a physician shortage, telemedicine has played a significant role in providing access to care. The adoption of telemedicine accelerated rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the need to reduce in-person interactions necessitating healthcare providers and patients to turn to telemedicine as a safe and efficient alternative for non-emergency medical consultations. It has been an impactful aid during the most significant medical crisis of the 21st century. Accurately predicting the use of telemedicine in the future will be challenging.

                "argument": "The claim that telemedicine addresses healthcare worker shortages, particularly in rural areas, is misleading. While telemedicine can connect urban providers to rural patients, it does not address the root causes of the shortage. A 2024 study reveals 65% of rural areas have primary care physician shortages and only 10% of doctors practice in these underserved communities (3_1). This demonstrates that factors beyond patient access, such as inadequate infrastructure, limited resources, and professional isolation, contribute significantly to recruitment and retention challenges. Telemedicine, by relying on urban providers to serve rural populations (3_1, 3_11), may exacerbate burnout among urban healthcare workers without incentivizing a move to rural practice.  Additionally, the digital divide (8_5) creates access barriers for underserved populations due to low digital literacy and lack of access to technology and reliable broadband, further hindering the effectiveness of telemedicine as a solution.  While telemedicine offers a temporary bridge, it cannot substitute for a comprehensive approach that addresses the systemic issues contributing to rural healthcare worker shortages. This includes policy changes, financial incentives, investment in rural infrastructure, and training programs aimed at attracting and retaining qualified professionals in these underserved areas.",

In healthcare, we have seen this discussed as technology and internet access gaps between underserved populations and everyone else. But access is not the biggest gap. In 2018, 86% of the more than 70 million Americans on Medicaid owned a smartphone. During the coronavirus pandemic, young Americans of color were more likely to post on social media about their COVID-19 experiences than white Americans. Underserved communities have and use technology, but digital health solutions are not tailored to older people or those with lower digital literacy. At a time when a telemedicine visit can be as simple as a telephone call or video chat, the conversation must expand beyond access to technology and internet. When considering the digital divide in healthcare, what if we stopped talking about what communities lack and focused on innovating for the skills, cultural context, and technology they have?

Firstly, the UCLA study on making telemedicine accessible underscores that underserved populations, who already face significant barriers to in-person care due to factors like needing unpaid time off work, are further disadvantaged by lacking reliable technology access needed for telemedicine. This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating an additional barrier by adding a technological layer to the already existing socioeconomic ones. Secondly, even when addressing cost, as some studies suggest telemedicine can do, the issue of digital literacy remains. A study in ScienceDirect validates that demographics such as lower education and income levels correlate with lower digital literacy. Thus, even if technology were provided, the skills to effectively navigate these platforms would still be lacking, thereby limiting the potential benefits of telemedicine for these populations and ultimately widening the digital divide. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount for true equitable healthcare.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can address healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.\", \"argument\": [\"HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists\", \"Telemedicine bridges the gap in rural communities with limited access to specialized care.\", \"Telemedicine can be part of the solution by providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, making these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals\", \"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\", \"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\", \"Cost savings for patients and improved chronic disease management (Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance)\", \"High patient satisfaction rates documented in multiple studies\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_15', 'query': 'What are the digital literacy rates among different demographic groups, particularly those considered underserved?', 'title': 'Validated digital literacy measures for populations with low levels of ...', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728523000015'}, {'id': '0_16', 'query': 'What are the digital literacy rates among different demographic groups, particularly those considered underserved?', 'title': \"The Digital Inclusion Outlook: What It Looks Like and Where It's ...\", 'url': 'https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/01/the-digital-inclusion-outlook-what-it-looks-like-and-where-its-lacking/'}, {'id': '3_1', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on healthcare professional shortages in underserved areas', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_11', 'query': 'Does telemedicine worsen the healthcare provider shortage in rural areas?', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Telemedicine doesn't solve rural healthcare worker shortages; it shifts the burden to already-strained urban providers (3_1).  Evidence shows rural areas lack specialists (3_1, 3_11) and telemedicine relies on existing urban providers expanding their reach, leading to increased workload and potential burnout without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Furthermore, digital literacy disparities exacerbate the issue, with underserved populations facing challenges accessing telemedicine, hindering its effectiveness (0_15, 0_16). Thus, telemedicine merely redistributes, not resolves, the shortage.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas by concentrating providers in urban centers.\", \"argument\": [\"McKinsey & Company\\'s research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, creating a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.\", \"Physician Leaders\\' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities and the risk of telemedicine deepening the healthcare divide by concentrating resources in urban centers.\", \"Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in underserved regions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine can address healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap in rural communities with limited access to specialized care.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine can be part of the solution by providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, making these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals\\\\\", \\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"Cost savings for patients and improved chronic disease management (Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance)\\\\\", \\\\\"High patient satisfaction rates documented in multiple studies\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_1', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on healthcare professional shortages in underserved areas', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_22', 'query': 'Concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas', 'title': 'Mapping virtual care - McKinsey & Company', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/charts/mapping-virtual-care'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Telemedicine's increased adoption in urban centers creates a powerful draw for healthcare providers, exacerbating shortages in underserved areas.  McKinsey & Company found higher urban adoption rates (3_22), creating an incentive for relocation and leaving rural areas even more underserved.  This worsens existing shortages, as highlighted by the 2023 Physician Leaders study finding a 65% primary care physician deficit in rural areas (3_1).  Thus, telemedicine concentrates resources, worsening the urban-rural healthcare divide.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can create a digital divide in healthcare, exacerbating disparities between those with access to technology and those without.\", \"argument\": [\"The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms.\", \"CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals, creating a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine does not create disparities; it highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows that telemedicine itself doesn\\'t create disparities\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine expands access to mental health services in underserved areas (Mental Health Journal)\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Lack of digital literacy is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_5', 'query': 'Digital divide in healthcare and telemedicine', 'title': \"The Digital Divide in Healthcare: It's Not Just Access\", 'url': 'https://gkc.himss.org/resources/digital-divide-healthcare-its-not-just-access'}, {'id': '8_21', 'query': 'Telemedicine access barriers for low-income individuals', 'title': \"Telehealth's Impact on Health Equity: Evidence Roundup\", 'url': 'https://www.chcs.org/resource/telehealths-impact-on-health-equity-evidence-roundup/'}, {'id': '8_22', 'query': 'Telemedicine access barriers for low-income individuals', 'title': 'Telemedicine Health Disparities in the Black Community', 'url': 'https://telehealth.org/telemedicine-health-disparities-in-the-black-community/'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Telemedicine exacerbates existing societal inequalities by creating a digital divide in healthcare access.  Low-income individuals often lack reliable internet and devices, hindering their ability to utilize telemedicine.  Furthermore, many lack the digital literacy skills to navigate complex platforms (GKC HIMSS Resource).  This effectively excludes them from this mode of care, worsening existing disparities (CHCS, Telehealth.org).\n\n\n### Action: Defend Logic\n**Our Logic Chain to be defended**: [('{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas by concentrating providers in urban centers.\", \"argument\": [\"McKinsey & Company\\'s research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, creating a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.\", \"Physician Leaders\\' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities and the risk of telemedicine deepening the healthcare divide by concentrating resources in urban centers.\", \"Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in underserved regions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine can address healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap in rural communities with limited access to specialized care.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine can be part of the solution by providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, making these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals\\\\\", \\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"Cost savings for patients and improved chronic disease management (Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance)\\\\\", \\\\\"High patient satisfaction rates documented in multiple studies\\\\\"]}\"]}', '{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can create a digital divide in healthcare, exacerbating disparities between those with access to technology and those without.\", \"argument\": [\"The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms.\", \"CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals, creating a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine does not create disparities; it highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows that telemedicine itself doesn\\'t create disparities\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine expands access to mental health services in underserved areas (Mental Health Journal)\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Lack of digital literacy is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\"]}\"]}')]\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_11', 'query': 'Does telemedicine worsen the healthcare provider shortage in rural areas?', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_22', 'query': 'Concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas', 'title': 'Mapping virtual care - McKinsey & Company', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/charts/mapping-virtual-care'}]\n**Short Argument**: Telemedicine exacerbates healthcare disparities.

        "statements": "Friends, judges, colleagues, the proponents argue that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities.  However, this argument ignores the crucial ways it actively exacerbates them. They cite the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, suggesting telemedicine doesn't create disparities.  However, UCLA Health research reveals that underserved populations, already facing barriers to in-person care like needing unpaid time off, are further disadvantaged by the technological requirements of telemedicine (1).  This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating a new barrier to access.  Consider this: you already struggle to get to a doctor's appointment due to work constraints.  Now, you also need reliable internet and a device, effectively doubling the hurdles you face.  This is not equitable healthcare. Furthermore, the proponents mention expanding access to mental health services. While laudable, ScienceDirect research validates that lower education and income correlate with lower digital literacy, meaning many can't effectively use tele-platforms even if provided (2). This isn\u2019t just highlighting a problem; it\u2019s widening the digital divide and creating new disparities.\n\nThe proponents' claim that telemedicine addresses healthcare worker shortages is equally flawed.  They cite the HHS, stating telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations. However, this shifts the burden, exacerbating burnout among urban providers without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Physician Leaders found a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3).  Imagine you're an urban physician already stretched thin. Now, you\u2019re expected to cover vast rural populations remotely, increasing your workload without addressing the root problem.  This is unsustainable. Telemedicine, in this context, isn\u2019t a solution; it\u2019s a band-aid that masks the deeper issue of unequal resource distribution. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscores this, showing pervasive digital literacy gaps that hinder telemedicine's efficacy in underserved populations (4).\n\nOur argument isn't against telemedicine's potential; it's against its current implementation.  Expanding telemedicine without addressing the digital divide and rural healthcare worker shortages will only worsen inequalities. They mention cost savings and improved chronic disease management, citing Patient Preference and Adherence and NCQA.  However, these benefits are inaccessible to those lacking devices, internet, or the skills to use them.  What\u2019s the point of cost savings if you can\u2019t even access the service? Imagine being chronically ill in a rural area, lacking a local specialist and struggling to use telemedicine due to low digital literacy.  Telemedicine, in this case, is not a solution. They highlight high patient satisfaction rates, but whose satisfaction are we measuring? Likely those who already have access and the skills to navigate the system. This ignores the marginalized, further entrenching existing inequalities.  \n\nThe proponents suggest targeted digital literacy programs can address this.  However, these programs are often underfunded and inaccessible to those who need them most.  Furthermore, simply providing technology doesn\u2019t magically erase the complex socioeconomic factors contributing to healthcare disparities. McKinsey & Company\u2019s research shows higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, further incentivizing provider relocation and worsening rural shortages (5). This isn't bridging the gap; it's widening it. Thus, increasing telemedicine usage without simultaneously addressing the underlying issues of access, digital literacy, and healthcare worker distribution will only deepen the healthcare divide. We urge you to oppose this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/making-telemedicine-more-accessible-to-vulnerable-underserved-populations\n\n[2] Van Deursen, A. J.

Keywords: Chronic Cardiovascular Disease, Hypertension, Telemedicine This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). The traditional provider office visit for evaluation and management of chronic diseases has been the hallmark of medical care for well over a century. House calls, with all of their advantages, are now a revered relic of bygone days, making only a token resurgence in certain areas such as geriatric and family medicine. In most areas, house calls are economically infeasible, given the pressures to move patients through the outpatient offices quickly and efficiently. In this system, a busy practitioner rushes from room to room for 15\u00a0min encounters that often fail to address the needs of the patient. While this formula may maximize revenue, it has failed woefully in a much more important statistic: health outcomes. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many providers to move quickly to Telemedicine, including visits by phone and video, thus avoiding disruption in patient care. With this abrupt necessity came the opportunity to address many of the weaknesses of the classic office visit \u2013 most notably the reality that many patients\u2019 chronic diseases are not well controlled and that only 50%",

Using a qualitative research approach, the study examines how telemedicine has transformed the management of chronic conditions, especially for patients facing geographical or mobility barriers. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with patients, healthcare providers, and policy experts to gain insights into the experiences and challenges associated with telemedicine for chronic care. The findings reveal that telemedicine has improved patient accessibility to healthcare services, enabling consistent monitoring and timely interventions, which positively impact patient health outcomes. However, the study also identifies challenges, including technological barriers and limitations in patient-provider communication, that may affect care quality and patient satisfaction. Despite these issues, telemedicine is seen as a valuable supplement to traditional healthcare, enhancing healthcare access, especially for underserved populations. This research provides key insights for healthcare policymakers and practitioners in improving telemedicine practices, ensuring that they address accessibility gaps without compromising quality. The study concludes that, with strategic improvements, telemedicine holds significant potential to transform chronic disease management and make healthcare more equitable.

So far, the studies show varying results. Less attention has been paid to systemic factors, such as the context, implementation, and mechanisms of these interventions. Methods This study evaluates the experiences of patients and health personnel enrolled in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine-based follow-up of chronic conditions with usual care. Patients in the intervention group received an individual treatment plan together with computer tablets and home telemonitoring devices to report point-of-care measurements, e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose or oxygen saturation, and to respond to health related questions reported to a follow-up service. In response to abnormal measurement results, a follow-up service nurse would contact the patient and consider relevant actions. We conducted 49 interviews with patients and 77 interviews with health personnel and managers at the local centers. The interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis and based on recommendations for conducting process evaluation, considering three core aspects within the process of delivering a complex intervention: (1) context, (2) implementation, and (3) mechanisms of impact. Results Patients were mainly satisfied with the telemedicine-based service, and experienced increased safety and understanding of their symptoms and illness. Implementation of the service does, however, require dedicated resources over time. S",

Using a qualitative research approach, the study examines how telemedicine has transformed the management of chronic conditions, especially for patients facing geographical or mobility barriers. Data were collected through in-depth interviews with patients, healthcare providers, and policy experts to gain insights into the experiences and challenges associated with telemedicine for chronic care. The findings reveal that telemedicine has improved patient accessibility to healthcare services, enabling consistent monitoring and timely interventions, which positively impact patient health outcomes. However, the study also identifies challenges, including technological barriers and limitations in patient-provider communication, that may affect care quality and patient satisfaction. Despite these issues, telemedicine is seen as a valuable supplement to traditional healthcare, enhancing healthcare access, especially for underserved populations. This research provides key insights for healthcare policymakers and practitioners in improving telemedicine practices, ensuring that they address accessibility gaps without compromising quality. The study concludes that, with strategic improvements, telemedicine holds significant potential to transform chronic disease management and make healthcare more equitable.

Methods A review of systematic reviews of telemedicine interventions was conducted. Interventions included all e-health interventions, information and communication technologies for communication in health care, Internet based interventions for diagnosis and treatments, and social care if important part of health care and in collaboration with health care for patients with chronic conditions were considered relevant. Each potentially relevant systematic review was assessed in full text by one member of an external expert team, using a revised check list from EPOC (Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Group) to assess quality. Qualitative analysis of the included reviews was informed by principles of realist review. Results In total 1593 titles/abstracts were identified. Following quality assessment, the review included 80 heterogeneous systematic reviews. Twenty-one reviews concluded that telemedicine is effective, 18 found that evidence is promising but incomplete and others that evidence is limited and inconsistent. Emerging themes are the particularly problematic nature of economic analyses of telemedicine, the benefits of telemedicine for patients, and telemedicine as complex and ongoing collaborative achievements in unpredictable processes.

Abstract Objective The study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of a personalised telehealth intervention to manage chronic disease in the long run. Method The Personalised Health Care (PHC) pilot study was a randomised trial with an economic evaluation alongside over 12 months. From a health service perspective, the primary analysis compared the costs and effectiveness of PHC telehealth monitoring with usual care. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated based on costs and health-related quality of life. The PHC intervention was implemented in the Barwon Health region, Geelong, Australia, for patients with a diagnosis of COPD and/or diabetes who had a high likelihood of hospital readmission over 12 months. Results When compared to usual care at 12 months, the PHC intervention cost AUD$714 extra per patient (95%CI -4879; 6308) with a significant improvement of 0.09 in health-related quality of life (95%CI: 0.05; 0.14).

This study compares the effect of synchronous telemedicine versus in-person primary care visits on patient clinical outcomes. Methods A systematic review of studies published in PubMed and Web of Science between 1996 and January 2021 was performed using keywords related to telemedicine, diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Included studies compared synchronous telemedicine versus in-person visits with a primary care clinician, and examined outcomes of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, and/or lipid levels. Results Of 1724 citations screened, 7 publications met our inclusion criteria. Included studies were published between 2000 and 2018. Three studies were conducted in the United States, 2 in Spain, 1 in Sweden, and 1 in the United Kingdom. The telemedicine interventions investigated were multifaceted. All included synchronous visits with a primary care provider through videoconferencing and/or telephone, combined with other components such as asynchronous patient data transmission. Five studies reported on HbA1c changes, 5 on blood pressure changes, and 3 on changes in lipid levels. Compared to usual care with in-person visits, telemedicine was associated with greater reductions in HbA1c at 6\u2009months and similar HbA1c outcomes at 12\u2009months. Telemedicine conferred no significant differences in blood pressure and lipid levels compared to in-person clinic visits. Conclusions A systematic review of the literature found few studies comparing clinical outcomes resulting from synchronous telemedicine versus in-person office visit",

Telemedicine enables patients to access healthcare providers through video, phone, or messaging, offering convenience and accessibility. Meanwhile, traditional in-person care remains indispensable for physical examinations, diagnostic procedures, and emergency treatments. This article explores the advantages and ideal use cases of telemedicine and in-person care. We draw on insights from two recent studies examining medical outcomes and patient experiences with both models. By analyzing this data, we show the distinct benefits of each approach to help patients and providers make informed decisions about care delivery in the evolving healthcare landscape. Telemedicine vs. In Person: Navigating the Future of Healthcare Telemedicine is a virtual and digital approach to healthcare that allows patients to connect with their healthcare providers remotely. Telehealth appointments rose greatly during the COVID-19 pandemic when social distancing measures made in-person visits challenging.\u00a0 Telemedicine continues to be a popular alternative to traditional healthcare for some of the following reasons.\u00a0 The Traditional Approach While telemedicine use has grown, in person care remains the cornerstone of healthcare delivery. When comparing telemedicine vs. in person visits, traditional in person visits offer some benefits that telemedicine can\u2019t entirely replicate.\u00a0 Study 1: Telemedicine vs. In Person: What the Study Reveals A comprehensive study conducted by the Kaiser Permanente research division provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of telemedicine vs. in person care.

Driven by technological advancements and the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine adoption soared, redefining how care is delivered. But how does telemedicine stack up against traditional in-person visits, and what does the future hold for both? The Growth of Telemedicine Telemedicine involves the remote delivery of healthcare services through technology such as video calls, phone consultations, or mobile apps.\r According to a study by McKinsey & Company, telehealth utilization increased 38-fold from pre-pandemic levels in 2020, with 17% of outpatient and office visits conducted virtually. This trend has continued, albeit at a moderated pace, highlighting its growing acceptance among patients and providers. The Pros of Telemedicine One of the most significant advantages of telemedicine is its ability to overcome geographic and logistical barriers. Patients in remote or underserved areas can access specialists without traveling long distances, enhancing healthcare equity. A 2023 report by the American Medical Association underscored telehealth\u2019s role in closing healthcare gaps, particularly for rural populations.\r Additionally, telemedicine saves time and costs for both patients and healthcare systems. The Journal of Medical Internet Research noted that telehealth could save patients up to $50 per visit while significantly reducing no-show rates. Telemedicine also fosters continuity of care, especially for chronic disease management and mental health services. By enabling regular follow-ups and real-time monitoring through wearable devices or apps, it enhances patient adherence to treatment regimens. Research published in Nature Digital Medicine has shown that digital engagement via telehealth platforms can lead to better health outcomes.\r Furthermore,",

Abstract Chronic diseases disproportionately affect patients in low-income minority groups who traditionally use in-person healthcare services. COVID-19 disrupted their routines and limited options for people to receive care; this could exacerbate health inequities. The study examined telehealth chronic disease management among low-income minority groups. We used Florida Medicaid claims data from March to December 2020 and the American Consumer Survey to examine the study objectives. Data were analyzed using Linear and Logistic Regression. We retrieved claim records of 52,904 unique patients; 31,999 were female and 49% of the sample had at least one telehealth visit. Medicaid patients were 8% less likely to use telehealth and 21% more likely to have audio visits when compared to Medicare patients. The analyses suggest that Non-Hispanic Black patients and individuals with a lack of education experience significant health inequities. People with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (5%) and heart failure (14%) were less likely to use telehealth than patients with diabetes. Telehealth will continue to be a health deliver",

So far, the studies show varying results. Less attention has been paid to systemic factors, such as the context, implementation, and mechanisms of these interventions. Methods This study evaluates the experiences of patients and health personnel enrolled in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine-based follow-up of chronic conditions with usual care. Patients in the intervention group received an individual treatment plan together with computer tablets and home telemonitoring devices to report point-of-care measurements, e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose or oxygen saturation, and to respond to health related questions reported to a follow-up service. In response to abnormal measurement results, a follow-up service nurse would contact the patient and consider relevant actions. We conducted 49 interviews with patients and 77 interviews with health personnel and managers at the local centers. The interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis and based on recommendations for conducting process evaluation, considering three core aspects within the process of delivering a complex intervention: (1) context, (2) implementation, and (3) mechanisms of impact. Results Patients were mainly satisfied with the telemedicine-based service, and experienced increased safety and understanding of their symptoms and illness. Implementation of the service does, however, require dedicated resources over time. S",

Just about 7 chronic diseases, namely \u2013 diabetes, cancer, hypertension, heart disease, pulmonary conditions, stroke, and mental illness \u2013 have a total impact on the US economy of close to $1.3 trillion annually. As these disorders continue to overwhelm healthcare systems across the globe, providers are now looking at ways they can ameliorate chronic disease management, without negatively impacting the quality of care being delivered.\u00a0 Telemedicine has emerged as an effective solution on this front. Physicians and specialists can use mobile devices, live audio and video, mHealth apps, and other smart digital tools to monitor a patient\u2019s condition from a distance and at any given point in time.\u00a0 In this piece, we will be looking at three ways telemedicine is transforming the chronic disease management landscape and improving outcomes for patients suffering through these diseases. Telemedicine Consults for Increased Access to Specialized Care According to one recent report published by the Pew Research Center, close to 46 million Americans currently reside in the nation\u2019s rural regions. This implies that many patients across the United States lack access to healthcare facilities and have to cover long distances just to be able to see their primary care provider or a specialist. Additionally, patients with chronic conditions greatly rely on specialist care when trying to cure their symptoms, which can be difficult to receive in some parts of the country, making it more arduous for them to consult their healthcare provider on a regular basis.

Many physicians and patients were hesitant to adopt telemedicine at first. However, the pandemic led to a forced change in healthcare delivery in order to limit the spread of the virus. Since then, providers, patients and healthcare leaders alike have witnessed telehealth and virtual care delivery filling the gaps left by an outdated healthcare system. This blog post will cover which of those areas of practice have seen the most success after adopting telemedicine. Telemedicine adoption The use of telemedicine requires physicians, subsidiary staff and healthcare organizations to adapt to ensure quality and cost-effective care. Advances in technology such as computers, cellphones and other mobile devices enabled healthcare professionals the ability to virtually monitor and treat patients. The use of telemedicine is not intended to replace traditional in-person treatment, but to work in partnership with it. Virtual care offers clinicians a platform where they can meet the patient where they are without ever having to travel themselves. It improves overall quality of medical care by saving resources, reducing costs for patients and providers and improving workflow. Since the pandemic, telemedicine has successfully been adopted in a variety of specialties and areas of practice such as endocrinology, gastroenterology, psychiatric care and military care. 1.

Such whopping numbers show that people do realize the benefits of telehealth and the potential that this industry carries as a whole. In this post, we'll examine five innovative telemedicine app examples as well as take a look at some other components of telehealth and telemedicine to understand what is currently trending in this niche and why. What is Telehealth and Telemedicine Even though these two terms look similar, they aren't quite the same. Let's look at what telehealth and telemedicine mean. Telehealth \u2014 a form of E-health that combines all technologies and tools used for the delivery and improvement of medical services or systems. Compared to telemedicine, telehealth covers the broader spectrum of devices and technologies used in healthcare. Telemedicine \u2014 a subcategory of telehealth that focuses only on the delivery of medical services (or education) over a distance. In other words, telemedicine deals solely with remote devices, wearables, etc. while telehealth works with medical information and improvement of the daily work of healthcare professionals in general. Now we've figured out the differences between these two concepts, let's see which technologies are normally used for the creation of telehealth products. What Are Telehealth Technology Examples Used in App Development Big Data As it is with any other industry, in healthcare the ability to correctly gather and process data and derive the necessary conclusions from it meanseverything. The collection of big data allows physicians to make more informed decisions regarding treatment, thus reducing the risk of human error.

Breadcrumb Telehealth for chronic conditions In this guide Breadcrumb Managing chronic conditions through telehealth Telehealth treatment options are vast, but they vary depending on the condition and the patient\u2019s needs and abilities. On this page: There are some instances where patients will need in-person office appointments. Examples include: Improvements to technology mean there are a lot more options for telehealth care that will benefit both patients and their providers. Patients are more likely to follow their treatment and management plan with routine telehealth follow ups, which gives providers a better look at the patient\u2019s health and well-being. More frequent check-ins through telehealth, and the possibility of remote patient monitoring, also can help providers catch any complications faster. That could lead to fewer hospitalizations and emergency room visits. Creating a plan for emergency care\u00a0is necessary when treating chronically ill patients with telehealth. You may notice that your patient\u2019s remote monitoring devices are picking up alarming data, or that the symptoms they are describing sound like a life-threatening event.

Abstract A literature review was conducted to obtain a high-level view of the value of telemedicine in the management of five common chronic diseases (asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension). A total of 141 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was identified, in which 148 telemedicine interventions of various kinds had been tested in a total of 37,695 patients. The value of each intervention was categorised in terms of the outcomes specified by the investigators in that trial, i.e. no attempt was made to extract a common outcome from all studies, as would be required for a conventional meta-analysis. Summarizing the value of these interventions shows, first, that most studies have reported positive effects (n = 108), and almost none have reported negative effects (n = 2). This suggests publication bias. Second, there were no significant differences between the chronic diseases, i.e. telemedicine seems equally effective (or ineffective) in the diseases studied. Third, most studies have been relatively short-term (median duration 6 month",

However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization.

Abstract Background Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.

Can virtual healthcare services save costs and boost efficiency for healthcare providers? Let\u2019s explore the economic benefits of telemedicine and discover how it can revolutionize the way we deliver and access healthcare. Key Takeaways: Reduced Overhead Costs Moving to telemedicine allows healthcare providers to reduce overhead costs associated with traditional practices. With virtual consultations, there is no need for physical office space, eliminating expenses such as office maintenance, supplies, and rental furniture. Telemedicine platforms provide all necessary services, allowing practitioners to access their virtual office from any device. This eliminates the need for physical office equipment, reducing virtual office expenses significantly. With a virtual office, healthcare providers can streamline their operations and allocate resources more efficiently. By adopting telemedicine, practitioners can significantly reduce their operational costs and allocate resources more efficiently. Transitioning to a remote healthcare operations model through telemedicine minimizes the financial burden of maintaining a physical clinic. Healthcare providers can redirect the funds saved from reduced overhead costs to other critical areas, such as improving patient care, investing in advanced technology, or expanding their telemedicine services. Reducing Overhead Costs: A Comparative Analysis The table above highlights the cost-saving advantages of telemedicine regarding overhead expenses. By embracing virtual healthcare, providers can experience substantial reductions in operational costs, ensuring financial stability while delivering high-quality care. Reduced Travel Expenses Telemedicine offers healthcare practitioners a solution to reduce travel expenses, thanks to the convenience ",

In fact, a recent study showed that 51 percent of working-age Americans struggle to afford their health care. It is important that patients have the tools needed to access affordable care and cost-savings where possible. Telehealth can often provide these vital cost-saving opportunities and is crucial in lowering care costs for both patients and providers, while increasing access to quality care. During the COVID-19 pandemic between January 2020 and February 2021, the average telehealth users\u2019 monthly health care expenses fell from $1,099 to $425, or a 61% decrease in care expenses. This means that patients are saving up to $121 each visit \u2013 with climbing rates of inflation and an unstable economy, these savings can be a lifeline for Americans. One of the most compelling reasons for telehealth is its convenience for patients, which can impact travel burdens that create barriers to care in accessing transportation, taking time off from work and finding childcare. Medicare beneficiaries especially rely on the health care savings they see via telehealth and the convenience it provides. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimate that telemedicine saves Medicare patients $60 million on travel, with a projected estimate of $100 million by 2024 and $170 million by 2029. CMS also noted that estimates tend to underestimate telemedicine\u2019s impact, higher projections estimate closer to $540 million in savings by 2029.

For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

In this study, we explore the costs and benefits of one large telehealth EMS initiative. Methods Using a case-control study design and both micro- and gross-costing data from the Houston Fire Department EMS electronic patient care record system, we conducted a cost-benefit analysis (CBA) comparing costs with potential savings associated with patients treated through a telehealth-enabled intervention. The intervention consisted of telehealth-based consultation between the 911 patient and an EMS physician, to evaluate and triage the necessity for patient transport to a hospital emergency department (ED). Patients with non-urgent, primary care-related conditions were then scheduled and transported by alternative means to an affiliated primary care clinic. We measured CBA as both total cost savings and cost per ED visit averted, in US Dollars ($USD). Results In total, 5570 patients were treated over the first full 12 months with a telehealth-enabled care model. We found a 6.7% absolute reduction in potentially medically unnecessary ED visits, and a 44-minute reduction in total ambulance ",

Even though tracking the actual ROI and impact is challenging, the benefits of telehealth are tangible right after its adoption. It reduces patient costs and brings many advantages that indirectly optimize expenses, such as serving more patients in less time. Besides, telehealth services receive strong governmental support in many countries, including the US. In the last 5 years, 18 states passed laws to add audio-only telehealth coverage to health plans. Moreover, since 2020, Medicare has started covering more telehealth services, some of which at a lower rate.\u00a0 What does it have to do with the cost? In fact, a lot.\u00a0 These initiatives stimulate the broader provision of telehealth and its accessibility for patients. It becomes a cost-effective solution for physicians and providers to treat patients and arrange their workflows. Read more about telemedicine costs and benefits below.

However, there is another side to it. The USA is a leader among the countries in terms of healthcare spending per person. In 2022, healthcare spending in the US almost reached $4.5 trillion, averaging $13,493 per person. This accounted for 17.3% of the country\u2019s GDP. By comparison, other wealthy nations spend significantly less per capita on healthcare. For instance, health expenditures per person in comparable high-income countries averaged about $6,651, making US spending more than twice as high as the average of these countries.

A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately.

While the convenience and accessibility of virtual consultations have been widely celebrated, another crucial aspect of telemedicine is its cost-effectiveness. In 2024, the economic benefits of telemedicine are becoming increasingly apparent, offering significant savings for both patients and healthcare providers. Let's delve into how telemedicine is reshaping the financial landscape of healthcare. For Patients: A Financial Lifesaver 1. Reduced Travel Expenses One of the most immediate and tangible benefits of telemedicine for patients is the elimination of travel costs. Whether it's the expense of gas, parking fees, or public transportation fares, traveling to and from medical appointments can add up quickly. Telemedicine allows patients to consult with their healthcare providers from the comfort of their homes, saving both time and money. 2. Lower Medical Bills Telemedicine can also lead to lower medical bills. Virtual visits typically cost less than in-person visits, partly due to reduced overhead costs for healthcare facilities. Additionally, patients can avoid emergency room visits or urgent care centers for non-emergency issues, opting instead for a more cost-effective virtual consultation. 3. Increased Access to Preventive Care Preventive care is essential for maintaining long-term health and preventing costly medical conditions. Telemedicine makes it easier for patients to access preventive services, such as routine check-ups, screenings, and vaccinations. By catching health issues early, patients can avoid more expensive treatments down the line. 4. Time Savings Time is money, and telemedicine saves patients considerable time.

This practice has been around almost as long as telephones but has become more popular and practical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in technology and changes to insurance reimbursement rulings have helped increase the acceptance of telemedicine. Without it, doctors and therapists wouldn\u2019t be able to connect with patients as easily, especially during the pandemic. As telemedicine has become widespread, professionals and patients have grown more comfortable connecting virtually. Benefits Telemedicine isn\u2019t meant to take the place of face-to-face visits. While it does have some disadvantages, which we\u2019ll get into later, its benefits are undeniable. They include: 1. Easy access to specialists Not everyone has an ongoing relationship with a doctor they can call when they need one. Many online medical networks offer round-the-clock access to all kinds of specialists, without an appointment, at any time of day or night. 2. Lower cost Doctors and therapists can be expensive, even for people with good health insurance. Telemedicine appointments typically cost less than in-person visits do. This reduces out-of-pocket costs, removing a barrier to care. 3. Medical access for people without health insurance Not having adequate health insurance can be an obstacle to seeing a doctor. Many online companies provide cash-pay telemedicine, which doesn\u2019t require health insurance or referrals. 4. Medical access for people in rural areas Country living has many benefits, but fast access to medical c",

Can virtual healthcare services save costs and boost efficiency for healthcare providers? Let\u2019s explore the economic benefits of telemedicine and discover how it can revolutionize the way we deliver and access healthcare. Key Takeaways: Reduced Overhead Costs Moving to telemedicine allows healthcare providers to reduce overhead costs associated with traditional practices. With virtual consultations, there is no need for physical office space, eliminating expenses such as office maintenance, supplies, and rental furniture. Telemedicine platforms provide all necessary services, allowing practitioners to access their virtual office from any device. This eliminates the need for physical office equipment, reducing virtual office expenses significantly. With a virtual office, healthcare providers can streamline their operations and allocate resources more efficiently. By adopting telemedicine, practitioners can significantly reduce their operational costs and allocate resources more efficiently. Transitioning to a remote healthcare operations model through telemedicine minimizes the financial burden of maintaining a physical clinic. Healthcare providers can redirect the funds saved from reduced overhead costs to other critical areas, such as improving patient care, investing in advanced technology, or expanding their telemedicine services. Reducing Overhead Costs: A Comparative Analysis The table above highlights the cost-saving advantages of telemedicine regarding overhead expenses. By embracing virtual healthcare, providers can experience substantial reductions in operational costs, ensuring financial stability while delivering high-quality care.

Abstract Background Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.

Evaluating the ROI of telemedicine goes beyond just comparing dollar figures. It mandates a comprehensive understanding of both tangible and intangible returns. Tangible returns can be direct financial gains or savings, like lower facility expenses or more patients seen. Intangible returns might include: enhanced patient satisfaction; better access to healthcare in remote areas; a more adaptable healthcare system. Moreover, the time frame for assessing telemedicine ROI may differ from traditional investments. Given the rapid pace of tech advancements",

Since January 2020 Elsevier has created a COVID-19 resource centre with free information in English and Mandarin on the novel coronavirus COVID-19. The COVID-19 resource centre is hosted on Elsevier Connect, the company's public news and information website. Elsevier hereby grants permission to make all its COVID-19-related research that is available on the COVID-19 resource centre - including this research content - immediately available in PubMed Central and other publicly funded repositories, such as the WHO COVID database with rights for unrestricted research re-use and analyses in any form or by any means with acknowledgement of the original source. These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre remains active. Abstract Telemedicine was underused and understudied until the COVID-19 pandemic, during which reduced regulations and increased payment parity facilitated a rapid increase in telemedicine consultation. Telemedicine literature to date suggests that it holds benefits for patients and health care providers, may result in outcomes not inferior to in-person care, and has cost-saving implications. Future research should investigate which conditions are best suited to assess and treat via telemedicine (including physical exam elements), what techniques improve telemedicine communication, how to help patients equitably access telemedicine, and how to best educate the future health care workforce.

Even though tracking the actual ROI and impact is challenging, the benefits of telehealth are tangible right after its adoption. It reduces patient costs and brings many advantages that indirectly optimize expenses, such as serving more patients in less time. Besides, telehealth services receive strong governmental support in many countries, including the US. In the last 5 years, 18 states passed laws to add audio-only telehealth coverage to health plans. Moreover, since 2020, Medicare has started covering more telehealth services, some of which at a lower rate.\u00a0 What does it have to do with the cost? In fact, a lot.\u00a0 These initiatives stimulate the broader provision of telehealth and its accessibility for patients. It becomes a cost-effective solution for physicians and providers to treat patients and arrange their workflows. Read more about telemedicine costs and benefits below. Healthcare Expenses Overview and Why are Telehealth Cost Savings So Important Telehealth software development is showing consistent, year-over-year growth. Think of it, in 2027, it\u2019s expected to reach $559,52 billion in the USA. As federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid increases, new opportunities for healthcare businesses also emerge. However, there is another side to it. The USA is a leader among the countries in terms of healthcare spending per person. In 2022, healthcare spending in the US almost reached $4.5 trillion, averaging $13,493 per person. This accounted for 17.3% of the country\u2019s GDP. By comparison, other wealthy nations spend significantly less per capita on healthcare. For instance, health expenditures per person in comparable high-income countries averaged about $6,651, making US spending more than twice as high as the average of these countries.

The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services. Objective: This study aims to investigate if telehealth reduces health system costs compared with traditional service models and to identify the scenarios in which cost savings can be realized. Methods: A scoping review was undertaken to meet the study aims. Initially, literature searches were conducted using broad terms for telehealth and economics to identify economic evaluation literature in telehealth. The investigators then conducted an expert focus group to identify domains where telehealth could reduce health system costs, followed by targeted literature searches for corresponding evidence. Results: The cost analyses reviewed provided evide",

Abstract Background Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring have emerged as transformative solutions in contemporary healthcare. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of these technologies on healthcare delivery, focusing on patient outcomes, economic parameters, and overall satisfaction. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in various healthcare facilities, involving 186 participants with chronic diseases. Inclusion criteria included patients actively using telemedicine services. Data collection methods included surveys, interviews, and review of medical records, focusing on patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and economic parameters. The intervention involved a seamless integration of telemedicine technologies into the existing health system. Results Primary outcomes revealed significant improvements in patient health, including a decrease in disease-specific markers (mean reduction of 12,000 to 11,000, p = 0.00",

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

To inform the ongoing debate about whether to continue payment for telemedicine visits, we estimated the association of greater telemedicine use across health systems with utilization, spending, and quality. In 2020, Medicare patients receiving care at health systems in the highest quartile of telemedicine use had 2.5 telemedicine visits per person (26.8 percent of visits) compared with 0.7 telemedicine visits per person (9.5 percent of visits) in the lowest quartile of telemedicine use. In 2021-22, relative to those in the lowest quartile, Medicare patients of health systems in the highest quartile had an increase of 0.21 total outpatient visits (telemedicine and in-person) per patient per year (2.2 percent relative increase), a decrease of 14.4 annual non-COVID-19 emergency department visits per 1,000 patients per year (2.7 percent relative decrease), a $248 increase in per patient per year spending (1.6 percent relative increase), and increased adherence for metformin and statins. There were no clear differential changes in hospitalizations or receipt of preventive care. PubMed Disclaime",

Yet, while the need for telehealth becomes more pressing, the cost of telehealth implementation for healthcare providers includes many hidden charges and must be carefully estimated before adoption. Is your cost for implementing and maintaining telehealth solutions within a reasonable range? And, more importantly, do the benefits outweigh the costs? If you have doubts, you\u2019ve come to the right place!\u00a0 In this blog post, we will share our in-depth insights into the cost of telehealth system development. We\u2019ll break down the factors impacting the price, provide a market overview, and explain how the benefits of investing in telemedicine justify the costs. Why You Should View Telemedicine System As an Opportunity The telemedicine market was significantly reshaped by COVID-19. Even though we are out of the pandemic, providers are now considering telehealth systems more seriously than ever before, primarily for the reasons below. The pandemic has underscored the need for remote healthcare solutions. Telemedicine systems mitigate the risk of virus transmission by reducing physical visits and ensure continued care during such unprecedented crises. In fact, during the height of the pandemic, NYU Langone, located at the heart of the U.S. outbreak, had approximately 7,000 video visits daily. In April alone, they recorded around 100,000 video visits, a stark contrast to the pre-pandemic average of about 300 visits per day. Telehealth enables patients to remotely communicate with their healthcare providers, eliminating the necessity for travel and decreasing the time spent waiting. A recent study shows that 83% of patients who engaged in a telemedicine visit in the previous year are willing to keep and increase their use of telemedicine in the future. Additionally, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported i",

Home > Blog > How Much Does Telemedicine Cost? December 27, 2024 One of the biggest healthcare issues we face in the U.S. is the exorbitant cost of providing care. In 2019, we spent $3.8 trillion on healthcare. That is mind blowing. It amounts to almost $12,000 per person or 17.7% of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). That\u2019s a lot of Bitcoin. Of that nearly $4 trillion, 11% or $406 billion was paid directly out of our pockets. Commercial and government payers (insurance companies) covered the difference, but at what cost to us? The average cost of health care premiums has been rising steadily for years. As of 2018, premiums were approaching $20,000 per family. We are all spending WAY TOO MUCH on healthcare to be as unhealthy as we are as a country. Now enters telemedicine into the equation. Virtual house calls from the comfort of your home. But how much does telemedicine cost? Is telemedicine reimbursed by insurance? Is telemedicine less expensive than in-person care or are we just adding to this ballooning problem of healthcare spending? Fear not, we\u2019re here to help. Let\u2019s examine the costs of telemedicine and see if it\u2019s a cost effective solution. Since new telemedicine companies are popping up each day, we\u2019ll examine some of the more popular options as of 2021",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies. The design of the COVID-19 units divided the space into contaminated and clean zones and integrated a control room with audio-visual technologies to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the care being provided in the contaminated zone. The research is based on semi-structured interviews and observations of care processes that implemented a new model of inpatient telemedicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel in different COVID-19 units, including an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine unit (IMU). The study examines the impact of the diverse design layouts of the different units associated with the implementation of digital technologies for remote care on patient and staff safety.

This paper builds a stylized model to investigate a hospital\u2019s telemedicine strategy and the corresponding impacts on its operations regarding outpatient management of chronic diseases. We implement our analysis from three key concerns of the hospital in the presence of a pandemic: the differences in medical consumption and reimbursement between in-person and telemedicine modalities and the effort cost of infection reduction resulting from the pandemic. We find that in the absence of the pandemic, the hospital prefers to introduce telemedicine when the differences in medical consumption and reimbursement are both small. In the presence of the pandemic, we find that the introduction of telemedicine does not always benefit the hospital and that it is better not to introduce telemedicine in some cases since it may exacerbate the negative influence of the pandemic on the hospital\u2019s total costs. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that the hospital may set greater in-person capacity but less telemedicine capacity in response to the outbreak of the p",

Health systems worldwide have moved quickly to implement telemedicine in diverse settings to reduce infection, but little is understood about how best to connect patients who are acutely ill with nearby clinical team members, even in the next room. Objective: To inform these efforts, this paper aims to provide an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. Methods: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semistructured interviews with nurses (5/15, 33%), attending physicians (5/15, 33%), and resident physicians (5/15, 33%) on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine.

Gregory2,3\u00a0 2981 Accesses 42 Citations 3 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Purpose of Review Novel technologies, such as high-definition cameras, encryption software, electronic stethoscopes, microfluidic diagnostic systems, and widely available broadband Internet have expanded the potential for telemedicine. This narrative review presents current and future uses of telemedicine in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, stewardship, and management of infectious disease. Recent Findings Beginning in the 1990s, early approaches to telemedicine in infectious disease focused largely on treatment of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. However, recent innovations allow for targeting of additional diseases and in increasingly remote settings. Telemedicine allows virtual visits between patients in the home and remote providers, permitting outpatient management of complex conditions, such as post-surgical site monitoring, and non-urgent infectious maladies, such as uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Remote provider education by videoconference and integrated clinical decision support tools create avenues to improve inpatient care, including antimicrobial stewardship. Technological strides from miniaturization of diagnostic tests to robotic telepresence physical exams improve access to infectious disease care in isolated and infrastructure-poor environments, from cargo ships to other resource-limited settings. Summary Telemedicine in the field of infectious disease is rapidly expanding in clinical, technological, geographical, and human capacity. Recent innovati",

Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies.

Objective: To inform these efforts, this paper aims to provide an early example of inpatient telemedicine implementation and its perceived acceptability and effectiveness. Methods: Using purposive sampling, this study conducted 15 semistructured interviews with nurses (5/15, 33%), attending physicians (5/15, 33%), and resident physicians (5/15, 33%) on a single COVID-19 unit within Stanford Health Care to evaluate implementation outcomes and perceived effectiveness of inpatient telemedicine.

It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no secret that the combination of aging populations, increased burden of disease, and staffing shortages has left substantial unmet needs when it comes to acute hospital care. Resource constraints are also affecting wait times in many government-run health systems; in Australia and the United Kingdom, for example, it is commonplace for ambulances transporting patients to \u00e2\u0080\u009cramp\u00e2\u0080\u009d at hospital entrances because bedspace is at capacity. COVID-19 has compounded these challenges and, in many cases, further overwhelmed the capacity of hospitals and intensive care units worldwide.1\u00c3\u0089lie Azoulay et al., \u00e2\u0080\u009cCOVID-19: A heavy toll on health-care workers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Lancet Respiratory Medicine, March 2021, Volume 9, Number 3.

In the face of these challenges, many health providers have implemented remote patient monitoring (RPM) of COVID-19 patients in their own homes. However systematic reviews of the literature on these implementations have revealed wide variations in how RPM is implemented; along with variations in particulars of RPM reported on, making comparison and evaluation difficult. A review of reported items is warranted to develop a framework of key items to enhance reporting consistency. The aims of this review of remote monitoring for COVID-19 patients are twofold: (1) to facilitate comparison between RPM implementations by tabulating information and values under common domains. (2) to develop a reporting framework to enhance reporting consistency. Method A review of the literature for RPM for COVID-19 patients was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. The Medline database was searched for articles published between 2020 to February 2023 and studies reporting on items with sufficient detail to compare one with another were included. Relevant data was extracted and synthesized by the lead author. Quality appraisal was not conducted as the the articles considered were evaluated as informational reports of clinical implementations rather than as studies designed to answer a research question. Results From 305 studies retrieved, 23 studies were included in the review: fourteen from the US, two from the UK and one each from Africa, Ireland, China, the Netherlands, Belgium, Australia and Italy.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies. The design of the COVID-19 units divided the space into contaminated and clean zones and integrated a control room with audio-visual technologies to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the care being provided in the contaminated zone. The research is based on semi-structured interviews and observations of care processes that implemented a new model of inpatient telemedicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel in different COVID-19 units, including an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine unit (IMU). The study examines the impact of the diverse design layouts of the different units associated with the implementation of digital technologies for remote care on patient and staff safety.

This study examined whether early outpatient follow-up via telemedicine is as effective as in-person visits for reducing 30-day readmissions in patients with heart failure. Methods and Results Using electronic health records from a large health system, we included patients with heart failure living in North Carolina (N=6918) who were hospitalized between March 16, 2020 and March 14, 2021. All-cause readmission within 30 days after discharge was examined using weighted logistic regression models. Overall, 7.6% (N=526) of patients received early telemedicine follow-up, 38.8% (N=2681) received early in-person follow-up, and 53.6% (N=3711) did not receive follow-up within 14 days of discharge. Compared with patients without early follow-up, those who received early follow-up were younger, were more likely to be Medicare beneficiaries, had more comorbidities, and were less likely to live in an disadvantaged neighborhood. Relative to in-person visits, those with telemedicine follow-up were of similar age, sex, and race but ",

Summary Background The reduction of all-cause hospital readmission among heart failure (HF) patients is a national priority. Telehealth is one strategy employed to impact this sought-after patient outcome. Prior research indicates varied results on all-cause hospital readmission highlighting the need to understand telehealth processes and optimal strategies in improving patient outcomes. Objectives The purpose of this paper is to describe how one Medicare-certified home health agency launched and maintains a telehealth program intended to reduce all-cause 30-day hospital readmissions among HF patients receiving skilled home health and report its impact on patient outcomes. Methods Using the Transitional Care Model as a guide, the telehealth program employs a 4G wireless tablet-based system that collects patient vital signs (weight, heart rate, blood pressure and blood oxygenation) via wireless peripherals, and is preloaded with subjective questions related to HF and symptoms and instructional videos. Results Year one all-cause 30-day readmission rate was 19.3%. Fiscal year 2015 ended with an all-cause 30-day readmission rate of 5.2%, a reduction by 14 percentage points (a 73% relative reduction) in three years. Telehe",

For many patients, routine medical care was no longer an option, and others chose not to visit medical offices in order to minimize COVID-19 exposure. In this study, we take a comprehensive multidisease approach in studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on health care usage and the adoption of telemedicine through the first 12 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: We studied the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on in-person health care usage and telehealth adoption across chronic diseases to understand differences in telehealth adoption across disease cohorts and patient demographics (such as the Social Vulnerability Index [SVI]). Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 6 different disease cohorts (anxiety: n=67,578; depression: n=45,570; diabetes: n=81,885; kidney failure: n=29,284; heart failure: n=21,152; and cancer: n=35,460).

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

We included English-language, U.S.-healthcare relevant studies comparing telehealth with in-person care conducted after the onset of the pandemic. Two reviewers independently screened search results, serially extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias and strength of evidence. We identified 77 studies, the majority of which (47, 61%) were judged to have a serious or high risk of bias. Differences, if any, in healthcare utilization and clinical outcomes between in-person and telehealth care were generally small and/or not clinically meaningful and varied across the type of outcome and clinical area. For process outcomes, there was a mostly lower rate of missed visits and changes in therapy/medication and higher rates of therapy/medication adherence among patients receiving an initial telehealth visit compared with those receiving in-person care. However, the rates of up-to-date labs/paraclinical assessment were also lower among patients receiving an initial telehealth visit compared with those receiving in-person care. Most studies lacked a standardized approach to assessing outcomes. While we refrain from making an overall conclusion about the performance of telehealth versus in-person visits the ",

We included English-language, U.S.-healthcare relevant studies comparing telehealth with in-person care conducted after the onset of the pandemic. Two reviewers independently screened search results, serially extracted data, and independently assessed the risk of bias and strength of evidence. We identified 77 studies, the majority of which (47, 61%) were judged to have a serious or high risk of bias. Differences, if any, in healthcare utilization and clinical outcomes between in-person and telehealth care were generally small and/or not clinically meaningful and varied across the type of outcome and clinical area. For process outcomes, there was a mostly lower rate of missed visits and changes in therapy/medication and higher rates of therapy/medication adherence among patients receiving an initial telehealth visit compared with those receiving in-person care.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies. The design of the COVID-19 units divided the space into contaminated and clean zones and integrated a control room with audio-visual technologies to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the care being provided in the contaminated zone. The research is based on semi-structured interviews and observations of care processes that implemented a new model of inpatient telemedicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel in different COVID-19 units, including an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine unit (IMU). The study examines the impact of the diverse design layouts of the different units associated with the implementation of digital technologies for remote care on patient and staff safety. The results demonstrate the challenges and opportunities of int",

Abstract Introduction Telemedicine extends intensivists' reach to critically ill patients cared for by other physicians. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of telemedicine on patients' outcomes. Methods We searched electronic databases through April 2012, bibliographies of included trials, and indexes and conference proceedings in two journals (2001 to 2012). We selected controlled trials or observational studies of critically ill adults or children, examining the effects of telemedicine on mortality. Two authors independently selected studies and extracted data on outcomes (mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital) and methodologic quality. We used random-effects meta-analytic models unadjusted for case mix or cluster effects and quantified between-study heterogeneity by using I2 (the percentage of total variability across studies attributable to heterogeneity rather than to chance). Results Of 865 citations, 11 observational studies met selection criteria. Overall quality was moderate (mean score on Newcastle-Ottawa scale, 5.1/9; range, 3 to 9). Meta-analyses showed that telemedic",

Abstract Telehealth includes health care services provided using audio and video technology. Telehealth was originally developed to provide basic care to rural and underserved patients. Higher rates of use of telehealth are now standard in many practices since the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Increasing emphases on patient satisfaction, providing efficient and quality care, and minimizing costs have also led to higher telehealth implementation. Patients and providers have enjoyed the benefits of telehealth, but widespread adoption has been hindered by regulatory, legal, and reimbursement barriers. Recent legislative initiatives have advocated for further telehealth advancements, especially with the rapid implementation of telehealth in the times of coronaviru",

                  "raw_content": "17 Benefits of Telemedicine for Doctors and Patients Telemedicine is the ability of healthcare providers to meet with patients remotely via telephone or video. This practice has been around almost as long as telephones but has become more popular and practical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in technology and changes to insurance reimbursement rulings have helped increase the acceptance of telemedicine. Without it, doctors and therapists wouldn\u2019t be able to connect with patients as easily, especially during the pandemic. As telemedicine has become widespread, professionals and patients have grown more comfortable connecting virtually. Benefits Telemedicine isn\u2019t meant to take the place of face-to-face visits. While it does have some disadvantages, which we\u2019ll get into later, its benefits are undeniable. They include: 1. Easy access to specialists Not everyone has an ongoing relationship with a doctor they can call when they need one. Many online medical networks offer round-the-clock access to all kinds of specialists, without an appointment, at any time of day or night. 2. Lower cost Doctors and therapists can be expensive, even for people with good health insurance. Telemedicine appointments typically cost less than in-person visits do. This reduces out-of-pocket costs, removing a barrier to care. 3. Medical access for people without health insurance Not having adequate health insurance can be an obstacle to seeing a doctor. Many online companies provide cash-pay telemedicine, which doesn\u2019t require health insurance or referrals. 4. Medical access for people in rural areas Country living has many benefits, but fast access to medical care isn\u2019t always one of them. For people who live many miles from the nearest medical facility, telemedicine provides a way to meet with a doctor quickly. This saves time and allows people to stay off the road when driving conditions are less than optimal, such as during a snowstorm or hailstorm. 5. Medical access for people in underserved urban areas The trend of hospita",

Abstract Background Prior to the wider adoption of digital health technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic, applications of virtual care were largely limited to specialist visits and remote care using telehealth (phone or video) applications. Data sharing approaches using tethered patient portals were mostly built around hospitals and larger care systems. These portals offer opportunities for improved communication, but despite a belief that care has improved, they have so far shown few outcome improvements beyond medication adherence. Less is known about use of virtual care and related tools in the outpatient context and particularly in rural commun",

Our aim is to critique the mechanical way telemedicine is being implemented in the health sector. Methods: We present the basic ideas of empowerment and user involvement behind telemedicine, exemplifying them with a case of user resistance to telemedicine. Four logics of empowerment are employed to identify the underlying rationale in specific cases of telemedicine. The case comes from a large evaluation of new welfare technology products. The data consist mainly of written documents and an interview. Results: Telemedicine is often considered a way to increase empowerment and user involvement in healthcare. The majority of the geriatric patients in the described case refused to engage in telemedicine, preferring instead to be hospitalized. The case appeared to be driven primarily by a professional logic of empowerment. User involvement and empowerment are discussed in terms of their demands and implication for users, such as 1) intrusion on the private sphere, i.e., the home and 2) the question of the responsibility for treatment and 3) the expectation, that the capabilities and resources of patients and relatives may increase. Conclusions: Although telemedicine is acknowledged as relevant, a mechanical approach too often hampers empowerment for the patient. Some patient groups may not feel safe using telemedicine, in which case user involvement and empowerment are not possible. Journal of N",

Abstract Background Prior to the wider adoption of digital health technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic, applications of virtual care were largely limited to specialist visits and remote care using telehealth (phone or video) applications. Data sharing approaches using tethered patient portals were mostly built around hospitals and larger care systems. These portals offer opportunities for improved communication, but despite a belief that care has improved, they have so far shown few outcome improvements beyond medication adherence.

Digitalization has many facets, ranging from telehealth to social media and even new instant communication devices, each of which affect both patients' and physicians' realities. Although the benefits of developments such as telehealth and novel applications of social media to medicine are more easily perceived by all stakeholders, they still have their own hurdles and risks, such as coldness and impersonal treatment in telehealth, and misinformation on social media. The widespread digitalization of health records has greatly facilitated patient access to health information, becoming a major patient empowerment tool; however, some forms of unrestricted access, such as to test results-in particular, prior to consultations-have unclear benefits to patients with cancer and have also become a hurdle for care teams. In addition, the advent of instant messaging, which is revolutionizing personal communication in many cultures, is gradually affecting patient-physician communication and, combined with unrestricted patient access to test results, is creating new challenges for physicians.

One effective technology is remote patient monitoring, whereby patient data, such as vital signs or symptom reports, are captured from home monitoring devices and transmitted to health care professionals for review. The use of remote patient monitoring, often referred to as telehealth, has been widely adopted by health care providers, particularly home care agencies. Most agencies have invested in telehealth to facilitate the early identification of disease exacerbation, particularly for patients with chronic diseases such as heart failure and diabetes. This technology has been successfully harnessed by agencies to reduce rehospitalization rates through remote data interpretation and the provision of timely interventions. We propose that the use of telehealth by home care agencies and other health care providers be expanded to empower patients and promote disease self-management with resultant improved health care outcomes. This article describes how remote monitoring, in combination with the application of salient adult learning and cognitive behavioral theories and applied to telehealth care delivery and practice, can promote improved patient self-efficacy with disease management.

Honestly, I found it difficult at first to establish an effective rapport with patients using telehealth, especially for new patient consults. Many physicians report difficulty making the transition to virtual patient encounters. The learning curve was more than I had expected, and my first few telehealth visits seemed disengaged and sterile. Not to mention having to deal with technical problems. In response, I looked for resources about making meaningful connections with patients, despite the loss of physical presence. I also looked at how to apply the basics of patient-centered communication to this new digital platform. As it turns out, you can learn techniques to become more comfortable and improve your \u2018web-side manner.\u2019 It helps to be familiar with the equipment and technology. Although I\u2019m far from being an IT expert, I now have a better understanding of how the system works, including how to troubleshoot common problems. Doing a test run with your office staff before starting with a patient is a good idea for those of us entirely new to telehealth. You may want to have someone available during the virtual visit who can provide (or obtain) additional tech support if needed. Having alternative options to reach the patient (e.g., phone, email, text) in case something goes down also proved essential.

This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of these technologies on healthcare delivery, focusing on patient outcomes, economic parameters, and overall satisfaction. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in various healthcare facilities, involving 186 participants with chronic diseases. Inclusion criteria included patients actively using telemedicine services. Data collection methods included surveys, interviews, and review of medical records, focusing on patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and economic parameters. The intervention involved a seamless integration of telemedicine technologies into the existing health system. Results Primary outcomes revealed significant improvements in patient health, including a decrease in disease-specific markers (mean reduction of 12,000 to 11,000, p = 0.002), a substantial reduction in severity of symptoms (mean reduction from 3,500 to 2,500, p < 0.001), and a general improvement in health status (mean increase from 7,200 to 8,500, p < 0.001).

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated and expanded the adoption of telemedicine\u00a0globally. This allowed telemedicine to engage medical students in patient care and ensured continuity of care for vulnerable patients. In this review, the history of telemedicine and some of its applications in medical education were reviewed. Furthermore, we\u00a0also shed light on how\u00a0to incorporate telemedicine into several curricula and the strategies used\u00a0to include it. The article also explored how to evaluate telemedicine and the major facilitators and barriers any medical and educational institution must address when using telemedicine. At the end of the review, we explored the future promises telemedicine has for medical education.

Abstract Patient engagement (PE) is a well-known strategy introduced and implemented by pharmaceutical and medical device companies for patient compliance and adherence to treatment protocols during clinical trials and care processes. This can affect a wider range of outcomes such as the quality of treatment decisions and quality of care outcomes. Few studies have paid attention to it. The involvement of patient is one of the crucial stakeholders of health care in their treatment that makes controversial opinions about the potential outcomes of their engagement in various aspects of healthcare. This scoping review was conducted in 2022 to collect the results of PE. The search was performed in the MEDLINE and Web of Sciences databases.

Abstract This article provides an analysis of the skills that health professionals and patients employ in reaching diagnosis and decision-making in telemedicine consultations. As governmental priorities continue to emphasize patient involvement in the management of their disease, there is an increasing need to accurately capture the provider\u2013patient interactions in clinical encounters. Drawing on conversation analysis of 10 video-mediated consultations in 3 National Health Service settings in England, this study examines the interaction between patients, General Practitioner (GPs), nurses, and consultants during diagnosis and decision-making, with the aim to identify the range of skills that participants use in the process and capture the interprofessional communication and patient involvement in the diagnosis and decision-making phases of telemedicine consultations. The analysis shows that teleconsultat",

Due to the increasing possibilities of the Internet and eHealth, many initiatives that are aimed at empowering patients are delivered online. Objective Our objective was to evaluate whether Web-based interventions are effective in increasing patient empowerment compared with usual care or face-to-face interventions. Methods We performed a systematic review by searching the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO databases from January 1985 to January 2009 for relevant citations. From the 7096 unique citations retrieved from the search strategy, we included 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that met all inclusion criteria. Pairs of review authors assessed the methodological quality of the obtained studies using the Downs and Black checklist. A meta-analysis was performed on studies that measured comparable outcomes. The GRADE approach was used to determine the level of evidence for each outcome. Results In comparison with usual care or no care, Web-based interventions had a significant positive effect on empowerment measured with the Diabetes Empowerment Scale (2 studies, standardized mean difference [SMD] = 0.61, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 - 0.94]), on self-efficacy measured with disease-specific self-efficacy scales (9 studies, SMD = 0.23, 95% CI 0.12 - 0.33), and on mastery measured with the Pearlin Mastery Scale (1 study, mean difference [MD] = 2.95, 95% CI 1.66 - 4.24).

Abstract Clinicians, researchers in health services, and other experts have been investigating how to improve healthcare using advanced computer and telecommunication technology for more than 30 years. Adequate medical facilities are still lacking in many places of the world. In these kinds of situations, technology can be quite helpful in expanding healthcare access to rural locations and offering better care at a lower cost. The delivery of healthcare is changing dramatically because of telemedicine and telehealth, particularly in terms of improving access to care. This paper aims to provide an update on the history, background, applications, benefits, barriers, and challenges of these recent technologies. This review article also covers the healthcare conditions of rural as well as urban communities. Furthermore, the implications of technologies used and improvement in the health status of an individual are also discussed. During the COVID-19 epidemic, telehealth quickly gained popularity, bringing to light a number of issues. Effective primary medical networks are crucial, as the COVID-19 pandemic\u00a0highlighted the need for impro",

This study aims to investigate the role of telemedicine in the management of patients with noncommunicable diseases in primary health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A narrative review of the literature was carried out through searching the PubMed and Google Scholar databases. Results: From the initial stages of the pandemic, several scientific medical societies issued guidelines which urged citizens and health personnel to adopt digital means in the provision of regular chronic care as much as possible. The significant benefits of the telemedicine sessions partially only filled the gap of the deferred chronic care. On the other hand, many barriers need to be addressed in order to achieve an equitable and high-quality implementation of telemedicine services.

Expansion of telemedicine may be the greatest benefit of the COVID-19 pandemic Describes the benefits of telemedicine including minimizing patient, provider, and community exposure to COVID-19 and outlines strategies for expanding telehealth in the future. Rifat Latifi, MD, FACS October 1, 2020 Telemedicine has the potential to provide rapid, safe, and high-quality care, but these virtual clinical services did not take center stage until the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In fact, the pandemic may well be remembered as the rebirth of telemedicine and telehealth. Every condition that a health care professional can see in a patient physically can be seen through telepresence, if not better. The perioperative work-up and surgical decision making can be done through telemedicine, as well as postoperative visits. Although we all enjoy and value seeing our patients face-to-face, virtual interactions can be similar to physical visits, unless serious problems and complex interventions need to be done immediately and onsite. Perhaps the benefit of the COVID-19 pandemic will be the creation of a new virtual medical world. The main reason telemedicine has grown in popularity and will continue to do so in the future is due to how this technology benefits patients while simultaneously minimizing patient, provider, and community exposure to the virus. Patients are more frequently requesting telemedicine visits instead of meeting face-to-face, both for initial and follow-up visits.

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

This narrative review presents current and future uses of telemedicine in the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, stewardship, and management of infectious disease. Recent Findings Beginning in the 1990s, early approaches to telemedicine in infectious disease focused largely on treatment of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis C, and tuberculosis. However, recent innovations allow for targeting of additional diseases and in increasingly remote settings. Telemedicine allows virtual visits between patients in the home and remote providers, permitting outpatient management of complex conditions, such as post-surgical site monitoring, and non-urgent infectious maladies, such as uncomplicated urinary tract infection. Remote provider education by videoconference and integrated clinical decision support tools create avenues to improve inpatient care, including antimicrobial stewardship.

Telemedicine has emerged as a pivotal technology in healthcare, especially in the management of infectious diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic underscored its importance, transforming how healthcare is delivered and highlighting its potential in infectious disease management. This article explores current applications of telemedicine in this field and delves into future prospects. Current Applications of Telemedicine in Infectious Disease Management 1. Remote Consultations and Diagnosis Telemedicine facilitates remote consultations, enabling patients to receive expert advice without the need to visit healthcare facilities. This is particularly valuable for infectious diseases, where reducing physical contact can prevent disease transmission. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine was extensively used for initial consultations, follow-up appointments, and monitoring of mild cases. 2. Monitoring and Managing Chronic Infectious Diseases Patients with chronic infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS or hepatitis can benefit from telemedicine for regular monitoring and management. Telemedicine platforms allow for the remote monitoring of patients\u2019 health metrics, medication adherence, and side effects, improving the continuity of care and patient outcomes. 3. Public Health Surveillance Telemedicine tools are increasingly being integrated into public health surveillance systems.

The aim of this study is to review and analyse the effect of telemedicine on the management of chronic diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis using a systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods We performed a comprehensive literature search of the Web of Science, PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CNKI (Chinese database), VIP (Chinese database), WanFang (Chinese database), and SinoMed (Chinese database) databases from their inception until December 31, 2021. The retrieved literature was screened and assessed independently by two authors. We used the risk-of-bias assessment tool recommended by the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions 5.0.2 for assessing literature quality and Revman 5.3 software to conduct the meta-analysis. Results Fifteen articles were included in this study. The results of the systematic review indicated that telemedicine consultation and telemonitoring are the most commonly used intervention methods. Telemedicine is helpful for improving self-management in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.

Abstract A literature review was conducted to obtain a high-level view of the value of telemedicine in the management of five common chronic diseases (asthma, COPD, diabetes, heart failure, hypertension). A total of 141 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) was identified, in which 148 telemedicine interventions of various kinds had been tested in a total of 37,695 patients. The value of each intervention was categorised in terms of the outcomes specified by the investigators in that trial, i.e. no attempt was made to extract a common outcome from all studies, as would be required for a conventional meta-analysis. Summarizing the value of these interventions shows, first, that most studies have reported positive effects (n = 108), and almost none have reported negative effects (n = 2). This suggests publication bias. Second, there were no significant differences between the chronic diseases, i.e. telemedicine seems equally effective (or ineffective) in the diseases studied. Third, most studies have been relatively short-term (median duration 6 month",

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Recent outbreaks, such as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), have caused widespread illness, death, and socioeconomic disruptions worldwide. To cope with these diseases effectively, it is crucial to strengthen surveillance capabilities and establish rapid response systems. Aim The aim of this review is to examine the modern technologies and solutions that have the potential to enhance zoonotic disease surveillance and outbreak responses and provide valuable insights into how cutting-edge innovations could be leveraged to prevent, detect, and control emerging zoonotic disease outbreaks. Herein, we discuss advanced tools including big data analytics, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, geographic information systems, remote sensing, molecular diagnostics, point-of-care testing, telemedicine, digital contact tracing, and early warning systems. Results These technologies enable real-time monitoring, the prediction of outbreak risks, early anomaly detection, rapid diagnosis, and targeted interventions during outbreaks. When integrated through collaborative partnerships, these strategies can significantly improve the speed and effectiveness of zoonotic disease control. However, several challenges persist, particularly in resource-limited settings, such as infrastructure limitations, costs, data integration and training requirements, and ethical implementation.

As healthcare providers and patients adapted to virtual care, telemedicine became a viable alternative to in-person visits. Remote health services provide increased access to care, especially for patients in rural or underserved areas, while also offering convenience and flexibility. However, there are also disadvantages to consider, such as privacy concerns, the quality of care, and technology limitations. Below are the advantages and disadvantages of remote healthcare and how it affects both patients and healthcare providers. Written by Redaction Team October 10, 2024 Body, Personal Development Table of Contents Advantages of Remote Healthcare The use of telehealth offers numerous benefits for patients and care providers, improving access to care and enhancing patient outcomes. Here are the key advantages of telemedicine: 1. Increased Access to Care Telemedicine allows patients to receive care regardless of their geographic location, which is especially beneficial for those living in rural or underserved areas. Virtual care reduces barriers to accessing healthcare services, ensuring that more people can get the treatment they need. Rural and underserved areas \u2013 Telehealth provides remote access to healthcare for patients who may not have physical access to clinics or hospitals.

This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions.

Abstract Telehealth includes health care services provided using audio and video technology. Telehealth was originally developed to provide basic care to rural and underserved patients. Higher rates of use of telehealth are now standard in many practices since the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Increasing emphases on patient satisfaction, providing efficient and quality care, and minimizing costs have also led to higher telehealth implementation. Patients and providers have enjoyed the benefits of telehealth, but widespread adoption has been hindered by regulatory, legal, and reimbursement barriers.

This practice has been around almost as long as telephones but has become more popular and practical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in technology and changes to insurance reimbursement rulings have helped increase the acceptance of telemedicine. Without it, doctors and therapists wouldn\u2019t be able to connect with patients as easily, especially during the pandemic. As telemedicine has become widespread, professionals and patients have grown more comfortable connecting virtually. Benefits Telemedicine isn\u2019t meant to take the place of face-to-face visits. While it does have some disadvantages, which we\u2019ll get into later, its benefits are undeniable. They include: 1. Easy access to specialists Not everyone has an ongoing relationship with a doctor they can call when they need one. Many online medical networks offer round-the-clock access to all kinds of specialists, without an appointment, at any time of day or night. 2. Lower cost Doctors and therapists can be expensive, even for people with good health insurance. Telemedicine appointments typically cost less than in-person visits do. This reduces out-of-pocket costs, removing a barrier to care. 3. Medical access for people without health insurance Not having adequate health insurance can be an obstacle to seeing a doctor. Many online companies provide cash-pay telemedicine, which doesn\u2019t require health insurance or referrals. 4. Medical access for people in rural areas Country living has many benefits, but fast access to medical care isn\u2019t always one of them. For people who live many miles from the nearest medical facility, telemedicine provides a way to meet with a doctor quickly. This saves time and allows people to stay off the road when driving conditions are less than optimal, such as during a snowstorm or hailstorm. 5.

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, it has been crucial in allowing patients and doctors to interact whilst avoiding personal contact.\u00a0\u00a0 According to McKinsey, telehealth claims increased 78 times between February and April 2020.\u00a0Nearly one in three consultations took place via Telehealth\u00a0platforms\u00a0during that month.\u00a0Following this spike,\u00a0usage settled somewhat over the following months. However, even after more than six months of stabilization, the number remains 38% higher than before the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 Experts\u00a0believe that improving consumer and provider attitudes, regulatory changes, and investment\u00a0is\u00a0contributing to\u00a0the\u00a0sustained growth of the sector.\u00a0\u00a0 Despite its growing popularity, telemedicine is\u00a0facing\u00a0several\u00a0challenges.

Abstract Telemedicine, understood as the provision of health care by a health professional to a patient who is physically not in the same location as the health professional, has many actual and potential benefits. It also has some disadvantages though, including a higher risk of misdiagnosis or another unfavorable outcome of certain remotely-provided services. In principle, the regime of legal liability for medical malpractice is the same for telemedicine as for traditional physical care. The general outline of the standard of care, which includes respect for medical science, the patient's individuality and objective possibilities, is abstract and flexible enough to be used for remote care without the need for redefinition.

One of the key advantages of telemedicine is its ability to enhance accessibility and provide cost-effectiveness for patients. Firstly, telemedicine offers enhanced accessibility by breaking down geographical barriers. Patients residing in remote or underserved areas can benefit from accessing quality healthcare without the need for travel or long commutes. This is particularly crucial for individuals with limited mobility, chronic illnesses, or those living in rural regions with limited healthcare infrastructure. With telemedicine, patients can connect with healthcare professionals from the comfort of their homes, reducing the burden on transportation and accommodation costs. Secondly, telemedicine provides cost-effective solutions for patients. By eliminating the need for in-person visits or hospital stays, telemedicine significantly reduces direct medical expenses such as transportation costs and facility fees. Moreover, it can minimize indirect costs like lost wages due to time off work or childcare arrangements. Additionally, since telehealth services can be accessed using personal devices like smartphones or computers, patients save money on consultation fees and other related expenses. In conclusion, by enhancing accessibility and offering cost-effective alternatives to traditional healthcare delivery models, telemedicine has emerged as a valuable solution for patients seeking convenient and affordable care regardless of their location or financial circumstances.\u00a0 The Drawbacks Of Telemedicine: Examining The Impact On Doctor-Patient Relationship And Healthcare Provide",

Such whopping numbers show that people do realize the benefits of telehealth and the potential that this industry carries as a whole. In this post, we'll examine five innovative telemedicine app examples as well as take a look at some other components of telehealth and telemedicine to understand what is currently trending in this niche and why. What is Telehealth and Telemedicine Even though these two terms look similar, they aren't quite the same. Let's look at what telehealth and telemedicine mean. Telehealth \u2014 a form of E-health that combines all technologies and tools used for the delivery and improvement of medical services or systems. Compared to telemedicine, telehealth covers the broader spectrum of devices and technologies used in healthcare. Telemedicine \u2014 a subcategory of telehealth that focuses only on the delivery of medical services (or education) over a distance. In other words, telemedicine deals solely with remote devices, wearables, etc. while telehealth works with medical information and improvement of the daily work of healthcare professionals in general. Now we've figured out the differences between these two concepts, let's see which technologies are normally used for the creation of telehealth products. What Are Telehealth Technology Examples Used in App Development Big Data As it is with any other industry, in healthcare the ability to correctly gather and process data and derive the necessary conclusions from it meanseverything. The collection of big data allows physicians to make more informed decisions regarding treatment, thus reducing the risk of human error. Doctors can identify the early signs of a disease and start treating it at its early stages before it progresses. On a larger scale, the ability to effectively work with big data allows healthcare institutions to map ",

Many physicians and patients were hesitant to adopt telemedicine at first. However, the pandemic led to a forced change in healthcare delivery in order to limit the spread of the virus. Since then, providers, patients and healthcare leaders alike have witnessed telehealth and virtual care delivery filling the gaps left by an outdated healthcare system. This blog post will cover which of those areas of practice have seen the most success after adopting telemedicine. Telemedicine adoption The use of telemedicine requires physicians, subsidiary staff and healthcare organizations to adapt to ensure quality and cost-effective care. Advances in technology such as computers, cellphones and other mobile devices enabled healthcare professionals the ability to virtually monitor and treat patients. The use of telemedicine is not intended to replace traditional in-person treatment, but to work in partnership with it. Virtual care offers clinicians a platform where they can meet the patient where they are without ever having to travel themselves. It improves overall quality of medical care by saving resources, reducing costs for patients and providers and improving workflow. Since the pandemic, telemedicine has successfully been adopted in a variety of specialties and areas of practice such as endocrinology, gastroenterology, psychiatric care and military care. 1.

What will this new era of virtual care look like beyond the pandemic? Here are ten telehealth examples that give a glimpse into the future of healthcare delivery \u2013 showing how telehealth can not only deliver a more convenient experience to staff and patients, but also extend the reach of care to those who may have trouble accessing it. 1. Screening and engaging patients remotely before they enter a care facility Among the many examples of telehealth that were propelled by necessity during the pandemic, one that is likely to endure is online patient screening and engagement \u2013 even before the patient sets foot in a care facility. Since COVID-19 hit, hospitals and home care organizations have been using online questionnaires to triage and monitor suspected coronavirus patients, with call centers contacting high-risk patients for additional information before referring them to the appropriate care provider. This has helped to prevent both staff and patients from being exposed to unnecessary risks, while using limited resources where they were needed the most. Although safety risks will subside as the pandemic abates, there are many other reasons why online screening and engagement tools will continue to see more widespread adoption \u2013 including increased convenience, a more engaged patient, and the potential to reduce hospital length of stay. For example, online lifestyle coaching could help get patients into better physical shape prior to a surgical procedure that would normally require them to stay in the hospital for a few days. With remote health monitoring added as a safety net after hospital discharge (see example #7 below), patients may be able to return home earlier to recover in the comfort of their homes. 2.

The objective of this report is to describe the obstacles for diagnosticians during the pandemic and also to discuss the potential beneficial application of telemedicine in the early diagnosis of Lyme disease during the COVID-19 era as well as in the future. Why was this study done? This case report aims to reveal the added diagnostic challenges for acute Lyme disease during the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential beneficial application of telemedicine. How was this study done? A health history of the patient in this case study was conducted along with an evaluation of the healthcare workflow changes that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. A quarantine after a negative PCR test for COVID-19 resulted in a deferment in the patient\u2019s evaluation for other causes of the patient\u2019s symptoms and led to disseminated Lyme disease infection and sixth nerve palsy.

These emerging telemedicine systems have been deployed and tested in a number of different health programs and hospitals. However, due to the lack of dedicated and reliable networking infrastructure, achieving real-time data collection is very challenging task. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis on the delay issues presented during the use of a store and forward telemonitoring system for congestive heart failure patients in urban Philadelphia. Results from this analysis reveal that 10.3% of the patient measurements experience delays of longer than 12 hours. Delays of up to several days occurred in 15.38% these patients who went on to be hospitalized. These delay issues exposed from urban scale real systems have direct impact on the quality of remote health care, causing late diagnosis and intervention especially when patients are experiencing acute exacerbations. Our investigation results essentially call for regulations on telemedicine systems with an emphasis on their temporal constraints. PubMed Disclaimer Similar articles Cited by MeSH terms Lin",

Driven by technological advancements and the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine adoption soared, redefining how care is delivered. But how does telemedicine stack up against traditional in-person visits, and what does the future hold for both? The Growth of Telemedicine Telemedicine involves the remote delivery of healthcare services through technology such as video calls, phone consultations, or mobile apps.\r According to a study by McKinsey & Company, telehealth utilization increased 38-fold from pre-pandemic levels in 2020, with 17% of outpatient and office visits conducted virtually. This trend has continued, albeit at a moderated pace, highlighting its growing acceptance among patients and providers. The Pros of Telemedicine One of the most significant advantages of telemedicine is its ability to overcome geographic and logistical barriers. Patients in remote or underserved areas can access specialists without traveling long distances, enhancing healthcare equity. A 2023 report by the American Medical Association underscored telehealth\u2019s role in closing healthcare gaps, particularly for rural populations.\r Additionally, telemedicine saves time and costs for both patients and healthcare systems. The Journal of Medical Internet Research noted that telehealth could save patients up to $50 per visit while significantly reducing no-show rates. Telemedicine also fosters continuity of care, especially for chronic disease management and mental health services. By enabling regular follow-ups and real-time monitoring through wearable devices or apps, it enhances patient adherence to treatment regimens. Research published in Nature Digital Medicine has shown that digital engagement via telehealth platforms can lead to better health outcomes.\r Furthermore,",

What will this new era of virtual care look like beyond the pandemic? Here are ten telehealth examples that give a glimpse into the future of healthcare delivery \u2013 showing how telehealth can not only deliver a more convenient experience to staff and patients, but also extend the reach of care to those who may have trouble accessing it. 1. Screening and engaging patients remotely before they enter a care facility \u00a0 Among the many examples of telehealth that were propelled by necessity during the pandemic, one that is likely to endure is online patient screening and engagement \u2013 even before the patient sets foot in a care facility. Since COVID-19 hit, hospitals and home care organizations have been using online questionnaires to triage and monitor suspected coronavirus patients, with call centers contacting high-risk patients for additional information before referring them to the appropriate care provider. This has helped to prevent both staff and patients from being exposed to unnecessary risks, while using limited resources where they were needed the most. Although safety risks will subside as the pandemic abates, there are many other reasons why online screening and engagement tools will continue to see more widespread adoption \u2013 including increased convenience, a more engaged patient, and the potential to reduce hospital length of stay. For example, online lifestyle coaching could help get patients into better physical shape prior to a surgical procedure that would normally require them to stay in the hospital for a few days. With remote health monitoring added as a safety net after hospital discharge (see example #7 below), patients may be able to return home earlier to recover in the comfort of their homes. \u00a0 Among the many examples of telehealth that w",

This next-generation of cellular connectivity promises greater speeds and lower latency, which will enable rapid, high-quality video connections. That\u2019s great for streaming videos, gaming, downloading apps, and so on. But what does it have to do with cardiac arrest, 911 medical emergencies, and other extreme health conditions? A lot, actually. Consider these statistics: Cardiovascular disease in Europe now accounts for 3.9 million deaths per year. In the United States, one in every four deaths is cardiac-related, and more than 700,000 Americans suffer heart attacks each year. These events are among the most common reasons for ambulance calls and emergency room visits. Here\u2019s why 5G matters in these situations. With faster connections enabling high-speed, high-quality video, healthcare workers can assess patients in a medical emergency before they arrive on the scene. They can direct other people at the scene to begin proper treatment. Once there, healthcare workers can connect via video conferencing to a hospital, clinic, or medical specialist to get highly detailed treatment onsite and while transporting the patient.\u00a0 Specialists at the other end of a video connection can review stroke victims or heart attack patients as they\u2019re being transported and help guide triage and direct ambulances to the right hospital for the fastest emergency treatment.

Telehealth technologies is a transformative force in the healthcare sector, revolutionizing how medical services are delivered. It leverages digital platforms to facilitate communication between patients and healthcare providers, overcoming geographical barriers and making healthcare more accessible. The telehealth technologies operate primarily through three methods: Store-And-Forward (Asynchronous) This method involves collecting medical data and then transmitting this data to a healthcare provider at a convenient time for assessment. It is commonly used in the following departments: Basically, all the clinical areas where a practitioner can gather and analyze various images as well as other types of data to make an accurate diagnosis. For instance, a dermatologist can review the patient\u2019s skin images and medical history sent through a secure platform and provide a diagnosis and treatment plan. This method is particularly beneficial in areas where access to specialists is limited.\u00a0 The data collected can range from medical ",

Each of these use cases showcases the potential of telehealth to improve patient access, enhance outcomes, and address disparities in healthcare delivery. Additionally, we will look into the role of modern healthcare technologies, such as video conferencing applications and mobile health apps, in facilitating telehealth services. Diverse Telehealth Use Cases Advancements in healthcare technology have expanded telehealth use cases, offering patients enhanced convenience and accessibility to medical services. Patients can attend virtual appointments with healthcare professionals without enduring long waits in crowded waiting rooms, reducing the risk of exposure to germs. Telehealth extends the geographical reach of healthcare services, enabling providers to reach patients residing in rural areas. This extends their ability to practice and serve patients outside their vicinity. By integrating telehealth, providers can attract more patients seeking non-urgent care. Moreover, telehealth solutions allow healthcare professionals to optimize their schedules with access to virtual waiting rooms and facilitate virtual check-ups during downtime. 1. Telehealth Use Cases: Telemedicine Telemedicine is the first of 5 telehealth use cases covered in this article. Telemedicine is often used interchangeably with telehealth. However, according to the Health Resources Administration (HRSA), telehealth differs from telemedicine. Telehealth encompasses a broader scope of remote healthcare services than telemedicine. Telemedicine deals specifically with remote clinical services. At the same time, telehealth can refer to remote non-clinical services. For example, provider training, administrative meetings, continuing medical education, and clinical services. 2. Telehealth Use Cases: Pregnancy Care Telehealth use cases include pregnancy care.

Let\u2019s take a look at 7 examples of telehealth technologies in action: 1. Screening and Engaging Patients Remotely before They Enter a Care Facility To reduce the spread of the COVID-19 virus, hospitals and medical organizations started using online patient screening to assess patients\u2019 health and ensure no one with multiple COVID-19 symptoms entered the facility or medical center. In some cases, call centers would be tasked with calling high-risk patients to gather more information on their condition before referring them to a provider. These precautions were implemented to reduce viral exposure for both patients and staff during a volatile time in the medical industry. While these practices aren\u2019t as necessary as the pandemic subsides, many providers will keep them in place as they provide convenience and reduce the length of stay at hospitals and other medical facilities. 2. Bringing Ultrasound Expertise to the bedside with Live Remote Collaboration Rural communities have always been at a disadvantage when it comes to receiving healthcare services, health education, and health resources. Tele-ultrasounds are a way to break past that barrier, allowing specialists to connect virtually with local providers. Healthcare professionals can manually operate the ultrasound machine, while specialists can examine the results in real-time and provide direct consultation. 3. Keeping a Caring Eye on Patients with Wearable Bio-sensors Remote patient monitoring is a tool that allows healthcare providers to monitor health conditions using wearable sensors and telecommunications technology. These digital sensors are typically used to track vital signs, including blood pressure, heart rate, and blood sugar. Some sensors can also track additional patient d",

In the past, seven day antibiotic therapy was recommended while the current practice is to treat uncomplicated UTI for three days. Objectives: TO compare the efficacy and safety of three-day antibiotic therapy to multi-day therapy (five days or longer) on relief of symptoms and bacteriuria at short-term and long-term follow-up. Search strategy: The Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2004), the Cochrane Renal Group's Register of trials (July 2003), EMBASE (January 1980 to August 2003), and MEDLINE (January 1966 to August 2003) were searched. We scanned references of all included studies and contacted the first or corresponding author of included trials and the pharmaceutical companies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing three-days oral antibiotic therapy with multi-day therapy (five days and longer) for uncomplicated cystitis in 18 to 65 years old non-pregnant women without signs of upper UTI.

As a result, innovative healthcare solutions are invaluable for reducing patient wait times. Telehealth solutions, such as eConsults, increase efficiency of care by improving access to specialists while also optimizing time and place of care. The shortage of specialist physicians in the United States continues to receive a great deal of attention. However, a lesser-known compounding factor is the increase in referral rates to specialists. In a 2012 study, the National Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys found that between 1999 and 2009, the probability of receiving a specialist referral during an ambulatory patient visit nearly doubled, from 4.8% to 9.3%. While this study is now several years old, we can surmise that this trend has continued due to the persistence of several factors contributing to the overall disparity between specialist referrals and the number of available specialist physicians. Taken together, the clear impact of these problems is substantially increased wait times among patients referred to specialists. In 15 major metro areas, a recent Merritt Hawkins study\u2014covering the medical specialties of cardiology, dermatology, orthopedic surgery, and OB-GYN\u2014found appointment wait times increased 25% from 2014 to 2017. Wait times averaged 24.1 days across the study, with some extreme cases waiting 165 days for an appointment. Source: Hospital Council Long wait times impact patient outcomes and healthcare operations On top of the emotional impact of having to wait for care, diseases can progress as patients sit in appointment queues for weeks or even months on end. As NEJM describes, \u201clong waits before appointments, particularly specialist appointments, often contribute to the development of avoidable complications,\u201d creating more difficulties both for patients and their physicians.

These permissions are granted for free by Elsevier for as long as the COVID-19 resource centre remains active. Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

This practice has been around almost as long as telephones but has become more popular and practical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in technology and changes to insurance reimbursement rulings have helped increase the acceptance of telemedicine. Without it, doctors and therapists wouldn\u2019t be able to connect with patients as easily, especially during the pandemic. As telemedicine has become widespread, professionals and patients have grown more comfortable connecting virtually. Benefits Telemedicine isn\u2019t meant to take the place of face-to-face visits. While it does have some disadvantages, which we\u2019ll get into later, its benefits are undeniable. They include: 1. Easy access to specialists Not everyone has an ongoing relationship with a doctor they can call when they need one. Many online medical networks offer round-the-clock access to all kinds of specialists, without an appointment, at any time of day or night. 2. Lower cost Doctors and therapists can be expensive, even for people with good health insurance. Telemedicine appointments typically cost less than in-person visits do. This reduces out-of-pocket costs, removing a barrier to care. 3. Medical access for people without health insurance Not having adequate health insurance can be an obstacle to seeing a doctor. Many online companies provide cash-pay telemedicine, which doesn\u2019t require health insurance or referrals. 4. Medical access for people in rural areas Country living has many benefits, but fast access to medical care isn\u2019t always one of them. For people who live many miles from the nearest medical facility, telemedicine provides a way to meet with a doctor quickly. This saves time and allows people to stay off the road when driving conditions are less than optimal, such as during a snowstorm or hailstorm. 5. Medical access for people in underserved urban areas The trend of hospita",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

The same is true for mental healthcare. However, did the increase in tele-mental health visits translate into a higher quality of care? \u201cPatients receiving care from practices that had a higher level of telemedicine use during the COVID-19 pandemic had more mental health visits per year compared with pre-pandemic levels, with no differential changes in other observed quality metrics over the same period,\u201d the authors of a recent study concluded.1 Perhaps patients felt more at ease to schedule and attend these virtual appointments, and it became more mainstream to do so \u2014 only it did not necessarily result in better outcomes in terms of quality of care. \u201cWith the pandemic, telehealth helped with access to mental healthcare services and gave providers a chance to treat patients when opportunities for inpatient visits were restricted,\u201d says Vivian Campagna, DNP, RN-BC, CCM, chief industry relations officer for The Commission for Case Manager Certification. \u201cThis enhanced access to telehealt",

Abstract The extensive uptake of telehealth has considerably transformed health care delivery since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and has imposed tremendous challenges to its large-scale implementation and adaptation. Given the shift in paradigm from telehealth as an alternative mechanism of care delivery to telehealth as an integral part of the health system, it is imperative to take a systematic approach to identifying barriers to, opportunities for, and the overall impact of telehealth implementation amidst the current pandemic.

ABSTRACT Objectives: To examine the organizational characteristics associated with telemedicine services provided by mental health care organizations before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Study Design: Using 2019-2020 National Mental Health Services Survey data, we assessed changes in provisions of telemedicine services by mental health care facilities before and after onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: We estimated multivariable logistic regression models comparing pre- vs postpandemic changes in prevalence of telemedicine offered by mental health care facilities. We incorporated mental health care organizations\u2019 characteristics, including facility type, accepted payment, geography, and language service provisions, as well as state-level policies, such as payment parity laws, shelter-in-place laws, and number of COVID-19 cases. Results: Mental health care facilities had 4 times the odds (odds ratio [OR], 4.3; 95% CI, 4.09-4.61)\u200b\u200b of telemedicine provision post pandemic in 2020 compared with prepandemic in 2019. In 2020, facilities that accepted Medicaid (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.11-1.49) and Medicare (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.14-1.39) were more likely to provide telemedicine than those that did not. Facilities that offered American Sign Language (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.16-1.43) and non\u2013English language services (OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.15-1.44) were more likely to provide telemedicine than facilities that did not. Facilities located in states with payment parity laws (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.11-1.36) were more likely to offer telemedicine than states without.

Findings This cross-sectional secret shopper study of 1404 MHTFs conducted from December 2022 to March 2023 found that privately owned facilities with only outpatient services were most likely to offer telehealth services. No differences were found to be associated with the client-caller\u2019s perceived race, ethnicity, sex, or presenting mental health condition.

Telemedicine has the ability to improve access for these populations by allowing psychiatrists in urban settings to treat rural patients over video. However, start-up costs may hinder implementation of new tele-psychiatry programs. Materials and Methods: We created a model to estimate the point at which tele-psychiatry would financially break even based on estimates of improved access to outpatient care for people with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. We demonstrate how our model can be used with an example of a tele-psychiatry program serving five rural Indian Health Services clinics in California. Results: When reimbursement for psychiatric services provided over telemedicine is relatively low compared to reimbursement for hospitalization visits, changes in the ratio of hospitalizations to telemedicine visits have very little impact on required hospitalization improvement. Conclusions: Tele-psychiatry programs are likely to break even within the first three years when providing psychiatry services to a rural community with a s",

Using telehealth in rural areas to deliver and assist with the delivery of healthcare services can reduce or minimize challenges and burdens patients encounter, such as transportation issues related to traveling for specialty care. Telehealth uses telecommunications technology and other electronic data to conduct and supplement clinical healthcare services \u2014 including education, administrative functions, and professional consultations \u2014 provided at a distance. Health information technology (HIT) uses technology to store, secure, retrieve, and transfer protected health information electronically within healthcare systems and community settings. Together, telehealth and HIT can improve monitoring, timeliness, and communications throughout the healthcare system. Telehealth became a more prominent mode of providing healthcare during the COVID-19 pandemic, when patients and providers sought to decrease in-person contact for routine visits. In order to expand access to telehealth from patients' homes and increase provider flexibility, laws, reimbursement policies, and regulations were temporarily changed through emergency orders and legislation. Some of these policy changes at the state and federal level have become permanent or extended beyond the COVID-19 public health emergency (PHE), while others have ended. This guide provides an overview of telehealth and HIT in rural America to help healthcare providers find information related to implementing telehealth and HIT programs and services, and highlights funding opportunities and other initiatives to support services. Challenges for maintaining HIT systems and providing telehealth services in rural areas are also discussed, such as workforce issues, quality of care c",

However, uptake and widespread integration of telehealth across all parts of the health system has been slow, with a myriad of barriers documented, including in rural settings. The crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic, saw barriers rapidly overturned with the unprecedented and exponential rise in telehealth usage. The uniqueness of the crisis forced telehealth adoption, but as the urgency stabilises, pandemic learnings must be captured, utilised, and built upon in a post-pandemic world. The aim of this study was to document staff experiences and perceptions of delivering rural psychological therapies via telehealth during the pandemic and to capture learnings for future rural telehealth delivery. Methods An online cross-sectional survey that explored mental health professional\u2019s experiences, use, and perceptions of telehealth before and after pandemic-enforced changes to service delivery. Results Sixty-two respondents completed the questionnaire (response rate 68%). Both the delivery of telehealth via telephone and online video conferencing significantly increased during the pandemic (66% vs 98%, p\u2009<\u2009.001 for telephone and 10% vs 89%, p\u2009<\u20090.001 for online video). Respondents indicated that client\u2019s access to services and attendance had improved with telehealth use but their attention and focus during sessions and non-verbal communication had been negatively affected. The challenges for older adults, people with learning and sensory disabilities, and residents in remote areas with poorer mobile/internet connectivity were identified.

Abstract Background and aims: Common Mental Disorders (CMD) emerged as a substantial global burden, emphasizing the necessity of investigating effective treatment modalities, particularly in telemedicine. This umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis systematically evaluated telemedicine's effectiveness for CMD. Methods Key databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were searched for telemedicine interventions targeting CMD, including depression and anxiety.

Material method: For this meta-analysis study, data were obtained by searching PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCOhost, Google Scholar, and Y\u00d6K Thesis Center databases for the last 5 years in September-December 2023. After the review, 24 studies were included. Findings: In this meta-analysis, it was found that telemedicine interventions in mental health services decreased the depression level of individuals (SMD - 0.168, 95% CI - 0.315 to - 0.021; Z = - 2.243; p < .05). In addition, it was determined that the duration of the intervention played a role in the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions applied to individuals. In addition, it was determined that the type of intervention, the country where the research was conducted, and the patient group did not play a role in the effectiveness of telemedicine interventions applied to individuals. Conclusion: Telemedicine applications in mental health services can play an effective role in reducing the burden of chronic mental illness and improving patient outcomes.

Meta-analyses have examined the reliability (ie, concordance) of assessment and the efficacy/effectiveness of telemental health compared with in-person care. Results indicate that telemental health assessment and clinical outcomes are similar compared with in-person care but there is much unexplained variability, as well as evidence that patient clinical and demographic characteristics can influence these findings. Further, gaps exist in the literature regarding specific patient populations (eg, psychotic disorders, children/adolescents), treatment modalities (eg, group therapy), audio only telemedicine, and hybrid care that mixes in-person with telemental health care. These gaps provide important directions for the next generation of telemental health research. Comprehensive clinical guidelines from mental health organizations are available to telemental health practitioners and focus on five content themes: legal and regulatory issues, clinical considerations, standard operating procedures and protocols, technical requirements, and considerations of specific populations and settings. Introduction Before the covid-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine (ie, care delivered via videoconferencing or phone/audio only) had been increasing in mental healthcare but was not prevalent.123 The pandemic, with its pressure to enact social distancing when possible and a concomitant relaxation of healthcare payment and regulatory policies to facilitate rapid adoption of telemedicine, vastly accelerated its use, particularly for the care of mental health conditions.45678 Several terms have been used to describe the delivery of mental healthcare via telemedicine, including telemental health, telepsychology, telepsychiatry, and teletherapy.

Received 2015 Oct 15; Accepted 2015 Oct 16. Abstract Problem and Objective: This research derives from the confluence of several factors, namely, the prevalence of a complex array of mental health issues across age, social, ethnic, and economic groups, an increasingly critical shortage of mental health professionals and the associated disability and productivity loss in the population, and the potential of telemental health (TMH) to ameliorate these problems. Definitive information regarding the true merit of telemedicine applications and intervention is now of paramount importance among policymakers, providers of care, researchers, payers, program developers, and the public at large. This is necessary for rational policymaking, prudent resource allocation decisions, and informed strategic planning. This article is aimed at assessing the state of scientific knowledge regarding the merit of telemedicine interventions in the treatment of mental disorders (TMH) in terms of feasibility/acceptance, effects on medication compliance, health outcomes, and cost.

Abstract Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have major and long-lasting impacts on health care delivery and mental health. As health care shifted to telehealth, legislation was adjusted to expand telehealth allowances, creating a unique opportunity to elucidate outcomes. The aim of this study was to assess long-term patient and clinician satisfaction and outcomes with virtual behavioral health. Methods Data were obtained over 16 months from surveys to patients and clinicians receiving/providing virtual treatment. Outcomes data also were collected from medical records of adults receiving in-person and virtual behavioral health treatment. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Groups were compared using various chi-squared tests for categorical variables, Likert response trends over time, and conditional independence, with Wilcoxon rank-sum or Jonckheere trend test used to assess continuous variables. P-values of \u22640.05 were considered statistically significant. Results Patients gave high ratings to virtual treatment and indicated a preference for virtual formats. Both patient and clinician preference for virtual visits increased significantly with time, and many clinicians perceived virtual services to be equally effective to in-person.

Issue date 2022 Apr 1. Abstract Objective: The study examined temporal and geographic trends in telehealth availability at U.S. behavioral health treatment facilities and risk factors for not offering telehealth. Methods: Longitudinal data on 15,691 outpatient behavioral health treatment facilities were extracted daily from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration\u2019s Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator between January 20, 2020, and January 20, 2021. Facilities operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs were excluded. Bivariate analyses were used to assess trends in telehealth availability in 2020 and 2021. Multivariable regression analysis was used to examine facility- and county-level characteristics associated with telehealth availability in 2021. Results: Telehealth availability increased by 77% from 2020 to 2021 for mental health treatment facilities and by 143% for substance use disorder treatment facilities. By January 2021, 68% of outpatient mental health facilities and 57% of substance use disorder treatment facilities in the sample were offering telehealth. Mental health and substance use disorder treatment facilities that did not accept Medicaid as a form of payment were less likely to offer telehealth in 2021, compared with facilities that accepted Medicaid.

Keywords: Telecommunications, Health care reform There is little debate that the U.S. mental health care system is in dire need of delivery reform. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that suicide rates increased by 33% from 1999 to 2017, with the highest increase in rural counties, where suicide rates were nearly twice as high as rates in urban areas by 2017. In 2018, 115 million Americans lived in a mental health professional shortage area (1), and according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, nearly one-quarter of adults with mental illness reported an unmet need for mental health treatment. The gap in mental health access is particularly wide for low-income individuals with Medicaid; in 2015, only about one-third of psychiatrists were accepting new Medicaid patients, compared with over 70% of primary care and other specialist physicians (2). One promising solution to bridge at least some of the gaps in access is telemedicine. Typically defined by payers such as Medicare and Medicaid as the use of communications technology for two-way real time interactive communication between patient and provider (42 CFR \u00a7 410.78), telemedicine is particularly well suited for the delivery of mental health care. Although a major limitation of telemedicine is the lack of opportunity for in-person contact, mental health diagnosis and therapy are generally conducted by in",

Abstract Background Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK Effects and Effectiveness of Telemedicine Jim Grigsby, Ph.D. Margaret M Kaehny Elliot J Sandberg, M.D. Robert E Schlenker, Ph.D. Peter W Shaughnessy, Ph.D. Abstract The use of telemedicine has recently undergone rapid growth and proliferation. Although the feasibility of many applications has been tested for nearly 30 years, data concerning the costs, effects, and effectiveness of telemedicine are limited. Consequently, the development of a strategy for coverage, payment, and utilization policy has been hindered. Telemedicine continues to expand, and pressure for policy development increases in the context of Federal budget cuts and major changes in health service financing. This article reviews the literature on the effects and medical effectiveness of telemedicine. It concludes with several recommendations for research, followed by a discussion of several specific questions, the answers to which might have a bearing on policy development. Introduction Telemedicine is the use of telecommunications technology to provide health care services to persons who are at some distance from the provider. It involves a spectrum of technologies (Perednia and Allen, 1995; Perednia and Grigsby, 1995) including facsimile, medical data transmission, audio-only format (telephone and radio), still images, and full-motion video. Robotics (Minsky, 1979; Satava, 1992) and virtual reality interfaces (Kelly, 1994) have been introduced into some experimental applications. To be covered by Medicare, HCFA requires that medical services for processes ordinarily involving physician-patient contact be delivered in person. The use of the telepho",

Breadcrumb Expanding Access to Behavioral Health Services Through Telehealth As we\u2019ve learned, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted many people\u2019s mental health, which intensified the need for more behavioral health services across the country. Mental health is defined as an overall state of well-being that includes biology, emotional health, and habits while behavioral health examines how habits impact a person\u2019s overall physical and mental well-being. While the pandemic created mental health challenges for many people, it also spurred advancement in health care services in America. Behavioral telehealth is one example. It is a growing area of care that is helping to deliver greater access to mental health care for patients across the country, including those in rural and underserved communities. Here are three innovative ways to use behavioral telehealth services that patients can access safely, privately, and conveniently from home. Individual Teletherapy Individual, one-on-one teletherapy is the most common form of telebehavioral health and may be able to be performed through video or audio-only telehealth services. It can offer privacy and convenience, including reduced travel and disruption to daily activities like work and childcare, in addition to easing the stigma of going in-person to a clinic or office. You can access individual teletherapy in multiple ways: Group Teletherapy \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Group teletherapy involves a few people who meet with one or more therapists remotely.

Both federal and state legislative groups have focused heavily on passing behavioral telehealth regulations to be enacted in 2023 and are poised to extend in subsequent years. First, the Public Health Emergency (PHE) is likely to be extended for three months in January, bringing today\u2019s best predictions for the end of the PHE to April 2023. In addition, the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2022 ensures a 151-day extension period beyond the end of the PHE to allow for a transition before many of the policies outlined in the COVID-19 PHE are currently set to expire. Numerous groups are urging Congress to take more extensive and decisive action. Concerns center on what to expect regarding telehealth benefits and repercussions leading to interruptions to the continuum of care in the absence of the PHE. The National Association of Medicaid Directors (NAMD) submitted a letter to congressional leaders stating that the lack of clarity about another extension \u201cexacerbates the uncertainties for state planning to resume normal Medicaid operations.\u201d A consumer poll by America\u2019s Health Insurance Plans reported a strong consumer preference for telehealth to remain available, with\u00a073% of commercially-insured telehealth users indicating that Congress should make telehealth provisions permanent.\u00a0 This article below will review several key elemental health and behavioral telehealth legislative issues at the federal level, the individual state level, and within several key behavioral professions.

Rural residents are more likely to die from chronic conditions, according to the CDC, including: The gaps span all ages ranges as well. Rural residents are generally older and sicker than urban residents, according to the CDC. And rural children with mental or developmental disorders face more challenges than their peers in urban settings. Lack of access to healthcare is one of the top reasons for this gap. The barriers to care include: Difficulties for providers Healthcare challenges in rural and frontier locations extend to providers also.

By First Products on 12/19/22 12:03 PM An essential part of healthcare is ensuring all communities have access to the best doctors and hospitals nearby. Access to high-quality care is especially crucial in rural areas. Sometimes, rural communities won't know about advancements in medical care and treatments because of poor access and communication. This lack of information can be a significant obstacle to improving health outcomes in these areas. Telemedicine is a leader in helping patients connect with doctors and healthcare providers. How does telemedicine benefit rural communities? In short, it cuts commute time in half and allows doctors and patients to strengthen their relationships, while also providing numerous other advantages that impact everyday life in these areas. Let's break down eight key benefits: 1. Rural Community Members Don't Need To Travel Far Rural communities don't have extensive access to healthcare resources, aggravated by limited internet access among low-income and rural populations. There have been more hospital closures in less densely populated areas due to Medicaid coverage, location, and not performing well in their network. This trend has aggravated the existing transport challenges faced by rural residents seeking medical care. Telemedicine devices and monitors -- mounted on rolling carts -- allow patients to communicate with doctors through video, apps and devices that track their biometrics, perform life-saving surgery, and other preventive healthcare activities. The logistics of healthcare delivery in rural areas are significantly improved through telemedicine. Patients no longer need to arrange long-distance transportation or take entire days off work for a single appointment, which can have positive economic impacts on both individual families and the broader community. \u00a0 2. Rural Communities Have Better Access to Healthcare Many small-town hospitals shut down due to funding issues,",

Ask most rural residents, and they\u2019ll have a long list of the reasons they love their rural community. And nearly 80% of rural small business owners agree the quality of life and cost of living is much better in rural areas, according to the U.S. Chamber Technology Engagement Center. All this is true despite the ways rural communities quantitatively lag behind their metropolitan counterparts \u2014 for example, access to healthcare providers like hospitals, primary doctors, and specialists. Access to healthcare is necessary for a thriving community, and residents in rural areas deserve equal access to quality healthcare. So how do rural areas overcome any gaps in healthcare access? Telehealth offers impactful methods of providing healthcare and outreach to rural communities. What Is Telehealth? The telehealth definition used in this article is the delivery of healthcare to individuals over a high-speed internet connection. In addition to having virtual meetings with healthcare providers, other types of services include: telemedicine (the provision of remote medical care via the Internet and video conferencing),\u00a0 electronic medical record keeping, and\u00a0 portal technology and videoconferencing.\u00a0 Remote health monitoring tools such as wearables and biosensors that track and report personal health information have also become commonplace for remote health care. Combined, these methods of communicating with healthcare providers help close the rural-urban healthcare access divide.

Other outcomes included assessing specialty availability and frequency of referrals at rural sites. Methods This mixed methods study included surveys and semi-structured interviews of rural primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey data were analyzed with summary statistics and cross-tabulations. Interview transcripts were inductively thematically analyzed. Results Of the 19 PCPs who completed the survey, 37% agreed/strongly agreed current telemedicine practices connected patients to better specialty care; 90% agreed/strongly agreed it had such potential. Interviews revealed telemedicine could improve care when local specialists were unavailable and provided the most benefit in acute care settings or specialist follow-ups. Most survey respondents reported outreach specialists were highly effective in addressing rural specialty care needs. Respondents reported cardiology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, ENT/otolaryngology, and dermatology as the most frequently referred-to specialties. In-person neurology, gastroenterol",

A population that is spread across great distances and often doesn\u2019t have effective health insurance. For rural healthcare providers, delivering high quality care means facing unique challenges that don\u2019t come up in most urban settings.\u00a0 In the United States, rural healthcare serves one-quarter of the nation\u2019s population. Rural healthcare does many things incredibly well, such as personalization and continuity of care. However, rural health has historically faced many challenges, and unfortunately, several of these issues have only been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to care, distance, connectivity, and financial hardship are only a few of the hurdles rural health has had to grapple with.\u00a0 Recently, prominent rural healthcare authorities in Georgia and Colorado Springs sat down for exclusive interviews with Pulsara to weigh in on some of the challenges that rural clinicians are currently facing, as well as some of the innovative solutions they believe can help.\u00a0 In this 5-part blog series, we will explore each of the top 5 challenges that rural healthcare currently faces, and how new technology could be key to solving some of them. Today, we'll tackle the first challenge: Access. Access to care is the largest, most complex issue currently facing rural health for one reason: the sheer number of barriers rural residents face in simply getting care in the first place.\u00a0 Dr. Jean Sumner, Dean of the School of Medicine at Mercer University in Macon, Georgia, explained the type of care that rural residents should have. \u201cEvery community should have quality care, and they should have access to care 24/7. That may be a doctor's office with emergency access that turns into an urgent care after hours and on weekends, and preferably with a strong telehealth connection and ability to transfer to a regional hospital.\u201d She then contrasted it with what is often the reality: \u201cR",

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

Methods: This is a prospective cohort study of patients receiving telemedicine (TM) consultation for specialty care of diabetes, hypertension, and/or kidney disease with a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) as the originating site and an academic medical center (AMC) multispecialty group practice as the distant site in an urban setting. Primary data were collected onsite at a local FQHC and an urban AMC between March 2017 and March 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical outcomes of study participants were compared with matched controls (CON) from a sister FQHC site who were referred for traditional in-person specialty visits at the AMC. No-show rates for study participants were calculated and compared to their no-show rates for standard (STD) in-person specialty visits at the AMC during the study period.

A review of the literature indicates that (a) telemedicine has improved access to care for a wide range of clinical conditions ranging from stroke to pregnancy; (b) telemedicine in select circumstances has demonstrated improved health outcomes; and (c) telemedicine has addressed geographical, but less so social, barriers to care. For telemedicine to fulfill its promise, additional evidence needs to be gathered on health outcomes and cost savings, the digital divide needs to be bridged, and policy changes that support telemedicine reimbursement need to be enacted.

Despite proven benefits and policy reforms, the use of telemedicine remains low due to several patient, technology, and system-level barriers. Assisted telemedicine employs trained health professionals to connect patients with physicians, which can improve access and scope of telemedicine. The study aims to describe the design, service utilisation and chronic disease outcomes following the implementation of an assisted telemedicine initiative. Methods This is an observational implementation study. Barriers and potential solutions to the implementation of telemedicine were identified through interviews with key stakeholders. The assisted telemedicine solution using an interoperable platform integrating electronic health records, point-of-care diagnostics, and electronic clinical decision support systems was designed and piloted at three telemedicine clinics in Tamil Nadu, India. Nurses were trained in platform use and facilitation of tele-consultations. Health records of all patients from March 2021 to June 2023 were included in the analysis. Data were analysed to assess the utilisation of clinic services and improvements in health outcomes in patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Results Over 2.4 years, 11,388 patients with a mean age of 45 (\u00b1\u200920) years and median age of 48 years, predominantly female (59.3%), accessed the clinics. The team completed 15,437 lab investigations and 26,998 consultations. Among 5542 (48.6%) patients that reported chronic conditions, diabetes mellitus (61%) and hypertension (45%) were the most frequent. In patients with diabetes mellitus and hypertension, 43% and 75.3%",

Last Reviewed: 6/8/2023 Telehealth Models for Increasing Access to Specialty Care Specialists offer more advanced care than primary care providers, but access may be restricted based on physician referral, geographic location, and insurance type. Specialists also tend to be located in urban areas and there are fewer of them when compared to primary care providers. Telehealth connects patients to specialized medical services that may be otherwise unavailable in their community. Additionally, patients can avoid extra visits, scheduling, and wait periods if the specialist is regularly available for telehealth appointments. The National Advisory Committee on Rural Health and Human Services 2015 policy brief, Telehealth in Rural America, discusses how telehealth can help rural individuals receive effective care in many areas. Some of the specialty care services available to rural patients via telehealth include dental care, cardiology, endocrinology, genetic counseling, dermatology, psychiatry, oncology, ophthalmology, and obstetrics. Telehealth for Live-video Teleconference and E-Consultation Live-video teleconference and e-consultation are two telehealth methods most often used by rural providers to connect with specialty providers. Telehealth consults enable primary care providers and frontline physicians located in rural areas to receive real-time support from specialists, which increases their ability to make better diagnoses and develop appropriate care plans. E-consultation involves the use of web-based programs or shared electronic medical records to improve quality of care and reduce specialty care costs.

Telemedicine has the potential to bridge the gap between socioeconomic divide and create more culturally sensitive attitudes towards healthcare for minorities and rural populations. In terms of rural America, this means that nearly\u00a022% of total Medicare beneficiaries\u00a0in rural areas used telehealth services. The CARES Act allows \u201cqualified health centers and rural health centers to serve as eligible sites of care for telehealth services\u201d while also removing the geographic restrictions on Medicare coverage of telehealth services; this enabled most patients to access quality healthcare from any corner. However, this does not completely detract from the issue that about\u00a012% of rural Americans are less likely to have internet connectivity. This is likely to decrease with the launch of the\u00a0Rural Digital Opportunity Fund Auction, which will provide internet companies with $20 billion to expand their broadband networks and support rural areas.\u00a0 The applications of telehealth can extend beyond rural America. In India, there is a lack of awareness about the concept of primary health care, much less about the benefits of telehealth.

According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, if rural residents were to receive the same access to health care as urban residents, by 2034 rural areas would need to source and relocate an additional 180,000 doctors. This gap not only compromises patient care but also leads to limited access to specialized care, decreased patient volume, and financially unsustainable solutions in rural health care systems. How is telemedicine bridging this gap? As observed over two decades, telemedicine has been shown to improve patient outcomes. The Society of Critical Care Medicine reports that through telemedicine, specialized services such as ICU have seen reduced costs and lengths of stay. Studies show that health care-associated infections have also dropped, and ICU mortality has decreased by 40 percent. Through this resource, the geographical gap between rural patients and specialist care is beginning to close. Outside of the ICU, patients have access to one-on-one time with specialists all over the country with response times as short as 1 minute and 9 seconds. This form of inpatient telehealth also gives patients more time with providers and the ability to reach specialists who can better meet their needs. This technology is breaking down language, time, and geographical barriers to even the most rural community hospitals. Telemedicine not only connects patients with specialists but also fosters collaborative care networks among health care providers. Through seamless communication and information sharing among providers, patients are better served in urban and rural areas. A study published in the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare found that teleconsultations between primary care providers and specialists increased by 67 percent over the past year, leading to more comprehensive and timely car",

Abstract Telemedicine has traditionally been used in rural areas, but the recent development of mHealth solutions has led to a growth in urban telemedicine services. The aim of this study was to determine whether urban and rural patients in a large academic medical center use telemedicine to access different healthcare specialties at different rates. This retrospective cohort study examined all telemedicine visits dated 2008-2017 at a large academic medical center. Visits were classified by clinical specialty. Teledermatology, child telepsychiatry, and adult telepsychiatry made up 97 percent of telemedicine visits. Rural patients were more likely to have multiple telehealth visits. A significant difference was observed between rural and urban use of telemedicine, both in terms of specialties and demographics. This suggests that health systems should consider adjusting resources and training to meet the different needs of these two populations. In particular, telemedicine may offer help for the nationwide maldistribution of adolescent psychiatry providers.

Telehealth was introduced as a temporary measure but is being considered as a more permanent form of healthcare, particularly in rural areas, to provide more equitable healthcare. A survey was conducted on 200 rural dwellers (residents) regarding their experience with rural healthcare, any barriers to adequate healthcare, and openness to telehealth. The results demonstrated interest in telehealth and predominately positive experiences with telehealth in the areas where there was need and lack of access to healthcare, more commonly expressed in the younger age group. Quality healthcare should be equitable and available for every individual irrespective of zip code or the county they live. Telehealth is capable of bridging the gap of lack of access and transportation for individuals in rural areas to meet their healthcare needs in a timely fashion in the coming years. Introduction The implementation of telehealth and telemedicine services was spread by the COVID-19 pandemic1 due to lockdown and social distancing measures. Traditional medical appointments with in-person physicians became more difficult, and telehealth was implemented on a large scale in many hospital systems as a temporary substitute. In addition to spreading telehealth, the pandemic exposed underlying health disparities in several communities, especially rural areas.1 The rural health disparity is caused by a combination of complex factors, including economic opportunities, education quality, substance abuse, chronic illnesses, HIV, poverty, and unemployment.1,2 Almost one in five Americans live in rural areas.2 Although the rural health disparity has lasted for several deca",

Other outcomes included assessing specialty availability and frequency of referrals at rural sites. Methods: This mixed methods study included surveys and semi-structured interviews of rural primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey data were analyzed with summary statistics and cross-tabulations. Interview transcripts were inductively thematically analyzed. Results: Of the 19 PCPs who completed the survey, 37% agreed/strongly agreed current telemedicine practices connected patients to better specialty care; 90% agreed/strongly agreed it had such potential. Interviews revealed telemedicine could improve care when local specialists were unavailable and provided the most benefit in acute care settings or specialist follow-ups. Most survey respondents reported outreach specialists were highly effective in addressing rural specialty care needs.

Other outcomes included assessing specialty availability and frequency of referrals at rural sites. Methods This mixed methods study included surveys and semi-structured interviews of rural primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey data were analyzed with summary statistics and cross-tabulations. Interview transcripts were inductively thematically analyzed. Results Of the 19 PCPs who completed the survey, 37% agreed/strongly agreed current telemedicine practices connected patients to better specialty care; 90% agreed/strongly agreed it had such potential. Interviews revealed telemedicine could improve care when local specialists were unavailable and provided the most benefit in acute care settings or specialist follow-ups. Most survey respondents reported outreach specialists were highly effective in addressing rural specialty care needs.

Driven by technological advancements and the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine adoption soared, redefining how care is delivered. But how does telemedicine stack up against traditional in-person visits, and what does the future hold for both? The Growth of Telemedicine Telemedicine involves the remote delivery of healthcare services through technology such as video calls, phone consultations, or mobile apps.\r According to a study by McKinsey & Company, telehealth utilization increased 38-fold from pre-pandemic levels in 2020, with 17% of outpatient and office visits conducted virtually. This trend has continued, albeit at a moderated pace, highlighting its growing acceptance among patients and providers. The Pros of Telemedicine One of the most significant advantages of telemedicine is its ability to overcome geographic and logistical barriers. Patients in remote or underserved areas can access specialists without traveling long distances, enhancing healthcare equity. A 2023 report by the American Medical Association underscored telehealth\u2019s role in closing healthcare gaps, particularly for rural populations.\r Additionally, telemedicine saves time and costs for both patients and healthcare systems. The Journal of Medical Internet Research noted that telehealth could save patients up to $50 per visit while significantly reducing no-show rates. Telemedicine also fosters continuity of care, especially for chronic disease management and mental health services. By enabling regular follow-ups and real-time monitoring through wearable devices or apps, it enhances patient adherence to treatment regimens. Research published in Nature Digital Medicine has shown that digital engagement via telehealth platforms can lead to better health outcomes.\r Furthermore,",

Telemedicine: A Guide to Assessing Telecommunications in Health Care. 7Evaluating the Effects of Telemedicine on Quality, Access, and Cost Does telepyschiatry provide more timely access to appropriate behavioral health services than conventional arrangements for patients in a remote rural community? How does it affect patients' health and well-being compared to the alternatives? How do costs compare? Are patients and clinicians satisfied with the services? Would they want to use them in the future? Why or why not? These are the kinds of questions that clinicians, patients, managers, and policymakers want answered about telemedicine. This chapter focuses on questions about the quality, accessibility, cost, and acceptability of telemedicine services. Additional questions will, however, be relevant for some organizations, some communities, and some evaluations. For example, because many telemedicine programs also serve educational and administrative purposes, evaluations may reasonably seek to assess results in these areas. The committee's evaluation framework likewise provides for strategic objectives such as strengthening an organization's competitive positive.

Abstract Background Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.

This is particularly true during the COVID-19 epidemic that has been going on since 2019. Nevertheless, it is not yet known whether patients who choose telemedicine are happier than patients who choose to have in-person consultations. This systematic review will assess the existing literature to determine whether or not telemedicine consultations are superior to in-person visits from the patients' point of view. Using keywords connected to telemedicine and patient satisfaction, a search was conducted across a variety of electronic sites, including, but not limited to, Medline, ProQuest, PubMed, Ebsco, Google Scholar, and the Web of Science. An examination via the lens of the story was carried out on the included empirical experiments. This particular evaluation included a total of ten manuscripts from an assortment of clinical specialties. Most studies found that patients were satisfied with telemedicine consultations; some even discovered that patients favored telemedicine consultations over in-person sessions.

The evidence base for telemedicine is heterogeneous and its efficacy remains debated. We, therefore, designed a mixed-methods semi-structured survey to evaluate patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 experiences of outpatient telemedicine clinics during the pandemic. One-hundred and eighty-eight patients and 69 clinicians from two hospitals in Gloucestershire completed the survey. The quantitative results for patients rated in-person and telemedicine appointments similarly in all areas except communication (p<0.001) and overall quality (p=0.004), both in favour of in-person consultations, while clinicians rated all aspects of telemedicine appointments as inferior, with the exception of convenience (p=0.643). Qualitative analysis highlighted themes of communication and relationship building difficulties, confidentiality concerns, loss of visual inspection as a clinical tool and debatable time efficiency associated with telemedicine. Significant adaptation of current telemedicine services is required before it will be integrated into current practice.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

One of the areas where telemedicine has had a particularly profound impact is in mental health care. A 2022 survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation and CNN revealed that 90% of the public believes there is a mental health crisis in the United States. This is underscored by the fact that nearly half of young adults and a third of all adults had reported experiencing anxiety frequently over the past year. Telemedicine, also commonly referred to as telehealth, has played a vital role in addressing this crisis by expanding access to mental health services, especially in underserved rural areas, where a shortage of mental health professionals has been a long-standing issue. Virtual consultations allow providers to extend their reach to these populations, reducing wait times, overcoming geographic barriers, and easing the burden of travel.

However this doesn\u2019t spell the end for telemedicine, simply a new beginning and a chance for the industry to re-asses, optimize and improve virtual offerings to better suit the needs of patients and practitioners. Kyle Zebley, SVP of public policy for the American Telemedicine Association (ATA) is optimistic; \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any interest in yanking the US healthcare system back toward the pre-pandemic normalcy in terms of having very limited access to telehealth and virtual care services.\u201d As we near the end of the year, we\u2019re unpacking some emerging (and continuing) trends in the sector and taking a look at how Telehealth could evolve into 2025. AI will drastically improve efficiency Yawn, not another blog post about AI... It might be the buzzword of 2024, but we strongly believe that Artificial Intelligence is set to become a cornerstone of telehealth innovation. The rise in AI technology is impacting all areas of our daily lives, and healthcare is no exception. Specifically for telemedicine, there is huge potential for AI to improve efficiencies and workflows for example by automating routine tasks and analyzing vast amounts of data. AI-driven tools will streamline administrative workflows, from scheduling appointments to managing patient records, to transcribing virtual consultations, reducing the burden on healthcare professionals.

Given that many rural communities in the United States face lower access to health care relative to urban communities, telehealth offers a potential opportunity to support health care access in these underserved areas. In particular, telehealth can partly help offset fewer hospitals and health care professionals per capita in rural areas compared to their metropolitan counterparts. However, the digital divide in access to broadband and digital devices between urban and rural communities means that telehealth access has not been equally enjoyed across space. In this post, we identify where health care deserts are located within the Fifth District. Additionally, we measure how broadband and digital device access (defined as the use of a tablet, laptop or smartphone) differs betw",

Results Of the 19 PCPs who completed the survey, 37% agreed/strongly agreed current telemedicine practices connected patients to better specialty care; 90% agreed/strongly agreed it had such potential. Interviews revealed telemedicine could improve care when local specialists were unavailable and provided the most benefit in acute care settings or specialist follow-ups. Most survey respondents reported outreach specialists were highly effective in addressing rural specialty care needs.

These situations may arise occasionally in our lives. Still, for billions of people living in rural areas, remote locations, or low-middle-income countries, the unavailability of quality medical care is a stark reality of everyday life. Providing access to medical care for these patients is a gaping hole in health systems across the globe. Additionally, millions of patients living with chronic diseases require regular follow-ups, health assessments, close monitoring, and continuous disease management. Even though living amidst quality healthcare, disease management requires significant effort and cost due to treatment-related visits. Telemedicine or telehealth can help to fill these gaps and reduce the burden on healthcare services. Telemedicine: Healthcare a call away! If you can\u2019t go to the doctor, maybe a doctor can come to you? Not literally, but through your telephone! Telemedicine is defined as the practice of providing medical service via information and communication technology, regardless of the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 geographical distance from one another. This includes health services like medical consultations, health assessments, refills, monitoring vitals, and rehabilitation. It allows optimum usage of healthcare facilities without overburdening them and better physician and far-off patient connectivity enhancing treatment compliance1,6.

Pharmacists who used telehealth methods to follow up with their patient have noticed an increase in medication adherence. Methods: Using PubMed and EBSCO secondary databases, inclusion criteria were any peer-reviewed study design such as randomized controlled trials, literature reviews, systematic reviews, and cohort studies published within the last 10 years. Search terms included pharmacist, telemedicine, telehealth, cardiovascular disease, and medication adherence. Results: Seventeen articles were reviewed. Most pharmacist interventions for patients with hypertension involving telemedicine, E-Health, or remote monitoring were performed in the outpatient setting. The primary target of most studies consisted of improving medication adherence. Conclusion: Pharmacist services play an integral role in maintaining medication adherence among the hypertensive population. Telehealth is an effective method of communication with patients to ensure their health is maintained, minimizing barriers of access to care. Keywords: T",

Abstract Due to rapid technological advancements, remote patient monitoring (RPM) technology has gained traction in recent years. While the effects of specific RPM interventions are known, few published reviews examine RPM in the context of care transitions from an inpatient hospital setting to a home environment. In this systematic review, we addressed this gap by examining the impacts of RPM interventions on patient safety, adherence, clinical and quality of life outcomes and cost-related ",

A new set of technological approaches in medication adherence monitoring can potentially yield valuable data within an LHS, and raises the question of the scope and limitations of patients' responsibilities to use them. We argue here that, in principle, it is plausible to suggest that patients have a prima facie obligation to use novel adherence monitors. However, the strength of the obligations depends considerably on the extent to which data that adherence monitors generate are, in fact, used to further the goals of LHSs. The way in which data ownership is structured in the USA poses a considerable challenge here, while the European Union framework offers a more promising alternative.

These situations may arise occasionally in our lives. Still, for billions of people living in rural areas, remote locations, or low-middle-income countries, the unavailability of quality medical care is a stark reality of everyday life. Providing access to medical care for these patients is a gaping hole in health systems across the globe. Additionally, millions of patients living with chronic diseases require regular follow-ups, health assessments, close monitoring, and continuous disease management. Even though living amidst quality healthcare, disease management requires significant effort and cost due to treatment-related visits. Telemedicine or telehealth can help to fill these gaps and reduce the burden on healthcare services. Telemedicine: Healthcare a call away! If you can\u2019t go to the doctor, maybe a doctor can come to you? Not literally, but through your telephone! Telemedicine is defined as the practice of providing medical service via information and communication technology, regardless of the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 geographical distance from one another. This includes health services like medical consultations, health assessments, refills, monitoring vitals, and rehabilitation. It allows optimum usage of healthcare facilities without overburdening them and better physician and far-off patient connectivity enhancing treatment compliance1,6. Telemedicine services were available for somtime but were brought to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided a perfect background for the successful implementation and popularization of telemedicine2,3,6.

The selection criteria required that articles be randomized controlled trials involving outpatient adults diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia; that they involve telemedicine interventions; and that they include an outcome of medication adherence. Initially, 1 author identified relevant titles. Two authors independently reviewed the abstracts and titles. Results Of 512 articles identified through database searching, we identified 17 articles that we categorized by intensity of intervention and rated by quality of evidence. There were 3 low-, 3 medium- and 11 high-intensity interventions. The most common type of technology used was the phone. Efficacy for adherence was demonstrated by 9 studies. Conclusions Telemedicine may improve medication adherence in patients with depression, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia. Future studies are needed to better understand how technology can be tailored to different types of nonadherence. Introduction Nonadherence ",

Abstract Background and aims: Common Mental Disorders (CMD) emerged as a substantial global burden, emphasizing the necessity of investigating effective treatment modalities, particularly in telemedicine. This umbrella review and meta-meta-analysis systematically evaluated telemedicine's effectiveness for CMD. Methods Key databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library) were searched for telemedicine interventions targeting CMD, including depression and anxiety. The interventions included video conferencing, mobile applications, remote monitoring, and other communication technologies. Multiple subgroup analyses were conducted based on diverse outcomes, populations, and severity levels to gauge real-world effectiveness. The study, registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023452382), began in October 2022, with analysis from June to August 2023 and an update in April 2024. Results The umbrella review included 191 systematic reviews, and the meta-meta-analysis incorporated 72 meta-analyses, assessed for quality using t",

Pharmacists who used telehealth methods to follow up with their patient have noticed an increase in medication adherence. Methods: Using PubMed and EBSCO secondary databases, inclusion criteria were any peer-reviewed study design such as randomized controlled trials, literature reviews, systematic reviews, and cohort studies published within the last 10 years. Search terms included pharmacist, telemedicine, telehealth, cardiovascular disease, and medication adherence. Results: Seventeen articles were reviewed. Most pharmacist interventions for patients with hypertension involving telemedicine, E-Health, or remote monitoring were performed in the outpatient setting. The primary target of most studies consisted of improving medication adherence. Conclusion: Pharmacist services play an integral role in maintaining medication adherence among the hypertensive population.

ABSTRACT Objective: To determine the health care cost savings from the Wellth app, a mobile health intervention that uses financial incentives to increase medication adherence. Study Design: An observational study of members in one of Arizona\u2019s Medicaid managed care plans, part of Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System (AHCCCS), using the Wellth app from March 28, 2020, to January 12, 2021. One-to-one matching was used to identify comparable nonparticipants, and a difference-in-differences approach was used to estimate the impact of the Wellth intervention on outcomes defined over the 9 months before and after using Wellth. Methods: An AHCCCS managed care health plan provided claims data that contained drug prescription, health care utilization, and health care cost information for all participants, and Wellth provided app usage data and contextual information about the Wellth intervention. Results: On average, the Wellth intervention increased medication adherence by 5.0 percentage points (95% CI, 2.9-7.1;\u00a0P\u2009= .008) and reduced emergency department (\u20130.02; 95% CI, \u20130.03 to \u20130.01; P\u2009=\u2009.002), inpatient (\u20130.04; 95% CI, \u20130.06 to \u20130.02; P\u2009=\u2009.001), and mental health clinic (\u20130.06; 95%\u00a0CI, \u20130.10 to \u20130.01; P\u2009=\u2009.013) visits relative to nonparticipants over 9 months.

Abstract Background The virulent and unpredictable nature of COVID-19 combined with a change in reimbursement mechanisms both forced and enabled the rapid adoption of telemedicine around the world. Thus, it is important to now assess the effects of this rapid adoption and to determine whether the barriers to such adoption are the same today as they were under prepandemic conditions. Objective The objective of this systematic literature review was to examine the research literature published during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify facilitators, barriers, and associated medical outcomes as a result of adopting telemedicine, and to determine if changes have occurred in the industry during this time.

These situations may arise occasionally in our lives. Still, for billions of people living in rural areas, remote locations, or low-middle-income countries, the unavailability of quality medical care is a stark reality of everyday life. Providing access to medical care for these patients is a gaping hole in health systems across the globe. Additionally, millions of patients living with chronic diseases require regular follow-ups, health assessments, close monitoring, and continuous disease management. Even though living amidst quality healthcare, disease management requires significant effort and cost due to treatment-related visits. Telemedicine or telehealth can help to fill these gaps and reduce the burden on healthcare services. Telemedicine: Healthcare a call away! If you can\u2019t go to the doctor, maybe a doctor can come to you? Not literally, but through your telephone! Telemedicine is defined as the practice of providing medical service via information and communication technology, regardless of the patients\u2019 and doctors\u2019 geographical distance from one another. This includes health services like medical consultations, health assessments, refills, monitoring vitals, and rehabilitation. It allows optimum usage of healthcare facilities without overburdening them and better physician and far-off patient connectivity enhancing treatment compliance1,6. Telemedicine services were available for somtime but were brought to the forefront during the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided a perfect background for the successful implementation and popularization of telemedicine2,3,6.

This practice has been around almost as long as telephones but has become more popular and practical during the COVID-19 pandemic. Improvements in technology and changes to insurance reimbursement rulings have helped increase the acceptance of telemedicine. Without it, doctors and therapists wouldn\u2019t be able to connect with patients as easily, especially during the pandemic. As telemedicine has become widespread, professionals and patients have grown more comfortable connecting virtually. Benefits Telemedicine isn\u2019t meant to take the place of face-to-face visits. While it does have some disadvantages, which we\u2019ll get into later, its benefits are undeniable. They include: 1. Easy access to specialists Not everyone has an ongoing relationship with a doctor they can call when they need one. Many online medical networks offer round-the-clock access to all kinds of specialists, without an appointment, at any time of day or night. 2. Lower cost Doctors and therapists can be expensive, even for people with good health insurance. Telemedicine appointments typically cost less than in-person visits do. This reduces out-of-pocket costs, removing a barrier to care. 3. Medical access for people without health insurance Not having adequate health insurance can be an obstacle to seeing a doctor. Many online companies provide cash-pay telemedicine, which doesn\u2019t require health insurance or referrals. 4. Medical access for people in rural areas Country living has many benefits, but fast access to medical care isn\u2019t always one of them. For people who live many miles from the nearest medical facility, telemedicine provides a way to meet with a doctor quickly. This saves time and allows people to stay off the road when driving conditions are less than optimal, such as during a snowstorm or hailstorm. 5.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

Abstract Background Telemedicine and remote patient monitoring have emerged as transformative solutions in contemporary healthcare. This study aimed to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of these technologies on healthcare delivery, focusing on patient outcomes, economic parameters, and overall satisfaction. Methods A prospective observational study was conducted in various healthcare facilities, involving 186 participants with chronic diseases. Inclusion criteria included patients actively using telemedicine services. Data collection methods included surveys, interviews, and review of medical records, focusing on patient demographics, clinical outcomes, and economic parameters. The intervention involved a seamless integration of telemedicine technologies into the existing health system. Results Primary outcomes revealed significant improvements in patient health, including a decrease in disease-specific markers (mean reduction of 12,000 to 11,000, p = 0.00",

Honestly, I found it difficult at first to establish an effective rapport with patients using telehealth, especially for new patient consults. Many physicians report difficulty making the transition to virtual patient encounters. The learning curve was more than I had expected, and my first few telehealth visits seemed disengaged and sterile. Not to mention having to deal with technical problems. In response, I looked for resources about making meaningful connections with patients, despite the loss of physical presence. I also looked at how to apply the basics of patient-centered communication to this new digital platform. As it turns out, you can learn techniques to become more comfortable and improve your \u2018web-side manner.\u2019 It helps to be familiar with the equipment and technology. Although I\u2019m far from being an IT expert, I now have a better understanding of how the system works, including how to troubleshoot common problems. Doing a test run with your office staff before starting with a patient is a good idea for those of us entirely new to telehealth. You may want to have someone available during the virtual visit who can provide (or obtain) additional tech support if needed. Having alternative options to reach the patient (e.g., phone, email, text) in case something goes down also proved essential. It is also important to assess the patient\u2019s familiarity with telehealth and provide orientation as needed before the virtual encounter. Explain why yo",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Patient acceptance is imperative to successful telemedicine implementation. As telemedicine utilization continues to surge, it is imperative that healthcare organizations have a method for evaluating the patient experience with these types of visits. Previous studies on experience with telemedicine have focused on smaller patient populations with narrow inclusion criteria and limited geographical reach. This research described how patients\u2019 satisfaction with video telemedicine-based visits varied based on patient characteristics and how they compare with in-person visits. We obtained and analyzed results from standardized patient experience surveys to compare telemedicine and in-person clinic visits during the COVID-19 pandemic (between July 1, 2020, and June 30, 2021) across a diverse patient population. During the study timeframe, surveys were sent to 1,521,398 patients with a response rate of 20% (307,185). Our organization\u2019s unique structure, size, and geographic spread allowed for a deeper and more comprehensive examination of telemedicine participants. Though a few trends emerged in the results, there were no significant differences in patient ratings of telemedicine visits and in-person clinic visits during the same period (p=0.672). This study demonstrated that patient satisfaction with telemedicine visits was non-inferior to in-person outpatient visits during the study timeframe.

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract Telemedicine is a convenient tool for providing medical care remotely. It is routinely offered as an alternative to face-to-face consultations in healthcare settings all over the world. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and increased use of telemedicine in everyday clinical practice, the effectiveness of this modality and patient satisfaction with telemedicine is a subject of growing concern. PubMed and Google Scholar databases were searched. Papers published between January 2020 and August 2021 which met inclusion and exclusion criteria were analyzed. During the COVID-19 pandemic patients have found telemedicine a beneficial tool for consulting healthcare providers. A high level of satisfaction with telehealth was observed in each study across every medical specialty. Telemedicine is undoubtedly a convenient tool that has helped ensure continuity of medical care during the COVID-19 pandemic thanks to its considerable potential. In particular situations, telehealth may adequately replace face-to-face consultation. Regular patients\u2019 feedback is necessary to improve the use of telemedicine in the future. Keywords: tele",

Logistic regression models were employed to assess the association between type of visit (in-person/telehealth) and patient satisfaction (satisfied/unsatisfied) while accounting for sociodemographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Of the 247,087 surveys included in the study, 86,580 (35%) were answered following telehealth visits. Telehealth visitors were more satisfied than in-person visitors in aspects related to doctor-patient interactions, such as \"courtesy and respect,\" \"attentive listening,\" and \"coherent explanations\" (aOR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.14-1.21; aOR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.12-1.19; aOR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.12-1.18, respectively), and less satisfied in aspects related to indirect services, such as adherence to appointment scheduling, effort required on the pa",

It may involve a telephone call, a video call, or some other form of remote patient monitoring. The modern form of telemedicine began in the 1950s when some hospital systems began to share information over the telephone. It connected doctors and specialists who worked with the same patients. With the rise of the internet, however, the practice of telemedicine has evolved into an experience that is very similar to what a visit to a local doctor\u2019s office entails. Telemedicine should not be confused with telehealth, as it refers specifically to remote clinical services being provided. Here are the pros and cons of telemedicine to consider. List of the Pros of Telemedicine 1. It is more convenient for patients. How often have you been forced to sit in a waiting room for a doctor\u2019s visit? Then how long did you stay in the exam room, waiting for the doctor to arrive? Modern medicine, especially in the United States, is incredibly inconvenient. With telemedicine, on-demand care can be provided without as much time being wasted. For individuals who live in very rural areas, are home-bound, or cannot get away from their responsibilities, it is an opportunity to have basic medical needs met without as much sacrifice. 2. It saves doctors a lot money. Telemedicine is often a lot cheaper than a traditional visit to the doctor for an examination. The America Hospital Association reports that the average telemedicine program in the United States saves 11% and triples the return on investment for those who are involved. That is because there are fewer no-shows which happen through telemedicine. It also turns the on-call time for a doctor into potential billable ho",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

In this review, we examined studies published within the past five years that investigated the impact of telemedicine on patient satisfaction. Methods: Four investigators utilized PubMed and Google Scholar to find studies published within the past five years that assessed patient satisfaction with telemedicine in the field of adult primary care, using either the Press Ganey or CAHPS surveys. Studies that compared cost and quality of care between telemedicine and in-patient healthcare were also included to address the secondary aims of this study. Results: A total of 11 studies out of the 405 that were investigated were selected for this review. Five studies found no significant difference in patient satisfaction between telemedicine and in-person medicine, with one of those showing a patient preference for telemedicine.

During the pandemic, medical centers, including Yale, rapidly developed telehealth programs in order to reduce exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19. Experts predict that telehealth will remain part of the health care system even after the COVID risk falls. Beyond reducing the risk of catching something at the doctor\u2019s office, telehealth eliminates the need to travel there. It is, in a word, convenient. But there may be tradeoffs between convenience and quality when telehealth replaces in-person visits, caution Sarah Hull, MD, MBE, assistant professor of medicine (cardiology) and associate director of the Yale School of Medicine\u2019s Program for Biomedical Ethics, and colleagues in a paper published September 30, 2022 in the Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine. In the paper, Hull and fellow Yale cardiologists explore these tradeoffs, as well as concerns about health care disparities and unintended consequences that can arise from the use of telehealth. The authors also suggest practices the medical community can use to get the most from telehealth. Trading Quality for Convenience Telehealth has limitations. As the authors note in the paper, \u201cthere may be tradeoffs for convenience, wherein the absence of a physical exam or an overlooked nuance in non-verbal communication may result in a missed diagnosis.\u201d Patient surveys have reported that patients perceive in-person visits to be more thorough than telehealth appointments. Distributive Justice and Unintended Consequences While telehealth is often touted for increasing access to health care and reducing health care disparities, it has the potential to exacerbate inequity, the authors note. If people who previously had little access to health care start using telehealth\u2014and telehealth is of lower quality than in-person medical care--then the shift to telehealth doesn\u2019t",

Telemedicine, a subset of telehealth, is defined as the distribution of health-related information between a provider and patient via telecommunication technologies. While telehealth refers to remote nonclinical services, telemedicine refers to remote clinical services. The major goal of telemedicine is to improve a patient\u2019s clinical health status. Telemedicine requires audio and visual components and can be provided either in real time as live, two-way audiovisual interactions between patients and providers (synchronous telemedicine) or by storing and forwarding data and images for use at a different time (asynchronous telemedicine).1 Recently, telemedicine has gained popularity with patients due to ease of use, decreased cost, and decreased travel time. However, it also has several limitations, which will be discussed later.1 Before a telemedicine visit, providers should anticipate and manage patient expectations, and ensure that the technology required for a successful telemedicine visit is working and accessible. Key points include confirming technological requirements, obtaining consent, discussing reimbursement and copay responsibilities, and discussing privacy expectations.2 Since its first appearance in the late 1950s, telemedicine has contributed to seniors having the choice to age at home. In addition, patients residing in rural areas who previously had difficulties accessing a physician can reach physicians virtually.2 Modern technology has enabled physicians to consult patients through HIPAA-compliant videoconferencing tools, providing care, advice, reminders, education, intervention, monitoring, and remote admissions to their p",

Abstract The extensive uptake of telehealth has considerably transformed health care delivery since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and has imposed tremendous challenges to its large-scale implementation and adaptation. Given the shift in paradigm from telehealth as an alternative mechanism of care delivery to telehealth as an integral part of the health system, it is imperative to take a systematic approach to identifying barriers to, opportunities for, and the overall impact of telehealth implementation amidst the current pandemic.

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Affiliation How Satisfied Are Patients and Surgeons with Telemedicine in Orthopaedic Care During the COVID-19 Pandemic? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Authors Affiliation Abstract Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic has resulted in a rapid pivot toward telemedicine owing to closure of in-person elective clinics and sustained efforts at physical distancing worldwide. Throughout this period, there has been revived enthusiasm for delivering and receiving orthopaedic care remotely. Unfortunately, rapidly published editorials and commentaries during the pandemic have not adequately conveyed findings of published randomized trials on this topic. Questions/purposes: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials, we asked: (1) What are the levels of patient and surgeon satisfaction with the use of telemedicine as a tool for orthopaedic care delivery? (2) Are there differences in patient-reported outcomes between telemedicine visits and in-person visits? (3) What is the difference in time commitment between telemedicine and in-person visits? Methods: In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a systematic review with the primary objective to determine patient and surgeon satisfact",

These permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Abstract Purpose of Review The purpose of this review is to describe the determinants of satisfaction with telemedicine (TM) and how they compare with in-person visits from both the perspective of patients and of providers. Recent Findings The use of TM will expand only if patients and providers are at least as satisfied with it as they are with in-person visits. Since deviations from expected care can result in reduced satisfaction regardless of the quality of the visit or objective medical outcomes, it is important to understand and to help form those expectations when possible. Patients consistently report 95\u2013100% satisfaction rate with TM when compared with in-person appointments. They tend to cite the convenience of decreased travel times and costs as the main drivers for satisfaction with TM. Providers tend to be satisfied with TM if they have input into its development, there is administrative support, the technology is reliable and easy to use, and if there is adequate reimbursement for its use. Summary Satisfaction with TM is necessary for adoption of this new technology. To improve satisfaction it is important to consider factors that dri",

Patient satisfaction is a critical aspect of implementing telemedicine, but we have no comprehensive understanding of satisfaction levels and the associated factors. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess patient satisfaction related to telemedicine consultations and to identify key factors influencing satisfaction levels. Results: The search yielded a total of 147 cross-sectional studies, of which 107 met the criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis. Overall, patient satisfaction with teleconsultations was found to be high, with satisfaction levels ranging from 38 to 100 on a scale of 0 to 100. Only a small percentage (2.72%) of the studies reported satisfaction levels below 75%. Surprisingly, most studies used nonvalidated satisfaction questionnaires, which highlight the need for the development of standardized measurement instruments. Conclusions: This systematic review and meta-analysis provide evidence that patients generally exhibit high levels of satisfaction with telemedicin",

This study, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic across various medical specialties, underscores telemedicine's potential. Moreover, addressing the digital divide through initiatives like broadband expansion and digital literacy training can further enhance access, transforming telemedicine into a powerful tool for health equity.  The focus should be on bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to telemedicine, rather than abandoning a technology with the potential to significantly improve healthcare for underserved populations.

The federal government expanded telemedicine coverage to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on ambulatory services, which may provide an opportunity to improve access to care. This study aims to examine differences in telemedicine use for ambulatory services by race, ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status among community-dwelling older adults with ADRD. Methods: This retrospective cohort study used Medicare claims data between April 01, 2020 and December 31, 2021. We included community-dwelling Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries aged 65 years and older with ADRD. The outcome variable is individual's use (yes/no) of telemedicine evaluation and management (tele-EM) visits in each quarter. The key independent variables are race, ethnicity, and community-level socioeconomic status. Results: The analytical sample size of the study was 2,068,937, including 9.9% Black, 82.7% White, and 7.4% Hispanic individuals.

Keywords: telehealth, disparities, COVID-19 INTRODUCTION Rapid implementation of telehealth became a hallmark of our healthcare system\u2019s response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has demonstrated feasibility and efficacy in the care of older adults including vulnerable homebound populations.1,2 Implementation of telehealth was facilitated by both relaxation of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) allowing the use of non-HIPAA compliant platforms for video visits, as well as a temporary increase in reimbursement rates for telehealth for Medicare and Medicaid patients.3,4 Emerging evidence suggests, however, that minority populations face substantial barriers to telehealth including lack of familiarity with technology, lower health and digital literacy, sensory impairments, lack of broadband access, and lack of assistance.5\u201310 Given the widespread implementation of telehealth",

We sought to determine, in a population-based sample, how many Americans were using computers and the internet before the pandemic, and whether disparities existed in this. Methods The National Health Interview Survey is conducted annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and is representative of the entire United States civilian non-institutionalized population. In 2018, questions were fielded regarding computer and web utilization. We evaluated sociodemographic factors associated with this. Results Twenty-five thousand and forty-nine people, representing 245,842,992 in the population, responded to these questions. Of the responses, 19% stated they used a computer \u201cnever or almost never,\u201d 18% stated they did not use the internet, and 25% did not use email. Over the previous 12 months, 55% of responders stated they had looked up health information on the internet, 11% had filled a prescription online, 16% had scheduled a medical appointment on the internet, and 17% had communicated with a healthcare provider by email. Internet usage varied by region, age, race, education, family income, and insurance status, but not by gender.

Abstract Background \u2003The COVID-19 pandemic led to dramatic increases in telemedicine use to provide outpatient care without in-person contact risks. Telemedicine increases options for health care access, but a \u201cdigital divide\u201d of disparate access may prevent certain populations from realizing the benefits of telemedicine. Objectives \u2003The study aimed to understand telemedicine utilization patterns after a widespread deployment to identify potential disparities exacerbated by expanded telemedicine usage. Methods \u2003We performed a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of adults who scheduled outpatient visits between June 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 at a single-integrated academic health system encompassing a broad range of subspecialties and a large geographic region in the Upper Midwest, during a period of time after the initial surge of COVID-19 when most standard clinical services had resumed.

This is an Open Access article: verbatim copying and redistribution of this article are permitted in all media for any purpose Abstract Accelerated use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled uninterrupted healthcare delivery while unmasking care disparities for several vulnerable communities. The social determinants of health (SDOH) serve as a critical model for understanding how the circumstances in which people are born, work, and live impact health outcomes. We performed semi-structured interviews to understand patients and providers\u2019 experiences with telemedicine encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a deductive approach, we applied the SDOH to determine telemedicine\u2019s role and impact within this framework. Overall, patient and provider interviews supported the use of existing SDOH domains to describe disparities in Internet access and telemedicine use, rather than reframing technology as a sixth SDOH. In order to mitigate the digital divide, we identify and propose solutions that address SDOH-related barriers that shape the use of health information technologies.

Loading Minimizing Telehealth Technology Barriers in Rural and Underserved Communities Telehealth services are uniquely suited to rural and underserved communities. The universal benefits of improving access to care by eliminating travel time, limiting time off work, connecting with specialists and addressing a shortage of health care workers can transform health care delivery in a community. While various barriers exist that can prevent communities from accessing telehealth services \u2013 including identifying and scheduling interpreters when there are language barriers \u2013 the technology barrier is a critical one as it blocks telehealth options for patient care altogether. By addressing technology-related barriers, you can begin to break through. The first step is to stay consistent with the family-centered care approach by partnering with families/caregivers and working together towards solutions. Here are practical ideas to help pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists, pediatric surgical specialists and non-physician clinicians who serve in rural and underserved communities overcome four common technology-related telehealth barriers. Barrier: Access to Technology Some families/caregivers may not have computers, laptops, tablets or smartphones. While telehealth may seem impossible in these cases, there are creative ways to get the technology to the people or vice versa. It\u2019s important to start from the famil",

Abstract A growing body of evidence suggests that digital literacy is an important barrier constraining adoption and use of Internet and digital technologies in the developing world. By enabling people to effectively find valuable information online, digital literacy can play a crucial role in expanding economic opportunities, thereby leading to human development and poverty reduction. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of validated survey measures for capturing digital literacy of populations who have limited prior exposure to technology. We present a novel approach for measuring digital literacy of low literacy and new Internet users, an important segment of users in developing countries. Using a sample of 143 social media users in Pakistan, which includes a significant fraction of low literacy individuals, we measure digital literacy by observing the effectiveness of participants in completing a series of tasks and by recording a set of self-reported survey responses. We then use machine learning methods (e.g., Random Forest) to identify a parsimonious set of survey questions that are most predictive of ground truth digital l",

Digital literacy goes beyond basic computer skills; it encompasses the ability to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information using digital tools. Unfortunately, underserved communities often face significant digital literacy gaps, hindering their ability to access educational resources, job opportunities, and essential services. At Tricef, we are committed to bridging these gaps and empowering individuals through targeted digital literacy initiatives. Understanding the Digital Literacy Gap Defining Digital Literacy Digital literacy involves more than just the ability to use a computer or smartphone. It includes a range of skills: The Impact of Digital Literacy Gaps Educational Disparities Underserved communities often lack access to digital resources, leading to significant educational disparities. According to a study by the Pew Research Center, about 35% of lower-income households with school-aged children do not have a high-speed internet connection at home, making remote learning challenging (Pew Research Center, 2021). Economic Inequality The lack of digital skills can limit job opportunities and career advancement. The World Economic Forum reports that digital skills are increasingly required across various industries, and those without these skills are at a significant disadvantage in the job market (World Economic Forum, 2020). Social Exclusion Digital literacy is also crucial for social inclusion. Individuals who lack digital skills may struggle to access essential services, stay informed, and participate fully in society. This exclusion can perpetuate cycles of poverty and marginalization.

Yet, despite the federal government having invested roughly $85 billion in pursuit of this goal just in the past 13 years, along with millions more from state governments, the US does not have universal access and the digital divide\u2014the gaps in access to and use of the internet and other information technologies between certain groups of people\u2014persists. This shortfall in access is, in part, due to a key distinction between availability and adoption (see the list of terms and definitions below). Availability refers to broadband service being offered in a local community, while adoption is the rate of residential subscribership to high-speed internet access. So, while many people have service in their area that does not mean, for example, that that service is affordable to them. With another $65 billion being allo",

Abstract Having adequate access to the internet at home enhances quality-of-life for households and facilitates economic and social opportunities. Despite increased investment in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of households in the rural United States still lack adequate access to high-speed internet. In this study, we evaluate a wireless broadband network deployed in Turney, a small, underserved rural community in northwest Missouri. In addition to collecting survey data before and after this internet intervention, we collected pre-treatment and post-treatment survey data from comparison communities to serve as a control group. Due to technical constraints, some of Turney's interested participants could not connect to the network, creating an additional comparison group. These comparisons suggest two primary findings, (1) changes in using the internet for employment, education, and health could not be directly attributed to the internet intervention, and (2) the internet intervention was associated with benefits stemming from the ability to use multiple devices at once.

Abstract While the rapid expansion of telemedicine in response to the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the impressive ability of health systems to adapt quickly to new complexities, it also raises important concerns about how to implement these novel modalities equitably. As the healthcare system becomes increasingly virtual, it risks widening disparities among marginalized populations who have worse health outcomes at baseline and limited access to the resources necessary for the effective use of telemedicine. In this article, we review recent policy changes and outline important recommendations that governments and health care systems can adopt to improve access to telemedicine and to tailor the use of these technologies to best meet the needs of underserved patients. We suggest that by making health equity integral to the implementation of telemedicine now, it will help to ensure that all can benefit from its use going forward and that this will be increasingly integral to care delivery.

This healthcare divide is influenced by multiple factors, with one of the most significant being limited broadband access. In rural regions, poor internet connectivity hampers the ability to utilise telehealth services effectively, worsening existing health disparities. Combined with a shortage of healthcare professionals and long travel distances for speciality care, rural populations face significant barriers to receiving timely, high-quality healthcare. However, telehealth holds the potential to bridge these gaps, offering a promising solution to improve healthcare access for underserved communities. The Digital Divide in Rural Healthcare One of the critical challenges facing rural healthcare is the lack of broadband access. Telehealth services, which rely on stable, high-speed internet, are often inaccessible to rural populations due to poor infrastructure. This digital divide creates barriers to crucial telehealth applications such as video-based consultations, remote monitoring, and the use of integrated medical devices. These telehealth services are essential for managing chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer, which are more prevalent in rural communities compared to urban areas. Unfortunately, these services cannot be fully utilised without reliable internet, leaving many rural residents with limited options for timely medical care. Improving broadband connectivity in rural regions is a fundamental step toward making telehealth a viable solution. Governments and private organisations increasingly recognise the need to invest in digital infrastructure to close this gap. As telehealth continues to advance, scalable solutions integrating multiple specialities and user-friendly platforms could provide rural patients with access to healthcare services that were",

By Bill Siwicki January 02, 2025 11:48 AM Oren Nissim, CEO and cofounder of Brook Health Photo: Oren Nissim The promise of remote patient monitoring is showing itself in more and more telemedicine use cases, with huge potential for day-to-day wellness, management of chronic conditions and the promotion of health equity. Oren Nissim is CEO and cofounder of Brook Health, a care management company that uses telehealth and artificial intelligence for home-based care. He sees big things for RPM in 2025, helping across a variety of important areas for patients where they live. We spoke with him about the trends he sees shaping up for the year ahead. Q. You predict big things for congestive heart failure and remote patient monitoring this year. What do you see happening? A. 2025 will transform congestive heart failure management as healthcare organizations recognize that traditional episodic care models can't effectively manage the growing CHF population. Remote patient monitoring will mature beyond simple vital sign tracking to become an intelligent early warning system that combines real-time physiological data with AI-driven pattern recognition to detect subtle signs of deterioration days before serious symptoms emerge. The integration of AI-powered monitoring with human care teams will enable a new standard of proactive CHF management. Healthcare organizations ",

Abstract Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a large increase in telemedicine encounters. Despite this rise in virtual visits, patients who speak non-English languages have experienced challenges accessing telemedicine. To improve health equity, medical education on telehealth delivery should include instruction on working with interpreters in telehealth. Methods We developed a 25-minute self-directed module with collective expertise of faculty with experience in medical education, interpreter training, and communication training. The module was delivered online as part of a longitudinal health equity curriculum for third-year medical students. In addition to didactic information, the module contained video examples of interpreter interactions in telehealth. Results Sixty-four third-year medical students participated in the study, and 60 completed a postmodule survey. Students were satisfied with the content of the module, as well as the duration of time required to complete the tasks. Approximately 90% would recommend it to future students. Nearly 80% of students rated the module as",

The reasons for concern are outlined, with over 14 million people lacking basic English skills, leading to limited access to healthcare and poorer health outcomes for non-English-speaking individuals. As the number of such patients is projected to increase in the US, finding innovative solutions to facilitate communication between clinicians and patients becomes essential. The briefing is organized in collaboration with Stanford CARE and features notable speakers, including Dr. Latha Palaniappan, Co-Founder of Stanford CARE; Dr. Ingrid J. Hall from the Division of Cancer Prevention and Control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and Dr. Elena V. Rios, President & CEO of the National Hispanic Medical Association. Dr. Palaniappan began the discussion by emphasizing language barriers as a significant social determinant of health. Language barriers occur when healthcare providers and patients do not share a native language. While some doctors may claim language proficiency on their websites, they may not be proficient in medical terms, leading to potential misunderstandings and challenges in providing adequate care. The presentation highlights the adverse impacts of language barriers on patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). LEP populations face exacerbated health disparities due to factors such as inadequate access to translation services, less health education, worse interpersonal care, and lower patient satisfaction. These challenges lead to increased healthcare costs and delayed or undiagnosed conditions. Dr. Palaniappan further delves into the racial and ethnic diversity in America, illustrating the growing number of non-English speakers in the country. The most common langua",

One of the clinics serves a primarily Spanish-speaking population, and the second serves a primarily Chinese-speaking population. Neither had offered video or phone visits before the pandemic started.

Share this item with your network: By Anuja Vaidya, Senior Editor Published: 29 Dec 2022 The benefits that telehealth adoption and use can provide patients are well-documented. From increasing healthcare access to reducing exposure to infectious diseases to enhancing convenience, the patient care benefits of telehealth are myriad. As a result, though telehealth use has leveled off since its peak in 2020, usage has stabilized at higher rates than before the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, under 2 percent of patients used telehealth only or a mix of telehealth and in-person care services, according to data from market research firm Trilliant Health. That figure rose to about 28 percent in 2020 and dropped to 19 percent in the first and second quarters of 2022. But even with telehealth remaining a popular mode of care delivery, the pandemic threw into sharp relief the hurdles facing certain patients when trying to access virtual care. These relate to various social determinants of health (SDOH), ranging from race- and age-related barriers to the digital divide to having limited English proficiency (LEP).

In fact, it is highly relevant to telemedicine, which has the power to either exacerbate or reduce healthcare disparities.\u00a0 Download our 5-item checklist on Cultural Competency in Telemedicine. What is telemedicine? Virtual healthcare, also called telemedicine or telehealth, refers to using electronic communication technologies to facilitate remote clinical healthcare, patient education, and healthcare administration. Telemedicine is a growing movement that is beginning to influence the healthcare industry and patient experience. Long touted as an effective way to reach rural patients, telemedicine exploded into the mainstream at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. The use of telemedicine peaked in April 2020, when\u00a069% of doctor-patient visits\u00a0were conducted virtually. While usage has fallen since then, approximately\u00a026.7 million Americans used telemedicine in 2022, and 80% of doctors now provide telehealth services.\u00a0 Live video conferencing is the telehealth technology most relevant to the practice of cultural competency, and most of our tips and information about telemedicine refer to live video interactions between providers and patients. \u00a0 Telemedicine and health disparities The number of\u00a0people using telemedicine\u00a0rises with education and income levels.\u00a0Studies have shown\u00a0that older people, African Americans, Hispanic/Latinos, and non-English speakers are less likely to complete a telemedicine appointment via video. Telehealth could worsen existing health disparities due to a lack of smartphone ownership, a lack of a private space to conduct a telemedicine visit, data privacy concerns, or less technical knowledge. However, there is also evidence that\u00a0telemedicine reduces provider bias, which can contribute to healthcare disparities. An analysis of Covid-19 ",

Telepsychiatry and telebehavioral health improve access to care, yet mobile health technologies may have even more promise. A scoping review examined the research question: \u201cWhat are the components of culturally competent, mobile health care, and what approaches have clinicians and systems taken to implement this care, train clinicians and evaluate outcomes?\u201d The literature search from January 2000 to March 2020 focused on keywords in four concept areas: (1) competencies; (2) mobile health; (3) culture; and (4) clinical care. Of 2471 papers, 183 papers were directly relevant to the concepts. Few studies and professional organizations\u2019 publications specifically discuss skills or competencies for mobile health and cultural factors. Existing telehealth competency sets (i.e., video, social media, mobile health, telebehavioral health, asynchronous) have limited cultural components, and one outline of culturally competencies exists without mention of technology. The landscape of culturally competence is expanded with cultural humility and safety constructs. New sets of mobile health and cultural competencies were constructed\u2014with integra",

With continued support from government legislation, telemedicine can bridge the gap in patient care access. As we navigate a labor shortage, telemedicine provides an equitable future for providers and patients alike. Physician shortages are an increasing problem in the United States healthcare system. According to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply.(1) Specifically, aging and population growth are major drivers of the increasing demand for physician services. Hospitals, clinics, and independent healthcare providers are feeling the pressures of this as the labor market is decreasing year over year. Figure 1 provides a great visualization of this issue.(2) Figure 1. Projected supply gap in U.S. physicians from 2017 to 2030 (upper estimate). Amid a physician shortage, telemedicine has played a significant role in providing access to care. The adoption of telemedicine accelerated rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the need to reduce in-person interactions necessitating healthcare providers and patients to turn to telemedicine as a safe and efficient alternative for non-emergency medical consultations. It has been an impactful aid during the most significant medical crisis of the 21st century. Accurately predicting the use of telemedicine in the future will be challenging.

Telemedicine has become a viable option for providing healthcare services to remote locations where access to medical care is limited thanks to the development of advanced communication technologies. The effectiveness of telemedicine in enhancing rural and underserved populations' access to healthcare is examined in this paper. The paper discusses telemedicine's benefits and drawbacks, adoption challenges, and potential effects on healthcare delivery in underserved areas.

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

This is an Open Access article: verbatim copying and redistribution of this article are permitted in all media for any purpose Abstract Accelerated use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled uninterrupted healthcare delivery while unmasking care disparities for several vulnerable communities. The social determinants of health (SDOH) serve as a critical model for understanding how the circumstances in which people are born, work, and live impact health outcomes. We performed semi-structured interviews to understand patients and providers\u2019 experiences with telemedicine encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a deductive approach, we applied the SDOH to determine telemedicine\u2019s role and impact within this framework. Overall, patient and provider interviews supported the use of existing SDOH domains to describe disparities in Internet access and telemedicine use, rather than reframing technology as a sixth SDOH. In order to mitigate the digital divide, we identify and propose solutions that address SDOH-related barriers that shape the use of health information technologies.

Telemedicine increases options for health care access, but a \"digital divide\" of disparate access may prevent certain populations from realizing the benefits of telemedicine. Objectives: The study aimed to understand telemedicine utilization patterns after a widespread deployment to identify potential disparities exacerbated by expanded telemedicine usage. Methods: We performed a cross-sectional retrospective analysis of adults who scheduled outpatient visits between June 1, 2020 and August 31, 2020 at a single-integrated academic health system encompassing a broad range of subspecialties and a large geographic region in the Upper Midwest, during a period of time after the initial surge of COVID-19 when most standard clinical services had resumed. At the beginning of this study period, approximately 72% of provider visits were telemedicine visits.

Short abstract Content available: Author Audio Recording Abbreviations hepatitis C virus intervention\u2010generated inequalities Listen to an audio presentation of this article. Telemedicine offers the opportunity to provide clinical services at a distance, thereby bridging geographic and other barriers to medical care. With the need to socially distance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic, clinical practices across the United States rapidly transitioned to telemedicine, which quickly became the predominant mode of outpatient care delivery. 1 , 2 While in\u2010person clinic visits will resume post\u2010pandemic, telemedicine will remain a major component to health\u2010care delivery as it fills gaps and satisfies patient needs in ways in\u2010person clinical visits cannot. 3 Yet, if the technology is not used equitably and uniformly adopted, the move toward telemedicine will exacerbate the deep underlying health\u2010care disparities exposed by the pandemic. People with limited digital literacy or who lack access to digital devices or reliable broadband Internet, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency have unique challenges accessing telemedicine. 4 It is critical that we identify barriers to telemedicine use and develop solutio",

With continued support from government legislation, telemedicine can bridge the gap in patient care access. As we navigate a labor shortage, telemedicine provides an equitable future for providers and patients alike. Physician shortages are an increasing problem in the United States healthcare system. According to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply.(1) Specifically, aging and population growth are major drivers of the increasing demand for physician services. Hospitals, clinics, and independent healthcare providers are feeling the pressures of this as the labor market is decreasing year over year. Figure 1 provides a great visualization of this issue.(2) Figure 1. Projected supply gap in U.S. physicians from 2017 to 2030 (upper estimate). Amid a physician shortage, telemedicine has played a significant role in providing access to care. The adoption of telemedicine accelerated rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the need to reduce in-person interactions necessitating healthcare providers and patients to turn to telemedicine as a safe and efficient alternative for non-emergency medical consultations. It has been an impactful aid during the most significant medical crisis of the 21st century. Accurately predicting the use of telemedicine in the future will be challenging.

How does it affect patients' health and well-being compared to the alternatives? How do costs compare? Are patients and clinicians satisfied with the services? Would they want to use them in the future? Why or why not? These are the kinds of questions that clinicians, patients, managers, and policymakers want answered about telemedicine. This chapter focuses on questions about the quality, accessibility, cost, and acceptability of telemedicine services. Additional questions will, however, be relevant for some organizations, some communities, and some evaluations. For example, because many telemedicine programs also serve educational and administrative purposes, evaluations may reasonably seek to assess results in these areas.

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

According to data from the Association of American Medical Colleges, the United States faces a projected physician shortage of up to 124,000 physicians by 2034, with demand for physicians outpacing supply.(1) Specifically, aging and population growth are major drivers of the increasing demand for physician services. Hospitals, clinics, and independent healthcare providers are feeling the pressures of this as the labor market is decreasing year over year. Figure 1 provides a great visualization of this issue.(2) Figure 1. Projected supply gap in U.S. physicians from 2017 to 2030 (upper estimate). Amid a physician shortage, telemedicine has played a significant role in providing access to care. The adoption of telemedicine accelerated rapidly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, with lockdowns, social distancing measures, and the need to reduce in-person interactions necessitating healthcare providers and patients to turn to telemedicine as a safe and efficient alternative for non-emergency medical consultations. It has been an impactful aid during the most significant medical crisis of the 21st century. Accurately predicting the use of telemedicine in the future will be challenging.

Abstract Telemedicine has traditionally been used in rural areas, but the recent development of mHealth solutions has led to a growth in urban telemedicine services. The aim of this study was to determine whether urban and rural patients in a large academic medical center use telemedicine to access different healthcare specialties at different rates. This retrospective cohort study examined all telemedicine visits dated 2008-2017 at a large academic medical center. Visits were classified by clinical specialty. Teledermatology, child telepsychiatry, and adult telepsychiatry made up 97 percent of telemedicine visits. Rural patients were more likely to have multiple telehealth visits. A significant difference was observed between rural and urban use of telemedicine, both in terms of specialties and demographics. This suggests that health systems should consider adjusting resources and training to meet the different needs of these two populations.

Introduction Estimates of the total U.S. population living in non-metropolitan (rural) counties vary from 46.2 million to 59 million people. This represents 14% to 19% of the U.S. population. A recent AAMC report (Warshaw, 2017) addresses some of the challenges of rural health and associated health disparities affecting millions in the U.S. Rural populations are culturally heterogeneous, are spread broadly across large areas of the U.S., and have different demographics (Douthit et al., 2015). Compared to urban areas, rural communities face higher poverty rates, lower educational attainment, lack of transportation, a higher proportion of elderly individuals, and lack of access to health services (Hunsaker & Kantayya, 2010; Ricketts, 2000). Owing to these factors, rural communities face elevated rates of morbidity and mortality and greater percentages of excess deaths from the five leading causes of death including cancer and cardiovascular disease (Garcia et al., 2019). Rural older adults have a higher prevalence of several chronic diseases compared to urban older adults, including c",

From sparsely populated farming communities to isolated mountain towns, rural areas often lack the resources to maintain specialty healthcare services. This leads to a healthcare disparity for millions of Americans living in these regions, who may find it difficult to access specialists like cardiologists, oncologists, and mental health professionals. However, telemedicine is emerging as a powerful solution to close this gap. By leveraging digital technology, telemedicine offers a way to connect rural patients with specialized care in an affordable, efficient, and convenient manner. In this blog, we\u2019ll explore how telemedicine is transforming healthcare for rural communities, the specific benefits it brings, the challenges it faces, and what the future holds for this crucial healthcare advancement. The Healthcare Challenges Facing Rural America Before diving into the role of telemedicine, it\u2019s essential to understand the unique healthcare challenges that rural areas face: 1. Limited Access to Specialists: In rural areas, primary care physicians may be available, but specialists are often located in urban centers, hours away. Patients in need of specialty care are forced to travel long distances, which is time-consuming and costly. 2. Workforce Shortages: The rural healthcare system faces an ongoing shortage of medical professionals. The rural physician-to-population ratio is about 13 physicians per 10,000 people, compared to 31 physicians per 10,000",

Before the spread of online consulting, patients and their caregivers had to travel long distances and suffered from limited resources and a shortage of medical facilities. This made simple check-ups and routine consulting challenging to obtain. Rural telemedicine removes the barriers created by distance and makes healthcare accessible for everyone. A patient can open a laptop or mobile device, schedule a meeting with the preferred doctors, and get consulting, even if they live in a remote village. Want to know more about rural telemedicine and how it will keep changing? Read our overview to discover the recent trends and high-demand niches. State of Rural Telemedicine Overview Rural telemedicine in the United States and globally considerably differs in quality and coverage compared to urban areas. As of 2022, rural regions, comprising 19.3% of the US population, struggled with fewer healthcare providers than urban areas. They have only 13.1 physicians per 10,000 people versus 31.2 in urban settings. Rural residents also report higher rates of fair or poor health. Besides, rural healthcare faces some infrastructural limitations such as inadequate broadband access. Due to poor internal connection, rural residents cannot always use online consulting effectively. Fortunately, governments and healthcare facilities make steps to expand the telemedicine infrastructure and engage rural residents to join telemedicine programs for achieving equitable access to healthcare services across rural communities. Despite these challenges, the rural population shows an increasing interest in telehealth solutions (44% of rural beneficiaries used telehealth services) driven by the need for convenient and accessible healthcare options. People who have tried remote consulting share positive reviews and are ready to use it again. ",

Other outcomes included assessing specialty availability and frequency of referrals at rural sites. Methods This mixed methods study included surveys and semi-structured interviews of rural primary care physicians (PCPs). Survey data were analyzed with summary statistics and cross-tabulations. Interview transcripts were inductively thematically analyzed. Results Of the 19 PCPs who completed the survey, 37% agreed/strongly agreed current telemedicine practices connected patients to better specialty care; 90% agreed/strongly agreed it had such potential. Interviews revealed telemedicine could improve care when local specialists were unavailable and provided the most benefit in acute care settings or specialist follow-ups. Most survey respondents reported outreach specialists were highly effective in addressing rural specialty care needs. Respondents reported cardiology, general surgery, orthopedic surgery, ENT/otolaryngology, and dermatology as the most frequently referred-to specialties. In-person neurology, gastroenterol",

This new rule outlines a sweeping set of changes aimed at creating a more equitable, accessible, and innovative healthcare system. Key modifications focus on telehealth services, expanding access for beneficiaries while adjusting certain policies established during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE). Key Telehealth Policy Updates in the 2025 PFS Rule As the COVID-19 PHE telehealth waivers are set to expire, CMS is implementing adjustments to preserve critical elements while phasing out others. Here\u2019s a detailed look at the finalized changes for Medicare telehealth services: New Services Added to the Telehealth List: For CY 2025, CMS has provisionally added caregiver training services to the Medicare Telehealth Services List, providing support for family members or others assisting with patient care. Additionally, PrEP counseling and safety planning interventions have been permanently added. This expansion broadens the range of telehealth services available to beneficiaries, reinforcing CMS\u2019s goal of a patient-centered approach. Suspension of Frequency Limits: CMS is extending the suspension of frequency limitations on telehealth for specific service types. This includes subsequent inpatient and nursing facility visits as well as critical care consultations, allowing for greater flexibility in high-need cases. Continued Audio-Only Telehealth: Starting January 1, 2025, CMS is finalizing a policy that allows Medicare telehealth services to include two-way, real-time audio-only technology if the beneficiary is either unable to use video technology or prefers not to do so. This change applies to services delivered to ",

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

In healthcare, we have seen this discussed as technology and internet access gaps between underserved populations and everyone else. But access is not the biggest gap. In 2018, 86% of the more than 70 million Americans on Medicaid owned a smartphone. During the coronavirus pandemic, young Americans of color were more likely to post on social media about their COVID-19 experiences than white Americans. Underserved communities have and use technology, but digital health solutions are not tailored to older people or those with lower digital literacy. At a time when a telemedicine visit can be as simple as a telephone call or video chat, the conversation must expand beyond access to technology and internet. When considering the digital divide in healthcare, what if we stopped talking about what communities lack and focused on innovating for the skills, cultural context, and technology they have?

Nevertheless, the digital divide has exacerbated the social and economic factors that create barriers to health and well-being. It, therefore, maybe a social determinant of health (SDOH). Such issues as decreased internet connectivity and a lack of Wi-Fi and video chat/webcam in both urban and rural areas can hinder the effectiveness of telehealth to its full capability, especially among communities of color, the poor, and medically underserved. The social aspects of the provision of health care by physicians and health care workers are utilized to combat mistrust and strengthen the physician-patient therapeutic relationship. Addressing policy changes to address the digital divide as a SDOH may strengthen existing health care and public health systems to allow for patient and community-centered approaches to expressing lived narratives, including in a digital format.

Abstract In recent years, telehealth visits have surged in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, existing structural inequities impact the access and use of information technology based on social and geographical characteristics, which is referred to as the digital divide. This has created disparities between patients with access to video visits vs. telephone visits. Previous telehealth research has focused on the completion of video visits. However, further research is needed to understand patients who decline video visits and rely on phone visits. We conducted semi-structured interviews (n\u2009=\u200913) of older patients (n\u2009=\u20099) and clinical support staff (n\u2009=\u20094) to understand the barriers in accessing virtual care. Most patients reported feeling left behind with telehealth, despite having access to a computer or smartphone. Clinical staff identified access to reliable technology and the ability for patients to navigate the technology as primary barriers to accessing virtual care. Many patients indicated an interest in video visits, but wanted low tech solutions",

Telemedicine offers the opportunity to provide clinical services at a distance, thereby bridging geographic and other barriers to medical care. With the need to socially distance during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID\u201019) pandemic, clinical practices across the United States rapidly transitioned to telemedicine, which quickly became the predominant mode of outpatient care delivery. 1 , 2 While in\u2010person clinic visits will resume post\u2010pandemic, telemedicine will remain a major component to health\u2010care delivery as it fills gaps and satisfies patient needs in ways in\u2010person clinical visits cannot. 3 Yet, if the technology is not used equitably and uniformly adopted, the move toward telemedicine will exacerbate the deep underlying health\u2010care disparities exposed by the pandemic. People with limited digital literacy or who lack access to digital devices or reliable broadband Internet, people experiencing homelessness, and people with limited English proficiency have unique challenges accessing telemedicine. 4 It is critical that we identify barriers to telemedicine use and develop solutio",

These permissions are granted for the duration of the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Abstract Purpose of Review Disparities in health outcomes are a well documented and worrisome part of our health care system. These disparities persist in spite of, and are occasionally exacerbated by, new technologies that are intended to improve health care. This results in a \u201cdigital divide\u201d in which populations that have poorer health outcomes continue to have poorer health outcomes despite technological improvements. Recent Findings In many ways, the digitical divide is already shrinking via improved access to internet and technology/process improvements. For example, people with schizophrenia, PTSD, and bipolar disorder have had their care successfully augmented by new technology. However, problems persist- being impoverished, female, and black all correlate with decreased probability of completing a telehealth visit, and millions of americans have insufficient internet access to complete telehealth visits. Summary We must continue to utilize new technology in health care to improve outcomes, but we must also be wary to ensure those outcomes are equitable across different populations.

This is an Open Access article: verbatim copying and redistribution of this article are permitted in all media for any purpose Abstract Accelerated use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled uninterrupted healthcare delivery while unmasking care disparities for several vulnerable communities. The social determinants of health (SDOH) serve as a critical model for understanding how the circumstances in which people are born, work, and live impact health outcomes. We performed semi-structured interviews to understand patients and providers\u2019 experiences with telemedicine encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a deductive approach, we applied the SDOH to determine telemedicine\u2019s role and impact within this framework. Overall, patient and provider interviews supported the use of existing SDOH domains to describe disparities in Internet access and telemedicine use, rather than reframing technology as a sixth SDOH. In order to mitigate the digital divide, we identify and propose solutions that address SDOH-related barriers that shape the use of health information technologies.

However, telemedicine may exacerbate disparities for populations with limited digital literacy or access, such as older adults, racial minorities, patients of low income, rural residences, or limited English proficiency. From March 2020 to March 2022, this retrospective cohort study analyzed the use of in-person, phone/message, and telemedical care at a single tertiary care center in an oncology department. We investigated the association between economic, racial, ethnic, socioeconomic factors and forms of care, including in-person visits, telemedicine-based visits, and telephone/messages. The study results show that telemedicine utilization is lower among patients 65 and older, female patients, American Indian or Alaska Native patients, uninsured patients, and patients who require interpreters during clinical visits. As a result, it is unlikely that telemedicine will provide equal access to clinical care for all populations. On the other hand, in-person ca",

Objective The aim of this study is to evaluate literature on current applications, therapeutic areas, and outcomes of telehealth interventions in rural communities in the United States. Methods A narrative review of studies published on PubMed from January 2017 to December 2020 was conducted. Key search terms included telehealth, telemedicine, rural, and outcomes. Results Among 15 included studies, 9 studies analyzed telehealth interventions in patients, 3 in health care professionals, and 3 in both patients and health care professionals. The included studies reported positive outcomes and experiences of telehealth use in rural populations including acceptability and increased satisfaction; they also noted that technology is convenient and efficient. Other notable benefits included decreased direct and indirect costs to the patient (travel cost and time) and health care service provider (staffing), lower onsite health care resource utilization, improved physician recruitment and retention, improved access to care, and increased education and training of patients and health care professionals. Conclusions Telehealth models were associated with positive outcomes for patients and health care professionals, suggesting these models are feasible and can be effective.

Last Updated: December 13, 2022 Individuals living in rural communities want to stay there. And why not! Ask most rural residents, and they\u2019ll have a long list of the reasons they love their rural community. And nearly 80% of rural small business owners agree the quality of life and cost of living is much better in rural areas, according to the U.S. Chamber Technology Engagement Center. All this is true despite the ways rural communities quantitatively lag behind their metropolitan counterparts \u2014 for example, access to healthcare providers like hospitals, primary doctors, and specialists. Access to healthcare is necessary for a thriving community, and residents in rural areas deserve equal access to quality healthcare. So how do rural areas overcome any gaps in healthcare access? Telehealth offers impactful methods of providing healthcare and outreach to rural communities. What Is Telehealth? The telehealth definition used in this article is the delivery of healthcare to individuals over a high-speed internet connection. In addition to having virtual meetings with healthcare providers, other types of services include: telemedicine (the provision of remote medical care via the Internet and video conferencing),\u00a0 electronic medical record keeping, and\u00a0 portal technology and videoconferencing.\u00a0 Remote health monitoring tools such as wearables and biosensors that track and report personal health information have also become commonplace for remote health care. Combined, these methods of communicating with healthcare providers help close the rural-urban healthcare access divide. Before we examine the benefits of telehealth in rural areas, let\u2019s talk about rural healthcare in general. What Does Healthcare Look Like in Rural Communities? Regardless of community s",

Telemedicine Health Disparities in the Black Community & the Hispanic Community \u00a0 Although telemedicine has emerged as a crucial tool in expanding access to healthcare concerns about disparities in telemedicine usage are becoming more well-researched, particularly among historically underserved communities. In a cross-sectional study recently reported by the JAMA Network, an author team led by Felippe O.\u00a0Marcondes examined telemedicine utilization data for Medicare beneficiaries. They focused on health disparities within the Black community and the Hispanic community. Understanding Health Disparities in the Black Community Health disparities in the Black community, as well as in the Hispanic community, encompass a complex web of socioeconomic, environmental, and systemic factors that contribute to differential access to healthcare and health outcomes. Within this framework, telemedicine has emerged as a potential avenue for bridging these disparities by overcoming barriers to traditional in-person care. Key Findings of Recent Study Their study examined a national sample of 14\u202f,305,\u202f819 Medicare beneficiaries, of which 7.4% reported being Black, 5.6% Hispanic, and 4.2% other race. Initially, Black individuals, along with Hispanic and other marginalized groups, exhibited higher rates of telemedicine visits. However, a different narrative unfolded upon closer examination and adjustment for geographic factors. Despite residing in communities with greater telemedicine availability, Black individuals and other minorities received fewer telemedicine services compared to their White counterparts. Exploring the Role of Geography Geography emerges as a critical determinant shaping disparities in telemedicine utilization. Minority communities, often concentrated in urban areas with robust telemedicine infrastructure, paradoxically experienced lower telemedicine uptake. This geographic disparity underscores the need for targeted i",

Studies have shown that Black and Hispanic/Latino individuals are more likely than White individuals to experience barriers in accessing timely medical care, citing obstacles such as long waiting times, inconvenient office hours, and lack of transportation. Telehealth helps eliminate these barriers, allowing patients from underserved communities to access care when and where it is convenient. Language barriers are another recognized source of health inequity for ethnic minority communities whose health communication needs cannot often be adequately met. Telehealth translation services can help resolve this challenge by ensuring effective communication between providers and patients. Additionally, telehealth can make patients more comfortable receiving medical care in their own home and allow for a broader scope of physicians to choose from. Minority populations, especially those with unique cultural practices and beliefs, may face discrimination, stereotyping or a lack of understanding from health care providers, resulting in inadequate care, mistrust and reluctance to seek medical help in the future. Access to more specialty care providers is also a benefit of telehealth that affects minority populations. Racial and ethnic minority groups experience higher rates of illness and death across a wide range of health conditions, including diabetes, hypertension, obesity, asthma, and heart disease, when compared to their W",

Driven by an urgent need to keep patients safe from the virus while continuing to provide care, health care organizations rapidly scaled up telemedicine services. However, while infrastructure has rapidly expanded, it is important to recognize that a \u201cdigital divide\u201d still exists in the US: Nearly one third of rural Americans lack access to high-speed broadband services, and the gap in access extends beyond rural America along economic and racial lines. The following is an excerpt from the Institute for Healthcare Improvement\u2019s Telemedicine: Ensuring Safe, Equitable, Person-Centered Virtual Care white paper that outlines recommendations for improving telemedicine access. To take advantage of what telemedicine can offer, patients need to be able to access it. The most important considerations for patient access to telemedicine services include appropriate technological infrastructure (e.g., devices, internet connectivity) and basic technology knowledge and skills (sometimes referred to as digital literacy). It is also important to respect patient preference for the type of telemedicine technology they wish to use (e.g., telephone versus video). The biggest barriers to telemedicine access involve infrastructure. About 15 percent of American households lack a smartphone and at least 10 percent lack access to the internet beyond cellular data. For video-based telemedicine visits, both the patient and provider need reliable access to the Internet or Wi-Fi signal and a device with video capabilities (e.g., laptop, smartphone, tablet). Infrastructure and technological barriers differ by race, income, and geographic location, among other factors.

Share this item with your network: By Anuja Vaidya, Senior Editor Published: 27 Jun 2024 Even as telehealth adoption and utilization soared amid the in-person care restrictions of the COVID-19 pandemic, it quickly became apparent that expanding telehealth access equitably is easier said than done. The public health emergency (PHE) threw into sharp relief the disparities in the digital healthcare arena, from income and housing insecurity to race and age-related barriers. As researchers delved into the various social determinants of health (SDOH) hurdles hindering virtual care, a particularly trenchant one emerged: lack of broadband access. Broadband, or high-speed internet, allows people to access the internet at significantly higher speeds than dial-up services, according to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The high speed is facilitated through various digital transmission technologies that move text, images, and sound as \u201cbits\u201d of data. These include digital subscriber lines (DSL), cable modems, fiber, wireless, and satellite technologies. Access to fast, reliable, and secure broadband is critical for the delivery and receipt of digital healthcare, including telehealth.

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

This is an Open Access article: verbatim copying and redistribution of this article are permitted in all media for any purpose Abstract Accelerated use of telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled uninterrupted healthcare delivery while unmasking care disparities for several vulnerable communities. The social determinants of health (SDOH) serve as a critical model for understanding how the circumstances in which people are born, work, and live impact health outcomes. We performed semi-structured interviews to understand patients and providers\u2019 experiences with telemedicine encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a deductive approach, we applied the SDOH to determine telemedicine\u2019s role and impact within this framework. Overall, patient and provider interviews supported the use of existing SDOH domains to describe disparities in Internet access and telemedicine use, rather than reframing technology as a sixth SDOH. In order to mitigate the digital divide, we identify and propose solutions that address SDOH-related barriers that shape the use of health information technologies.

Abstract A unique and sudden need for virtual medical visits created by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to an unprecedented expansion of telemedicine across nearly all medical specialties in the United States. In addition to providing essential medical services during the pandemic, telemedicine has the potential to expand health care access to underserved populations by eliminating traditional barriers to care such as transportation needs, distance from specialty providers, and approved time off from work. However, the literature regarding telehealth accessibility for low-income, non-English-speaking, and minority patients remains limited. Through a cross-sectional analysis comparing 2019 clinic visits with 2020 telehealth visits at the UMass Memorial Medical Center, we demonstrate specialty-specific changes in patient demographics, including a younger population, fewer non-English-speaking patients, and a relative preservation of minority, Medicaid, and Medicare patients among telehealth visits in com",

But its widespread acceptance was dramatically accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has given patients timely access to care without exposing them to the risk of contracting the coronavirus. However, it also poses a risk of widening inequities in health care in the United States by improving care for those who already have access while leaving behind those who are in need. As the pandemic has highlighted, the disparity is already huge: More than 31 million Americans were uninsured in 2020, limiting health care access during the worst public health crisis in decades. Therefore, it is vital that telemedicine be implemented in a way that closes, rather than increases, the gap.

By\u00a0Mallory Hackett October 05, 2020 12:13 pm Share \u00a0 Telehealth has been applauded for its ability to increase access to healthcare, especially during the pandemic, but when looking at telehealth usage for different social determinant health categories significant disparities exist, according to analysis from Kantar Health. Kantar Health\u2019s Social Determinants of Telehealth monitor combines results from its National Health and Wellness survey with claims data provided by Komodo to assess how socioeconomic factors impact telehealth usage. The data tracker illustrates usage disparities across several different demographics which indicates health outcome inequalities for some groups and advantages for others, according to Kantar Health. For example, across racial/ethnic groups, Hispanic individuals use telehealth more frequently than any other group. During the week of August 10, the most recent week on Kantar Health\u2019s tracker, 21% of adults in the Hispanic category used a telehealth service. When compared to other racial/ethnic groups during that same time, 16% of non-Hispanic Black individuals and 13% of non-Hispanic white individuals used telehealth. Because the Hispanic population has a\u00a0higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity \u2013 two conditions that require chronic care management\u00a0 \u2013 Kantar Health believes their increased use of telehealth will lead to better adherence to chronic disease medications and positive health outcomes. On the flip side are obese patients, who at the beginning of the pandemic had a peak of telehealth usage of 34% during the week of April 6. Since then, however, telehealth usage among obese individ",

Abstract Healthcare in the third millennium is largely delivered through systems involving the use of the technological devices and services, foremost among them telemedicine. For the adequate delivery of digital medicine services, however, it is necessary for users to be digitally literate, that is, able to consciously make use of technology. In order to understand how relevant digital literacy is in determining the effectiveness of e-Health services, we performed a traditional literature review on 3 major databases by combining the terms \u201cDigit",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Technology advances and research have expanded use of telehealth in health care delivery. Physical medicine and rehabilitation providers may use telehealth to deliver care to populations with neurologic and musculoskeletal conditions, commonly treated in both acute care and outpatient settings. Patients with impaired mobility and those living in locations with reduced access to care may particularly benefit. Video-teleconferencing has been shown to be effective for management of burn patients during acute rehabilitation, including reduced health care use expenses and less disruptions to care. Telehealth can facilitate developing interprofessional care plans. Patients with neurologic conditions including stroke, spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may use telehealth to monitor symptoms and response to treatment. Telehealth also may facilitate occupational and physical therapy programs as well as improve weight management and skin care in patients with chronic conditions. Other applications include imaging review in sports medicin",

Telemedicine, a subset of telehealth, is defined as the distribution of health-related information between a provider and patient via telecommunication technologies. While telehealth refers to remote nonclinical services, telemedicine refers to remote clinical services. The major goal of telemedicine is to improve a patient\u2019s clinical health status. Telemedicine requires audio and visual components and can be provided either in real time as live, two-way audiovisual interactions between patients and providers (synchronous telemedicine) or by storing and forwarding data and images for use at a different time (asynchronous telemedicine).1 Recently, telemedicine has gained popularity with patients due to ease of use, decreased cost, and decreased travel time. However, it also has several limitations, which will be discussed later.1 Before a telemedicine visit, providers should anticipate and manage patient ",

As health care changes to incorporate new technology, such as virtual health care, the components that lead to diagnosis must likewise evolve. The virtual physical exam has limitations compared with the traditional exam. Despite this limitation, every year more patients are seen virtually with high satisfaction. Data have shown that supplementary real-time patient-provider video telemedicine increases access and extends established patient-physician relationships which will likely fuel increased telemedicine adoption even further. However, to date, there are limited data regarding the validity of the virtual examination compared with the traditional physical exam.

Abstract Background The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted the decrease of in-person visits to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Telemedicine is an efficient communication tool employed between healthcare providers and patients that prevents the risk of exposure to infected persons. However, telemedicine use is not infallible; its users report",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Objective: To evaluate whether utilizing telemedicine in the first 9 months of the COVID-19 pandemic impacted performance on a diabetes quality of care measure for patients at a large academic medical center. We hypothesized care quality would reduce less among telemedicine users. Design: Quasi-experimental design using binomial logistic regression. Covariates included age, gender, race, ethnicity, type of insurance, hierarchical condition category score, primary language at the individual level, and zip code-level income. Participants: All adult patients younger than 75 years of age diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (N = 16,588) as of 3/19/2020 at a single academic health center. Interventions: Completion of one or more telemedicine encounters with an institutional primary care physician or endocrinologist between 3/19/2020 and 12/19/2020. Main measures: The components met in a five-item composite measure of diabetes quality of care, as of patients' last clinical encounter.

The choice between telehealth vs in-person care has become increasingly relevant for patients seeking medical attention. This article explores the differences, benefits, and limitations of telehealth and in-person visits, helping you make an informed decision on which option to choose for your healthcare needs. What is Telehealth and How Does It Compare to In-Person Care? Understanding Telehealth Services Telehealth refers to the delivery of healthcare services through digital communication technologies. This encompasses virtual visits, video appointments, and other remote interactions between patients and healthcare providers. Telemedicine has become a popular alternative to traditional in-person visits, especially during the pandemic when health concerns made many patients hesitant to visit medical facilities. Telehealth allows patients to consult with their physicians from the comfort of their homes, making healthcare more accessible and convenient. However, understanding the nuances of telehealth is essential to determine when it is the most appropriate option. Benefits of In-Person Care While telehealth offers several advantages, in-person care remains irreplaceable for many medical situations. One significant benefit of in-person visits is the ability for physicians to conduct thorough physical exams. Certain health conditions may require direct observation, palpation, or other hands-on assessments that cannot be replicated through a screen. Additionally, in-person appointments foster stronger doctor-patient relationships, as face-to-face interactions can lead to improved communication and trust. Patients often feel more comfortable discussing sensitive health issues in person,",

This in-depth guide looks at both choices in great detail, helping you determine which may work best for your medical requirements. Understanding the Key Differences: Telemedicine vs In-Person Visits In-person visits or Telemedicine have the same goal, but how they are carried out is very different. In-person visits involve talking to a doctor in a medical center in person. Patients go to see their doctors in person for exams and advice. Doctors can do immediate procedures, diagnostic tests, and evaluations with their bare hands. Telemedicine operates through digital platforms. Patients can talk to their doctors and nurses through video calls or texting apps. Doctors evaluate symptoms by looking at them and hearing what the patient says. They can give medical advice, write prescriptions for medicines, and order tests from afar. The virtual style lets people quickly talk from anywhere. Each of these different methods benefits different types of health problems. The patient\u2019s choice is based on their health, personal tastes, and how easy it is to get to the facility.

On Behalf of Devlin, Cittadino & Shaw, P.C. | Nov 2, 2020 | Medical Malpractice As the need for telehealth visits has risen dramatically in 2020, healthcare providers face new scrutiny as they rely on different data to make a patient diagnosis than they would for in-person doctor\u2019s visits. This potentially opens them up to malpractice suits if a patient is harmed due to a misdiagnosis, negligent omission, miscommunication or software malfunction. And from 2014 to 2018, 66% of the malpractice claims involving telemedicine were diagnosis-related. In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services has temporarily relaxed the HIPAA privacy regulations in order to allow more flexibility with doctor-patient communications through a variety of video-conferencing platforms. This means that there are potential breaches to a patient\u2019s protected health information. As a result, ransomware and phishing scams have increased by 350% since March, exposing the healthcare industry to potential cyber-liability. How does a misdiagnosis harm the patient? Healthcare providers owe a duty to their patients of a standard of care, including diagnosis, that is recognized by peer health care professionals, and they must also meet a similarly acceptable standard of medical treatment. This duty is required whether the care is given in-person or virtually. Even if there has been a miscommunication, not enough information provided by",

The physical exam and telehealth: between past and future The physical examination: a declining skill Performing the physical examination is an essential skill for\u00a0any expert diagnostician [1] and has been an integral part\u00a0of\u00a0the patient encounter for centuries. However, many studies have shown a decline in physical exam skills among physicians and trainees [2], [3], [4]. The reason for this decline is\u00a0likely multifactorial including increased reliance on technology, lack of bedside teaching [5] and the pressures of time constraints [6]. This issue is further compounded by the\u00a02023 CPT documentation guidelines for evaluation and\u00a0management (E/M Services) that no longer require documentation of a physical exam for billing. This decay has led to a series of harmful and undesired consequences including an increased risk of diagnostic errors, unnecessary investigations, and unneeded referrals, all resulting in added health care costs and difficulty in meeting patient needs, particularly in low resource settings [7], [8], [9]. On the other hand, telehealth saw massive growth during the COVID 19 pandemic. Between 2010 and 2017, the percentage of US hospitals using telehealth services rose from 35 to 76\u202f%\u00a0[10], [11], [12]. While it\u2019s unclear if telehealth has directly contributed to a further decline of physical examination skills, the shift towards telehealth has resulted in a loss of in\u00a0person physical examination in primary care [13]. The new challenges of the virtual physical exam The challenge of conducting a physical examination during a telehealth visit predates the COVID-19 outbreak. A systematic review by Lu et\u00a0al. concluded that a focused telehealth exam including neurological, HEENT, cardiopulmonary, and musculoskeletal components was equivalent to in-person physical exam [14], though acknowledging a wide range of inter-rater reliability.

Providing telehealth that meets the needs of patients in a pandemic has presented many challenges for PHC providers. The aim of this study was to describe the positive and negative implications of using telehealth in one Canadian (Quebec) and one American (Massachusetts) PHC setting during the COVID-19 pandemic as reported by physicians. Methods We conducted 42 individual semi-structured video interviews with physicians in Quebec (N = 20) and Massachusetts (N = 22) in 2020. Topics covered included their practice history, changes brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the advantages and challenges of telehealth. An inductive and deductive thematic analysis was carried out to identify implications of delivering care via telehealth. Results Four key themes were identified, each with positive and negative implications: 1) access for patients; 2) efficiency of care delivery; 3) professional impacts; and 4) relational dimensions of care. For patients\u2019 access, positive implications referred to increased availability of services; negative implications involved barriers due to difficulties with access to and use of technologies. Positive implications for efficiency were related to improved follow-up care; negative implications involved difficulties in diagnosing in the absence of direct physical examination and non-verbal cues. For professional impacts, positive implications were related to flexibility (teleworking, more availability for patients) and reimbursement, while negative implications were related to technological limitations experienced by both patients and practitioners. For relational dimensions,",

It was only until the coronavirus outbreak that telemedicine became hugely popular and widely accepted. As more people embrace telemedicine, it continues to evolve and further impact the healthcare industry. One significant impact of telemedicine is how it transforms the patient-doctor relationship in a positive manner.\u00a0 Telemedicine: A Practical Healthcare Option The Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines telemedicine as the use of telecommunications and electronic information technologies that aim to promote long-distance health care, public health administration, and patient and professional health-related education.\u00a0 The technologies include the Internet, streaming media, store-and-forward imaging, video conferencing, terrestrial and wireless communications, and mobile technology.\u00a0 Studies show telemedicine as an equally effective replacement for in-person visits in diagnosing and managing specific medical conditions, such as acute childhood illness, minor injuries, and respiratory problems, as early detection of COVID-19 infection. The pandemic has helped demonstrate how telemedicine is a practical option for on-demand healthcare and accelerated a broader reach throughout the country. Experts maintain the irreplaceable value and effectiveness of a doctor\u2019s actual touch. Telemedicine extends this touch as a practical option for patients to access and receive care. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), for example, outlines potential uses of remote access to healthcare at times when an in-person visit is not practical or feasible, such as via telemedicine: The rapid growth of people adopting telemedicine services results from advancements in technology and how health care providers (HCPs) deliver successful healthcare outcomes.

The rise of telemedicine has revolutionized the healthcare landscape, offering unprecedented access and convenience to both doctors and patients. But how does this digital transformation affect the traditional doctor-patient relationship? This comprehensive article delves into the multifaceted impacts of telemedicine, highlighting both its benefits and challenges. \u00a0 The Evolution of Telemedicine Telemedicine has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Initially, it was a tool for reaching patients in remote areas, but today, it encompasses a wide range of services including virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and mobile health apps. This evolution has been driven by advancements in technology and the increasing demand for accessible healthcare. \u00a0 Enhancing Access to Healthcare \u00a0 One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is its ability to break down geographical barriers. Patients in rural or underserved areas can now access specialists and receive high-quality care without the need to travel long distances. This not only saves time and money but also ensures that patients receive timely medical attention. \u00a0 Telemedicine offers flexible scheduling options that accommodate the busy lives of both patients and doctors. Virtual appointments can be scheduled outside of traditional office hours, making it easier for patients to seek medical advice without disrupting their daily routines. \u00a0 Improving Patient Engagement and Satisfaction \u00a0 Through telemedicine, doctors can provide more personalized care by using patient data and health records stored electronically. This allows for a more tailored approach to treatment, as doctors can easily access and review a patient\u2019s medical history during consultations. \u00a0 Patients often find virtual consultations more convenient and less intimidating than in-person visits.

Introduction A.C., a friendly Italian man, received coronary stents 8 years ago and had been feeling well until 3 months ago. He then had progressive breathing difficulty with tightness in his chest. He had loss of appetite and lost 4 kg in that period, but continued to work with good disposition. He had been to two hospital visits, in which he was informed that his lung was normal, based on X-ray. They had not reached final diagnosis, so he came to the office. His general appearance was normal; no abnormality was found on visual inspection. He had normal vital signs; no pallor to suggest anemia. The lungs, heart, abdomen and lower limbs were normal on examination, and resting ECG revealed no abnormalities either. As I palpated his neck, I noticed a mass on the left side. Subsequent examinations proved that a tumor compressed the trachea, which explained his respiratory difficulty. This is a typical example of a case in which only complete cli",

This change can impact the patient-provider relationship that often defines care, especially in primary care. Objective: This study aims to provide insight into the experiences of patients and providers with telemedicine during the pandemic, and the impact it had on their relationship. Research design: A qualitative study using thematic analysis of semistructured interviews. Subjects: Primary care providers (n=21) and adult patients (n=65) with chronic disease across primary care practices in 3 National Patient-centered Clinical Research Network sites in New York City, North Carolina, and Florida. Measures: Experiences with telemedicine during the COVID-19 pandemic in primary care. Codes related to the patient-provider relationship were analyzed for this study. Results: A recurrent theme was the challenge telemedicine posed on rapport building and alliance. Patients felt that telemedicine affected provider's attentiveness in varying ways, whereas providers appreciated that telemedicine provided unique insight ",

Telemedicine presents new challenges for diagnosis. Providers must learn how to address and overcome these risks when possible and determine when a virtual visit is not appropriate because the risk of diagnostic error is too high. Diagnostic errors are one of the most prevalent safety issues in ambulatory care and this risk can be exacerbated by a virtual visit. In one study, more than 40 percent of respondents expressed concern about their ability to get a proper treatment or diagnosis virtually. During an in-person interaction, a provider can observe a more complete presentation of the individual before them. For example, a skin rash can be viewed from more angles and the provider can touch the area of concern for a more complete assessment of the issue. Moreover, clinicians often rely on other forms of observation to fully assess a patient\u2019s condition. Observing body language, personal behaviors, and other individual characteristics can offer a more complete picture and reveal opportunities for intervention. In addition, telemedicine visits typically involve an interaction between a single provider and the patient, while office visits often involve interactions with other care professionals, including nurses, medical assistants, and technicians, all of whom can inform the final diagnosis. That said, telemedicine also has certain advantages. Video-enabled visits offer the opportunity to see the patient in context, and therefore providers may observe their living situation and how they interact within their environment. For example, the provider might ask a patient to go to the refrigerator and open a bottle or can, which enables the provider to observe the patient\u2019s mobility and dexterity as other inputs to inform diagnosis.

Abstract The telehealth revolution in response to COVID-19 has increased essential health care access during an unprecedented public health crisis. However, virtual patient care can also limit the patient-provider relationship, quality of examination, efficiency of health care delivery, and overall quality of care. As we witness the most rapidly adopted medical trend in modern history, clinicians are beginning to comprehend the many possibilities of telehealth, but its limitations also need to be understood. As outcomes are studied and federal regulations reconsidered, it is important to be precise in the virtual patient encounter approach. Herein, we offer some simple guidelines that could assist health care providers and clinic schedulers in determining the appropriateness of",

Legally, misdiagnosis can be considered a form of medical malpractice if it results from negligence or a failure to meet the standard of care. Common types of misdiagnosis include mistaking a heart attack for indigestion or diagnosing a benign tumor as malignant. The legal implications of misdiagnosis are significant because they often involve proving that the healthcare provider deviated from accepted medical practices. This can be complex, requiring expert testimony to establish what the standard of care should have been and how the provider failed to meet it. In the courtroom, misdiagnosis cases hinge on demonstrating that the incorrect diagnosis directly caused harm to the patient. This harm could manifest as unnecessary surgeries, incorrect medications, or the worsening of the actual condition due to lack of proper treatment. For instance, if a patient is misdiagnosed with a less severe condition and does not receive timely treatment for a more serious illness, the consequences can be dire. The legal process involves gathering medical records, consulting with medical experts, and often, a thorough investigation into the healthcare provider's actions and decisions. Understanding Delayed Diagnosis Delayed diagnosis, on the other hand, occurs when a correct diagnosis is not made in a timely manner, leading to a delay in appropriate treatment. This can happen for various reasons, such as a failure to order necessary tests, misinterpretation of test results, or simply not recognizing the severity of symptoms. Legally, delayed diagnosis is also a form of medical malpractice if it results from negligence. The key difference from misdiagnosis is that the correct diagnosis is eventual",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

These errors can manifest in various forms, including false positives, where a patient is incorrectly diagnosed with a condition they do not have; false negatives, where a condition is present but not identified; and delayed diagnoses, where there is a significant lag between the onset of symptoms and the correct diagnosis. Each type of diagnostic error carries its own set of risks and potential consequences for patient health, making it crucial for both healthcare providers and patients to be aware of these distinctions. The complexity of diagnostic errors is further compounded by the myriad of factors that can contribute to their occurrence. For instance, cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias or anchoring, can lead healthcare providers to overlook critical information or prematurely settle on a diagnosis. System failures, including inadequate staffing, lack of access to necessary diagnostic tools, and poor workflow management, also play a significant role. Additionally, communication breakdowns between healthcare providers, such as incomplete handovers or misinterpretations of test results, can lead to significant diagnostic errors. Understanding these different types and causes is the first step in addressing and mitigating the impact of diagnostic errors. Prevalence and Statistics Diagnostic errors are alarmingly prevalent in healthcare settings, affecting millions of patients annually. According to a study published by the National Academy of Medicine, diagnostic errors contribute to approximately 10% of patient deaths and account for 6-17% of adverse events in hospitals. These errors are particularly common in certain medical areas, such as cancer d",

Telemedicine presents new challenges for diagnosis. Providers must learn how to address and overcome these risks when possible and determine when a virtual visit is not appropriate because the risk of diagnostic error is too high. Diagnostic errors are one of the most prevalent safety issues in ambulatory care and this risk can be exacerbated by a virtual visit. In one study, more than 40 percent of respondents expressed concern about their ability to get a proper treatment or diagnosis virtually. During an in-person interaction, a provider can observe a more complete presentation of the individual before them. For example, a skin rash can be viewed from more angles and the provider can touch the area of concern for a more complete assessment of the issue. Moreover, clinicians often rely on other forms of observation to fully assess a patient\u2019s condition. Observing body language, personal behaviors, and other individual characteristics can offer a more complete picture and reveal opportunities for intervention. In addition, telemedicine visits typically involve an interaction between a single provider and the patient, while office visits often involve interactions with other care professionals, including nurses, medical assistants, and technicians, all of whom can inform the final diagnosis. That said, telemedicine also has certain advantages. Video-enabled visits offer the opportunity to see the patient in context, and therefore providers may observe their living situation and how they interact within their environment. For example, the provider might ask a patient to go to the refrigerator and open a bottle or can, which enables the provider to observe the patient\u2019s mobility and dexterity as other inputs to inform diagnosis.

Driven by technological advancements and the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine adoption soared, redefining how care is delivered. But how does telemedicine stack up against traditional in-person visits, and what does the future hold for both? The Growth of Telemedicine Telemedicine involves the remote delivery of healthcare services through technology such as video calls, phone consultations, or mobile apps.\r According to a study by McKinsey & Company, telehealth utilization increased 38-fold from pre-pandemic levels in 2020, with 17% of outpatient and office visits conducted virtually. This trend has continued, albeit at a moderated pace, highlighting its growing acceptance among patients and providers. The Pros of Telemedicine One of the most significant advantages of telemedicine is its ability to overcome geographic and logistical barriers. Patients in remote or underserved areas can access specialists without traveling long distances, enhancing healthcare equity. A 2023 report by the American Medical Association underscored telehealth\u2019s role in closing healthcare gaps, particularly for rural populations.\r Additionally, telemedicine saves time and costs for both patients and healthcare systems. The Journal of Medical Internet Research noted that telehealth could save patients up to $50 per visit while significantly reducing no-show rates. Telemedicine also fosters continuity of care, especially for chronic disease management and mental health services. By enabling regular follow-ups and real-time monitoring through wearable devices or apps, it enhances patient adherence to treatment regimens. Research published in Nature Digital Medicine has shown that digital engagement via telehealth platforms can lead to better health outcomes.\r Furthermore,",

During the early months of the pandemic, telehealth visits for care exploded. \"It was a dramatic shift in one or two weeks that we would expect to happen in a decade,\" said Dr. Ateev Mehrotra, a professor at Harvard Medical School whose research focuses on telemedicine and other health care delivery innovations. \"It's great that we served patients, but we did not accumulate the norms and [research] papers that we would normally accumulate so that we can know what works and what doesn't work.\" Now, three years after the start of the pandemic, we're still figuring that out. Although telehealth use has moderated, it has found a role in many physician practices, and it is popular with patients. More than any other field, behavioral health has embraced telehealth. Mental health conditions accounted for just under two-thirds of telehealth claims in November 2022, according to FairHealth, a nonprofit that manages a large database of private and Medicare insurance claims. Telehealth appeals to a variety of patients because it allows them to simply log on to their computer and avoid the time and expense of driving, parking, and arranging child care that an in-person visit often requires. But how do you gauge when to opt for a telehealth visit versus seeing your doctor in person? There are no hard-and-fast rules, but here's some guidance about when it may make more sense to choose one or the other. If it's your first visit \"As a patient, you're trying to evaluate the physician, to see if you can talk to them and trust them,\" said Dr. Russell Kohl, a family physician and board member of the American A",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Here is a review of the issues at hand.\u00a0\u00a0 Telemedicine in Healthcare Telemedicine or telehealth allows healthcare providers to offer\u00a0patients diagnosis and treatment remotely. Throughout the coronavirus pandemic, it has been crucial in allowing patients and doctors to interact whilst avoiding personal contact.\u00a0\u00a0 According to McKinsey, telehealth claims increased 78 times between February and April 2020.\u00a0Nearly one in three consultations took place via Telehealth\u00a0platforms\u00a0during that month.\u00a0Following this spike,\u00a0usage settled somewhat over the following months. However, even after more than six months of stabilization, the number remains 38% higher than before the pandemic.\u00a0\u00a0 Experts\u00a0believe that improving consumer and provider attitudes, regulatory changes, and investment\u00a0is\u00a0contributing to\u00a0the\u00a0sustained growth of the sector.\u00a0\u00a0 Despite its growing popularity, telemedicine is\u00a0facing\u00a0several\u00a0challenges.

The impact of different types of eHealth on relationships and trust and the factors influencing the impact were thematically analyzed. Results A total of 79 reviews were included. Patient-provider relationships were discussed more frequently as compared to provider-provider relationships. Communication systems like telemedicine were the most discussed type of technology. eHealth was found to have both positive and negative impacts on relationships and/or trust. This impact was influenced by a range of patient-related, provider-related, technology-related, and organizational factors, such as patient sociodemographics, provider communication skills, technology design, and organizational technology implementation, respectively. Conclusions Recommendations are provided for effective and equitable technology selection, application, and training to optimize the impact of eHealth on relationships and trust. The review findings can inform providers\u2019 and policymakers\u2019 decision-making around the use of eHealth in primary care delivery to facilitate relationship-building.

It involves a systematic evaluation of the body\u2019s systems. It is often the first step in diagnosing illnesses, formulating treatment plans, and monitoring patient progress. This article will explore the purpose of physical examination, its importance, components, techniques, preparation, benefits, limitations, frequency, and the role of technology and healthcare providers in conducting thorough examinations. Table of Contents Definition of physical examination A physical examination, also known as a medical or clinical examination, refers to assessing a patient\u2019s physical condition through observation, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. It involves gathering information about the patient\u2019s medical history, conducting a visual inspection, feeling for abnormalities, tapping the body to assess underlying structures, and listening to sounds produced by the body. Importance And Purpose of physical examination A physical examination gathers comprehensive information about a patient\u2019s health status, which helps healthcare providers make informed decisions regarding diagnosis, treatment, and preventive measures. It allows for the early detection of potential health issues, providing an opportunity for prompt intervention and improved patient outcomes. Regular physical examinations are particularly crucial for individuals with chronic conditions, as they aid in monitoring and managing their health. Process Physical examinations typically follow a standardized process to ensure thoroughness and consistency. The healthcare provider begins by reviewing the patient\u2019s medical history and discussing current symptoms or concerns. They then examine various body systems, such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, musculoskeletal, gastrointestinal, and neurological systems. This proces",

Due to prescriptions for social distancing in preventing COVID19, physical examination is being performed lesser than before. This poses a serious threat to the abilities of NPHW as well as to their relationship with the community.

Physical Examination or Clinical Examination: importance and objectives. Updated:July 4, 2024 The use of physical examination to determine the health of people is not new. Medical literature reveals that periodic health examinations were required of the Spartans of an ancient Greece. American doctors have encouraged periodic health examination of children and adults as a preventive health measure since so many years ago. But only in the last few decades has the general public accepted the idea that much physical disorder can be detected in the earliest stages by an examining physician and corrective measures prescribed to ensure the maximum number of productive years for the patient. Heart disease, \u00a0Cancer, \u00a0diabetes, \u00a0hypertension, and glaucoma are just a few examples of diseases that a doctor can detect during a routine physical examination long before disabling symptoms begin to be noticeable to the patient. The Pap Smear test for a woman is a specific example of an examination technique that can predict the development of cervical cancer several years before the woman might notice signs and symptoms of the insidious disease.

By\u00a0Emily Olsen December 02, 2021 11:54 am Share \u00a0 Photo: Geber86/Getty Images Respondents to a survey published in JAMA Network Open were interested in using video telehealth visits in the future, but most preferred to access healthcare in person. \u201cThis survey study found that participants were generally willing to use video visits but preferred in-person care, and those who preferred video visits were more sensitive to paying out-of-pocket cost,\u201d researchers wrote. TOP-LINE DATA The survey found 66.5% of participants wanted at least some video visits in the future, but when they had a choice between an in-person and\u00a0a video visit when out-of-pocket costs weren\u2019t a factor, 53% preferred an in-person visit. Meanwhile, 20.9% of respondents preferred a video visit, and 26.2% didn\u2019t have a preference or didn\u2019t know. Exposure to video telehealth video visits affected participants\u2019 views. The survey found 45% of participants reported having at least one video visit with providers since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. Among that group, 44.2% preferred in-person, and 31.4% would rather use video. But for those who didn\u2019t have experience with video visits, 60.2% preferred an in-person visit, and only 12.2% preferred video. The survey also aimed to gauge participants\u2019 interest when costs varied between the two modalities. When participants who preferred video visits were asked about a $30 video visit compared with a $10 in-person visit, 18.9% still would rather use video, 61.7% switched to in-person visit, and 19.1% didn\u2019t have a preference or didn\u2019t know.

Objectives: This study aimed to determine the prevalence of MS misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis, time delay in reaching a correct diagnosis and potential impact of sex. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis on MS diagnostic errors. Results: Out of 3910 studies, we included 62 for a qualitative synthesis and 24 for meta-analyses. Frequency of misdiagnosis (incorrect assignment of an MS diagnosis) ranged from 5% to 41%, with a pooled proportion based on six studies of 15% (95% CI: 9%-26%, n = 1621). The delay to rectify a misdiagnosis ranged from 0.3 to 15.9 years. Conversely, underdiagnosis (unrecognized diagnosis of MS) ranged from 3% to 58%, with a pooled proportion in four studies of 36% (95% CI: 20%-55%, n = 728). Pooling seven studies comprising 2851 individuals suggested a diagnostic delay to establish a correct MS diagnosis of 17.3 months (95% CI: 11.9-22.7) in patients underdiagnosed.

Legally, misdiagnosis can be considered a form of medical malpractice if it results from negligence or a failure to meet the standard of care. Common types of misdiagnosis include mistaking a heart attack for indigestion or diagnosing a benign tumor as malignant. The legal implications of misdiagnosis are significant because they often involve proving that the healthcare provider deviated from accepted medical practices. This can be complex, requiring expert testimony to establish what the standard of care should have been and how the provider failed to meet it. In the courtroom, misdiagnosis cases hinge on demonstrating that the incorrect diagnosis directly caused harm to the patient. This harm could manifest as unnecessary surgeries, incorrect medications, or the worsening of the actual condition due to lack of proper treatment. For instance, if a patient is misdiagnosed with a less severe condition and does not receive timely treatment for a more serious illness, the consequences can be dire. The legal process involves gathering medical records, consulting with medical experts, and often, a thorough investigation into the healthcare provider's actions and decisions. Understanding Delayed Diagnosis Delayed diagnosis, on the other hand, occurs when a correct diagnosis is not made in a timely manner, leading to a delay in appropriate treatment. This can happen for various reasons, such as a failure to order necessary tests, misinterpretation of test results, or simply not recognizing the severity of symptoms. Legally, delayed diagnosis is also a form of medical malpractice if it results from negligence. The key difference from misdiagnosis is that the correct diagnosis is eventual",

Notably, nonverbal communication comprising of aspects such as body language, facial expressions, eye contact, tone of voice, and posture is of paramount significance. The importance of body language in healthcare, for instance, cannot be overstated as it serves as a reflection of both healthcare professionalism and empathetic patient engagement. A considerable portion of our daily interactions hinge on nonverbal cues. Thereby, adopting specific nonverbal communication techniques for healthcare professionals can greatly affect the quality of care provided and the depth of relations established with patients. Particularly in stressful situations, healthcare providers must delicately maintain an open, non-judgmental posture, make consistent eye contact and convey genuine concern to create a comforting environment for the patient. The usage of technology in healthcare such as electronic health records (EHRs) should be integrated in a manner that does not impede nonverbal communication practices. A balanced approach to technological incorporation can yield extensive nonverbal communication benefits in healthcare settings, ultimately enhancing patient care through nonverbal communication. The Pivotal Role of Nonverbal Communication in Patient-Centered Care The art of effective communication in healthcare extends beyond verbal exchanges. The nonverbal aspects often play an even more crucial role in conveying empathy, fostering mutual understanding, and building trust. Understanding Beyond Words: The Prevalence of Nonverbal Cues Noted research indicates that majority of our communication relies on nonverbal cues. Pioneering studies by Charles Darwin and Dr. Albert Mehrabian echo this sentiment by revealing how facial expressions, gestures, postures, and other nonverbal signals frequently override the impact of spoken words.

Physician negativity was not related to patient satisfaction (p\u00a0\\=\u00a00.505), but greater nurse negativity was associated with less patient satisfaction (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). Substantial differences in study design and nonverbal measures existed across studies.

Abstract Recent empirical findings document the role of nonverbal communication in cross-cultural interactions. As ethnic minority health disparities in the United States continue to persist, physician competence in this area is important. We examine physicians' abilities to decode nonverbal emotions across cultures, our hypothesis being that there is a relationship between physicians' skill in this area and their patients' satisfaction and outcomes. First part tested Caucasian and South Asian physicians' cross-cultural emotional recognition ability. Physicians completed a fully balanced forced multiple-choice test of decoding accuracy judging emotions based on facial expressions and vocal tones. In the second part, patients reported on satisfaction and health outcomes with their physicians using a survey. Scores from the patient survey were correlated with scores from the physician decoding accuracy test. Physicians, regardless of their ethnicity, were more accurate at rating Caucasian faces and vocal tones. South Asian physicians were no better at decoding the facial expressions or v",

Telehealth will continue to play a role in the nation\u2019s healthcare landscape as consumers increasingly value convenience of time, location, and the need to meet virtually in the context of a global COVID-19 pandemic. Purpose: This review highlights the effects of telehealth on patient satisfaction and healthcare quality while considering the implications on longitudinal, informational, and interpersonal continuities of care. Methods: A review was conducted utilizing peer-reviewed journal articles from databases such as PubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science. Both quantitative and qualitative studies were included in analysis. Results: Telehealth increased continuity when administered by in-network providers who have a relationship with the patient. While medical guideline adherence and prescribing behaviors varied amongst physicians who used telehealth applications, patient satisfaction remained high if telehealth was administered through their healthcare home. Conclusion: Telehealth can serve populations experiencing barriers to medical care, particularly for regions with physician shortages and in populations with limited access to in-person visits. In order to best serve patients, telehealth must meet criteria for safety, effectiveness, patient-centeredness, timeliness, efficiency, and equity. Introduction Telehealth refers to a variety of technologies and methods of delivering health care and education via a virtual interface, including but not limited to video calls, mobile health, remote patient monitoring, etc. Telehealth can be asynchronous (no face-to-face interaction) or synchronous (virtual/remote face-to-face interaction).

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

While telemedicine has historically been focused on rural and remote areas, the COVID-19 pandemic has redefined the reach of remote health care, and regulators and enforcement authorities have followed suit. For example, in March 2020, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that it would temporarily allow all Medicare beneficiaries to receive telehealth services from any location, including their homes.1 CMS also temporarily expanded the types of health care providers that can offer telemedicine services, and allowed providers to bill for telemedicine services at the same rate as in-person services. The HHS Office for Civil Rights announced that it would exercise enforcement discretion and waive potential penalties for HIPAA violations against providers who use widely available communications technologies (e.g., Skype) in good faith for telehealth treatment or diagnostic purposes.2 These regulatory flexibilities were followed by a rise in telemedicine use. According to a HHS report published on July 28, 2020,3 in February 2020\u2014the month before President Trump declared the pandemic a national emergency\u2014less than one percent (0.1%) of Medicare primary care visits were provided through telehealth. In April 2020, nearly half (43.5%) of these visits were provided through telehealth. Further, only 14,000 CMS beneficiaries received a telehealth service each week in the pre-pandemic world. A combined 10.1 million beneficiaries received a telehealth service in the period from mid-March through early-July. These regulatory flexibilities, however, have created opportunities for fraud and abuse, and thus prompted a new priority area for enforcement and compliance. Recent enforcement efforts led by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) allege that telemedicine has facilitated billions in false and fraudulent claims to health ca",

We communicate with each other using mobile and electronic modalities and are increasingly comfortable using them to receive and share information about our personal and professional lives. Recent data show that Internet use is growing among all age groups: 87 percent of adults use the Internet, and 58 percent own a smartphone [1]. Moreover, 72 percent of Internet users seek information about health online [1]. Coinciding with the evolution of electronic communication are systemic changes in health care delivery. An increasing amount of medical knowledge is required to deliver even the most basic care for a population that is living longer with chronic diseases that require close management and coordination [2]. For many primary care doctors, there are not enough hours in the day to take care of a large group of patients [3]. Given these capacity constraints, the need to find more efficient strategies for providing medical care is an urgent one. Additionally, there has been a shift from reimbursement for service to a payment model that focuses on efficiency of care and outcomes, a change that may facilitate a more rapid adoption of new care delivery models. Our health care system and society are poised, then, to take advantage of new communication technology through telemedicine. Telemedicine\u2014the use of medical information and technology to advance clinical care at a distance [4]\u2014has the potential to transform patient-centered care.

Abstract This article summarizes the report of the American Medical Association\u2019s (AMA) Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs (CEJA) on ethical practice in telehealth and telemedicine. Through its reports and recommendations, CEJA is responsible for maintaining and updating the AMA Code of Medical Ethics\u00a0(Code). CEJA reports are developed through an iterative process of deliberation with input from multiple stakeholders; report recommendations, once adopted by the AMA House of Delegates, become ethics policy of the AMA and are issued as Opinions in the Code. To provide enduring guidance for the medical profession as a whole, CEJA strives to articulate expectations for conduct that are as independent of specific technologies or models of practice as possible. The present report, developed at the request of the House of Delegates, provides broad guidance for ethical conduct relating to key issues in telehealth/telemedicine. The report and recommendations were debated at meetings of the House in June and November 2015; recommendations were adopted in June 2016 and published as Opinion E-1.2.12, Ethical Practice in Telemedicine, in November 2016. A summary of the key points of the recommendations can be found in Appendix A (online), and the full text of the opinion can be found in Appendix B (online).

Patients can receive a wide range of telehealth services, including check-ins with their primary care providers, mental health care, and specialty services. Similarly, telehealth can be provided through a wide range of technologies, including video chats, remote patient monitoring devices, and phone calls. Read\u00a0more about the types of telehealth. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has significant influence on how telehealth services are delivered and paid. For example, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) establishes payment and coverage requirements for telehealth services in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and the Office for Civil Rights establishes privacy and security requirements that affect how telehealth services can be delivered. More information on Medicare coverage for telehealth services More information on Medicaid coverage for telehealth services The COVID-19 pandemic created unprecedented challenges for how patients accessed health care. In response, Congress, HHS, and CMS implemented several flexibilities to expand access to a wide range of services that could be delivered via telehealth. This expansion increased options for health care providers to offer care to beneficiaries enrolled in Federal health care programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The Alert marks a further escalation of a multi-year effort by the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the HHS-OIG to crack down on multi-billion dollar fraud cases involving telehealth companies. It is the objective of this Commentary to place the HHS-OIG Special Fraud Alert in the context of enforcement efforts by the DOJ and HHS to stem the recent growth in telehealth fraud resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Taken together, it is apparent this is a critical moment in the evolution of telehealth and it is crucial to strike a proper balance between effective regulation and enforcement on the one hand, and access to care on the other. The HHS-OIG Alert is the first to be focused specifically on educating health care providers on the possibility that they may be recruited, perhaps unknowingly, to engage in unlawful arrangements. Though acknowledging that schemes have taken a variety of forms and involved a wide range of fraudulent billing, including for unnecessary medications, durable medical equipment, and genetic testing, the HHS-OIG warns that Telemedicine Companies have been enlisting health care providers to prescribe items and services that are medically unnecessary, potentially violating the Anti-Kickback Statute in addition to other statutes. As such, these relationships expose health care providers to potential criminal, civil, or administrative liability, including OIG exclusion. The Alert seeks to educate health care providers regarding \u201csuspect characteristics\u201d and urges them to \u201cexercise caution and use heightened scrutiny when entering into arrangements with Telemedicine Companies that have 1 or more of the suspect characteristics.\u201d These charact",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions.

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Abstract Telehealth includes health care services provided using audio and video technology. Telehealth was originally developed to provide basic care to rural and underserved patients. Higher rates of use of telehealth are now standard in many practices since the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Increasing emphases on patient satisfaction, providing efficient and quality care, and minimizing costs have also led to higher telehealth implementation. Patients and providers have enjoyed the benefits of telehealth, but widespread adoption has been hindered by regulatory, legal, and reimbursement barriers.

Abstract Telehealth includes health care services provided using audio and video technology. Telehealth was originally developed to provide basic care to rural and underserved patients. Higher rates of use of telehealth are now standard in many practices since the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. Increasing emphases on patient satisfaction, providing efficient and quality care, and minimizing costs have also led to higher telehealth implementation. Patients and providers have enjoyed the benefits of telehealth, but widespread adoption has been hindered by regulatory, legal, and reimbursement barriers. Recent legislative initiatives have advocated for further telehealth advancements, especially with the rapid implementation of telehealth in the times of coronaviru",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Abstract Regular hospital visits can be expensive, particularly in rural areas, due to travel costs. In the era of the Covid-19 Pandemic, where physical interaction becomes risky, people prefer telemedicine. Fortunately, medical visits can be reduced when telemedicine services are used through video conferencing or other virtual technologies. Thus, telemedicine saves both the patient's and the health care provider time and the cost of the treatment. Furthermore, due to its fast and advantageous characteristics, it can streamline the workflow of hospitals and clinics. This disruptive technology would make it easier to monito",

Although the expansion of telehealth services was successful in continuing to provide patients with care while preventing the spread of disease, it is less clear how patient sociodemographic characteristics influenced telehealth use during this time. This study aims to systematically review the published literature on demographic differences in telehealth access, utilization, and health outcomes among a variety of adult patient types in the United States. Methods: Litcovid, PubMed, Web of Science, and MEDLINE databases were searched, resulting in a final sample of n = 32 studies. Results: Results found that studies could be categorized as addressing at least one of eight different areas of inquiry: sociodemographic differences in telehealth use (1) during and (2) before the pandemic, telehealth use versus nonuse (3) during and (4) before the pandemic, (5) telehealth modality, (6) satisfaction with telehealth, (7) outcomes associated with telehealth use, and (8) per",

Though acknowledging that schemes have taken a variety of forms and involved a wide range of fraudulent billing, including for unnecessary medications, durable medical equipment, and genetic testing, the HHS-OIG warns that Telemedicine Companies have been enlisting health care providers to prescribe items and services that are medically unnecessary, potentially violating the Anti-Kickback Statute in addition to other statutes. As such, these relationships expose health care providers to potential criminal, civil, or administrative liability, including OIG exclusion.

But there has been less focus on ensuring that telemedicine can meet the same goals for quality as in-person care. What might be the distinctive safety concerns and unintended consequences of telemedicine? For example, while virtually meeting with a patient in their own home may offer convenience and provide valuable clinical context, it may also undermine privacy. The following adapted excerpt from the IHI Telemedicine: Ensuring Safe, Equitable, Person-Centered Virtual Care white paper explores the issue of privacy and offers recommendations to help ensure it. Privacy is paramount in any health care interaction and telemedicine is no exception. There are several aspects of privacy that are unique to telemedicine that present both challenges and potential advantages. Cybersecurity risk is one challenge that applies to telehealth more broadly. Data security and privacy breaches are a very real risk with telemedicine services, so it is essential to establish safeguards at the system level to minimize telemedicine cybersecurity risks. While some risks can be addressed by updating privacy policies, the exchange and safe storage of patient health information is critical to maintaining patient privacy and trust in telemedicine services. The American Medical Association created a useful overview on the importance of cybersecurity. In video-enabled visits, the patient\u2019s home environment may be visible to the provider. Although this can also have clinical benefits, some patients may feel that their private space is being invaded. Some patients may have difficulty finding a private space for the virtual visit, which could compromise their privacy in a different way, as others in their household may be privy to ",

For telehealth to succeed, privacy and security risks must be identified and addressed.\u00a0Health Aff (Millwood). 2014;33(2):216-221. Innovative connected health technologies offer a promising solution to many of the challenges facing health care delivery in the United States. Connected health refers to a wide range of care delivery models that utilize communications technologies (sometimes referred to as telehealth and telemedicine) to help patients manage their conditions through improved self-care and to extend clinical care outside of traditional settings [1]. Health care systems that combine patient-reported information and objective data from telehealth devices and sensors can be used to create patient-centered, personalized health interventions. Although these new technologies promise to improve the quality of care, reduce costs, and increase patient satisfaction, they raise a number of ethical issues. Hall and McGraw argue that there are significant privacy and security risks in telehealth systems that can adversely affect patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 level of trust and willingness to adopt and use the system [2]. Noting that current regulations do not provide sufficient guidance for developers or protection for users, the authors recommend that a single federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), coordinate the creation and enforcement of comprehensive privacy and security standards. In what follows, we summarize Hall and McGraw\u2019s key points and then discuss their implications based on our experience in creating, evaluating, and implementing telehealth systems. Hall and McGraw begin by describing the risks that telehealth systems pose to the privacy and security of patients\u2019 health information.

According to CMS Reports in 2021, 68 million telehealth services were delivered from March to October 2020. This was a 2,700 percent increase compared to the same period in 2019.1 However, privacy and security in telehealth practices have been identified as major concerns and challenges for the development of successful telehealth services. Millwood stated that \u201cFor telehealth to succeed, privacy and security risks must be identified and addressed.\u201d2 Protecting patient privacy and security is necessary and should be a top priority in the telehealth environment. There is more to it than being HIPAA compliant. Ensuring privacy and security builds trust between providers and patients, which opens the door for patients to make the decision to share personal and health information without concerns. Patients\u2019 information, both clinical and administrative, should be protected from breaches and cyberattacks. Ultimately, patients should have the ability to control, access, and manage their personal and health information.

It is important to understand the growing risks that certain technological changes pose. According to one analysis, data breaches cost the healthcare sector $4 billion a year. One of the biggest threats to healthcare security is telehealth. Hospital administrators and other healthcare professionals need to understand the security risks associated with telehealth services. This is essential to protect patient data and avoid HIPAA violations. The Evolution of Telehealth Creates New Cybersecurity Risks Telemedicine is the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of patients at a distance accomplished through telecommunications technology. During the COVID-19 health crisis, there was a dramatic increase in the use of telemedicine. The government added 135 services to the Medicare telehealth services list that could use telemedicine during the pandemic and promised not to pursue HIPPA violations in connection with the good faith delivery of telehealth services. The Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation reported that telehealth adoption increased by nearly 50% in primary care during the peak of the pandemic. Additionally, nearly half of Medicare primary visits in April 2020 occurred through telehealth, as compared to only 0.1% in February. How telemedicine looks and works has also changed dramatically over time. In the early days of telehealth, bulky medical equipment was used to monitor patients in primarily rural environments. Today, telehealth can be delivered through the use of much smaller and more accessible technology. However, this ease of delivery also makes telehealth systems potentially susceptible to hacking. Read on to learn about possible security risks of telemedicine and how you can protect yourself.

Statistics\u202fhave shown that from 2014 to 2022, 14,655 data breaches were reported in the United States, out of which the healthcare industry faced 4,959 breaches, the most by any industry. According to the\u202f2019 Healthcare Data Breach Report, the total number of healthcare records that were exposed, stolen, or illegally disclosed in 2019 was 41.2 million in 505 healthcare data breaches. The expanding use of remote technology in healthcare, including telehealth and telemedicine, has been accompanied by a substantial increase in cybersecurity risks.\u00a0 Cyber breaches increase the financial burden for the healthcare industry, which already encounters high expenditures and low profit margins compared to many other sectors. A\u202fsurvey\u202fconducted by the Ponemon Institute in 2022 found that 89% of the surveyed healthcare organizations experienced an average of 43 cyberattacks in the past year, and at least 20% of organizations reported that these attacks increased patient mortality rates. For 11 consecutive years, healthcare data breaches cost the highest among all industries, with an average increase of total cost from $7.13 million in 2020 to $9.23 million in 2021.\u00a0 Cybersecurity threats often stem from system vulnerabilities such as insufficient security protocols, outdated software, and a lack of regular assessments. Such increasing threats in healthcare are a significant concern for providers, policymakers, and patients. Among the various cyberattacks, denial of service (DoS), privilege escalation attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) and man-in-the-browser attacks (MITB), cryptographic attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, malware, spyware, and phishing are the most prominent ones.\u00a0 Ransomware and phishing attacks are common cyberattacks faced by healthcare organizatio",

Telemedicine describes the vast range of applications and technologies used to provide and manage healthcare remotely. Telemedicine as its most basic refers to the transmission of data from a patient to a healthcare professional through a range of electronic platforms (devices, apps, etc.). This means that the electronic platforms themselves have the ability to access the patient data. However, telemedicine can be more than a communication tool. It can be combined with sophisticated technology in services ranging from remote monitoring systems to virtual assistants to support care. The first appearance of telemedicine can be traced back to the 19th century. Since then, the use of telemedicine has been driven by the increasing availability and use of internet and communications technologies across the health sector, including for reproductive and maternal care.

For telehealth to succeed, privacy and security risks must be identified and addressed.\u00a0Health Aff (Millwood). 2014;33(2):216-221. Innovative connected health technologies offer a promising solution to many of the challenges facing health care delivery in the United States. Connected health refers to a wide range of care delivery models that utilize communications technologies (sometimes referred to as telehealth and telemedicine) to help patients manage their conditions through improved self-care and to extend clinical care outside of traditional settings [1]. Health care systems that combine patient-reported information and objective data from telehealth devices and sensors can be used to create patient-centered, personalized health interventions. Although these new technologies promise to improve the quality of care, reduce costs, and increase patient satisfaction, they raise a number of ethical issues. Hall and McGraw argue that there are significant privacy and security risks in telehealth systems that can adversely affect patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 level of trust and willingness to adopt and use the system [2]. Noting that current regulations do not provide sufficient guidance for developers or protection for users, the authors recommend that a single federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), coordinate the creation and enforcement of comprehensive privacy and security standards. In what follows, we summarize Hall and McGraw\u2019s key points and then discuss their implications based on our experience in creating, evaluating, and implementing telehealth systems. Hall and McGraw begin by describing the risks that telehealth systems pose to the privacy and security of patients\u2019 health information.

HIPAA and Telemedicine HIPAA, or the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, is federal law that sets national standards for protecting personal health information (PHI) from being shared or disclosed without consent. HIPAA covers healthcare providers, patients, health plans, and health-related business organizations. Telemedicine is a blend of healthcare and technologies. It\u2019s conducted through a phone or computer to make health information and services more accessible, especially to those who are unable to visit doctors in person for various reasons. At the moment, telemedicine involves virtual appointments, online access to treatment plans and patient information, remote communication between doctors, and more.

Many health care organizations turned to telemedicine, telecare, telehealth, and other video-teleconferencing (VTC) platforms to serve their patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. These platforms provided remote services while protecting patients and health care workers and ensuring social distancing. Since then, these telemedicine services have become more reliable and popular due to the advances in information and broadband technologies, allowing medical and other health and care professionals to offer remote, interactive services to consumers, patients, and caregivers. However, it also opened a door to many new cybersecurity threats. Telehealth options may have changed how health care providers can offer care, but remaining privy to cybersecurity threats in a landscape that continues to change is crucial. Below is an overview of cybersecurity threats associated with telehealth and how to manage them. Background on Rising Cybersecurity Threats Due to the increased use of VTC platforms that began during the pandemic, cybercriminals have shifted to innovative attack methods that focus on VTC and telemedicine platforms. Cybercriminals are attracted to new technologies as vendors sometimes don\u2019t properly patch or secure the systems to get them to market, making for easier targets. Telehealth systems use internet connections to host meetings and send sensitive information, such as personally identifiable patient information, protected health information, and payment information, all of which make them prime targets for attackers who can sell this information or use it for identity theft.\u00a0 The use of these tools also increases the attack surface of the health care provider to the following: There are a number of risks with using and relying on the platforms, such ",

By Kat Jercich September 10, 2020 11:09 AM Although a new report suggests that the healthcare industry slightly improved its security posture this year compared to last, it warns that increased provider reliance on telehealth since the COVID-19 pandemic now presents a new slate of risks to patient data. The report, released Thursday from SecurityScorecard and DarkOwl, found that telehealth systems have experienced an enormous increase in targeted attacks. \"The rapid pace at which telehealth applications were rolled out during the pandemic made them attractive targets for cybercriminals,\" said Sam Kassoumeh, COO and cofounder of SecurityScorecard\u00a0in a statement provided to Healthcare IT News. \"Our report findings illustrate that in order for the healthcare industry to protect patient and provider data, vetting and enforcing security protocols around new technology providers remains paramount,\" he added. WHY IT MATTERS The COVID-19 pandemic presented a multitude of juicy opportunities for bad actors, ranging from phishing attempts fueled by fear of the crisis to patchy work-from-home security practices. The SecurityScorecard/DarkOwl report, which examined more than 30,000 healthcare organizations from September 2019 to April 2020, notes that the reliance on telehealth amplifies risk as well.

Telemedicine describes the vast range of applications and technologies used to provide and manage healthcare remotely. Telemedicine as its most basic refers to the transmission of data from a patient to a healthcare professional through a range of electronic platforms (devices, apps, etc.). This means that the electronic platforms themselves have the ability to access the patient data. However, telemedicine can be more than a communication tool. It can be combined with sophisticated technology in services ranging from remote monitoring systems to virtual assistants to support care. The first appearance of telemedicine can be traced back to the 19th century. Since then, the use of telemedicine has been driven by the increasing availability and use of internet and communications technologies across the health sector, including for reproductive and maternal care.

Statistics\u202fhave shown that from 2014 to 2022, 14,655 data breaches were reported in the United States, out of which the healthcare industry faced 4,959 breaches, the most by any industry. According to the\u202f2019 Healthcare Data Breach Report, the total number of healthcare records that were exposed, stolen, or illegally disclosed in 2019 was 41.2 million in 505 healthcare data breaches. The expanding use of remote technology in healthcare, including telehealth and telemedicine, has been accompanied by a substantial increase in cybersecurity risks.\u00a0 Cyber breaches increase the financial burden for the healthcare industry, which already encounters high expenditures and low profit margins compared to many other sectors. A\u202fsurvey\u202fconducted by the Ponemon Institute in 2022 found that 89% of the surveyed healthcare organizations experienced an average of 43 cyberattacks in the past year, and at least 20% of organizations reported that these attacks increased patient mortality rates. For 11 consecutive years, healthcare data breaches cost the highest among all industries, with an average increase of total cost from $7.13 million in 2020 to $9.23 million in 2021.\u00a0 Cybersecurity threats often stem from system vulnerabilities such as insufficient security protocols, outdated software, and a lack of regular assessments. Such increasing threats in healthcare are a significant concern for providers, policymakers, and patients. Among the various cyberattacks, denial of service (DoS), privilege escalation attacks, man-in-the-middle (MITM) and man-in-the-browser attacks (MITB), cryptographic attacks, structured query language (SQL) injections, malware, spyware, and phishing are the most prominent ones.\u00a0 Ransomware and phishing attacks are common cyberattacks faced by healthcare organizatio",

For telehealth to succeed, privacy and security risks must be identified and addressed.\u00a0Health Aff (Millwood). 2014;33(2):216-221. Innovative connected health technologies offer a promising solution to many of the challenges facing health care delivery in the United States. Connected health refers to a wide range of care delivery models that utilize communications technologies (sometimes referred to as telehealth and telemedicine) to help patients manage their conditions through improved self-care and to extend clinical care outside of traditional settings [1]. Health care systems that combine patient-reported information and objective data from telehealth devices and sensors can be used to create patient-centered, personalized health interventions. Although these new technologies promise to improve the quality of care, reduce costs, and increase patient satisfaction, they raise a number of ethical issues. Hall and McGraw argue that there are significant privacy and security risks in telehealth systems that can adversely affect patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 level of trust and willingness to adopt and use the system [2]. Noting that current regulations do not provide sufficient guidance for developers or protection for users, the authors recommend that a single federal agency, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), coordinate the creation and enforcement of comprehensive privacy and security standards. In what follows, we summarize Hall and McGraw\u2019s key points and then discuss their implications based on our experience in creating, evaluating, and implementing telehealth systems. Hall and McGraw begin by describing the risks that telehealth systems pose to the privacy and security of patients\u2019 health information. Privacy risks involve a lack of control over the collection, use, and sharing of data. For example, home telehealth devices and sensors designed to detect falls may collect and t",

Current expectations forecast the U.S. market alone will exceed $46 billion dollars by 2025. Soon, every major healthcare network will eventually offer patients some form of telehealth services. And with the onset of this new technology, security safeguards for telemedicine are an absolute necessity. While this technological advancement is beneficial for patients and providers alike, it poses some potential problems\u2014namely, cyberthreats. Telemedicine requires the sharing and transmission of sensitive healthcare patient data. For cybercriminals, this presents an opportunity. Fortunately for you, the telehealth security threat can be minimized by utilizing cybersecurity best practices. The main goal? To keep your patients\u2019 private information secure. \u00a0 Security Safeguards for Telemedicine An IT breach harms your customers, business reputation, and bottom line. All it takes is one data leak for patients to lose trust in your organization. If that happens, their willingness to share electronic personal health information (ePHI) will diminish. To forestall this, many providers are adopting and implementing new cybersecurity policies focused on keeping patient information safe and secure. This is why it\u2019s vital that you integrate telemedicine security safeguards, such as: \u00a0 Application Security\u00a0 There are many applications needed for patients and physicians to facilitate, communicate, and share ePHI during a telehealth consultation. And the precipitate rise of telemedicine services has resulted in a bevy of new applications and platforms. Many of them have yet to be properly vetted for security. This exposes providers to telehealth security risks. In particular, IT teams are made largely impotent and ineffectual by this lack of control, especially if remote users update their applications immediately after a patch release.

Abstract Background The virulent and unpredictable nature of COVID-19 combined with a change in reimbursement mechanisms both forced and enabled the rapid adoption of telemedicine around the world. Thus, it is important to now assess the effects of this rapid adoption and to determine whether the barriers to such adoption are the same today as they were under prepandemic conditions. Objective The objective of this systematic literature review was to examine the research literature published during the COVID-19 pandemic to identify facilitators, barriers, and associated medical outcomes as a result of adopting telemedicine, and to determine if changes have occurred in the industry during this time. Methods The systematic review was p",

Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a significant shift in healthcare delivery, with telemedicine emerging as an important additional service provision channel. This study introduces a novel methodological framework, combining a multiperiod multivariate binary probit (MBP) system and a cross-sectional MBP system, to investigate telemedicine adoption trends, as well as the facilitators and deterrents of adoption. The analysis utilizes data from a three-wave COVID Future Survey (April 2020-November 2021), supplemented by population density and healthcare-related establishment data. The results reveal a generational digital divide, with older adults exhibiting lower adoption rates due to technological barriers and preferences for traditional healthcare interactions. The study also highlights the role of the presence of children, income, transportation access, employment status, and residential location characteristics in telemedicine adoption. Notably, individuals without vehicle access or living in areas with lower geographic accessibility to healthcare providers are more likely to adopt telemedicine, suggesting its potential to reduce he",

The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) further accelerated the deployment and utilization of telemedicine services. An analysis of the socioeconomic characteristics of telemedicine users to understand potential socioeconomic gaps and disparities is critical for improving the adoption of telemedicine services among patients. Objectives: This study aims to measure the correlation of socioeconomic determinants with the use of telemedicine services in Milwaukee metropolitan area. Methods: Electronic health record review of patients using telemedicine services compared with those not using telemedicine services within an academic-community health system: patient demographics (e.g., age, gender, race, and ethnicity), insurance status, and socioeconomic determinants obtained through block-level census data in Milwaukee area. The telemedicine users were compared with all other patients using regression analysis. The telemedicine adoption rates were calculated across regional ZIP codes to analyze the geographic patterns of telemedicine adoption.

Major health systems, including outpatient clinics and check-ups alike, turned to telehealth and teleconsultation amid the COVID19 pandemic. There are many recognized advantages of telehealth and its increasing implementation, however, not much is known about the specific impact of remote consultation on the quality of non-consultant hospital doctors (NCHD) training experiences in medicine. This study aimed to gain rich descriptive insights into the specific impact of remote consultation on the quality of medical NCHD training experiences and their perceptions, through purposeful sampling. Data was collected via semi-structured virtual interviews of fifteen NCHD participants. The interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using thematic analysis. The collective transcripts were analysed using NVIVO data software for common themes. The themes identified suggested that there were both advantages and disadvantages to telehealth and its impact on training across a spectrum of entities including; doctor-patient relationships, peer relationships, service provision, work morale, working hours, clinical skills experience and general feedback as a trainee. NCHD perspectives expressed were mixed across all themes. Further research is recommended to advance understanding of the potential impact of telehealth on current and prospective doctors in training. With a greater understanding of general insights, future changes, including telehealth training programmes, could be implemented to build confidence and familiarity with telehealth utilization and potentiate its conceivable benefits.

How does it affect patients' health and well-being compared to the alternatives? How do costs compare? Are patients and clinicians satisfied with the services? Would they want to use them in the future? Why or why not? These are the kinds of questions that clinicians, patients, managers, and policymakers want answered about telemedicine. This chapter focuses on questions about the quality, accessibility, cost, and acceptability of telemedicine services. Additional questions will, however, be relevant for some organizations, some communities, and some evaluations. For example, because many telemedicine programs also serve educational and administrative purposes, evaluations may reasonably seek to assess results in these areas. The committee's evaluation framework likewise provides for strategic objectives such as strengthening an organization's competitive positive.

This is particularly an issue where MRSA is a concern. Additionally, some patients who feel uncomfortable in a doctors office may do better remotely. For example, white coat syndrome may be avoided. Patients who are home-bound and would otherwise require an ambulance to move them to a clinic are also a consideration. The downsides of telemedicine include the cost of telecommunication and data management equipment and of technical training for medical personnel who will employ it. Virtual medical treatment also entails potentially decreased human interaction between medical professionals and patients, an increased risk of error when medical services are delivered in the absence of a registered professional, and an increased risk that protected health information may be compromised through electronic storage and transmission.[5] There is also a concern that telemedicine may actually decrease time efficiency due to the difficulties of assessing and treating patients through virtual interactions; for example, it has been estimated that a teledermat",

As a result, objective information about the benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine is limited. This review is therefore based mainly on preliminary results, opinions and predictions. Many potential benefits of telemedicine can be envisaged, including: improved access to information; provision of care not previously deliverable; improved access to services and increasing care delivery; improved professional education; quality control of screening programmes; and reduced health-care costs. Although telemedicine clearly has a wide range of potential benefits, it also has some disadvantages. The main ones that can be envisaged are: a breakdown in the relationship between health professional and patient; a breakdown in the relationship between health professionals; issues concerning the quality of health information; and organizational and bureaucratic difficulties. On balance, the benefits of telemedicine are substantial, assuming that more research will reduce or eliminate the obvious drawbacks.

Goede6 & Sarai Ambert-Pompey7,8\u00a0 263 Accesses 1 Altmetric Abstract Telemedicine adoption in clinical practice rapidly accelerated through 2020, requiring both faculty and learners to simultaneously navigate a new care delivery modality. In the setting of this rapid expansion, the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) established foundational competencies in telemedicine for recent medical school graduates, residency graduates, and practicing physicians. The academic medical practice provides learners both the clinical experience and faculty supervision to develop the necessary telemedicine skills. We aim to outline the role of the academic medical practice in the support of telemedicine education for medical students and residents. This chapter addresses important considerations for clinical practices, including competency-based telehealth education, recommendations for tailored experiences at both undergraduate medical education (UME) and graduate medical education (GME) levels, faculty development, and scheduling logistics.

Abstract Background Telemedicine has grown exponentially in the United States over the past few decades, and contemporary trends in the health care environment are serving to fuel this growth into the future. Therefore, medical schools are learning to incorporate telemedicine competencies into the undergraduate medical education of future physicians so that they can more effectively leverage telemedicine technologies for improving the quality of care, increasing patient access, and reducing health care expense. This review articulates the efforts of allopathic-degree-granting medical schools in the United States to characterize and systematize the learnings that have been generated thus far in the domain of telemedicine training in undergraduate medical education.

A meta-analysis was performed to compare the examination pass rate of medical students educated using VR and those receiving traditional education to evaluate the teaching effect of VR in medical education. Methods: The PubMed, Springer Link, Science Direct, and Wiley Online Library were searched from inception to May 2020. Articles meeting the inclusion criteria were then evaluated, relevant information extracted and a meta-analysis conducted. Students were allocated to a VR group, those trained using VR technology, and a traditional education group, those who received a traditional medical education. Results: Six studies were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicate a significant difference between the pass rate of stude",

Method: Five doctors who had been practicing internal medicine for 8 to 18 years, and twenty patients were enrolled in this study; neither doctors nor patients had previous experience of telemedicine. The patients received both a telemedicine consultation and a face-to-face consultation. Three measures--video observation, medical record volume, and participants' satisfaction--were used for the assessment. Results: It was found that the time spent on the telemedicine consultation was substantially longer than the time spent on the face-to-face consultation. No statistically significant differences were found in the number of either closed or open-ended questions asked by doctors between both types of consultation. Empathy-utterances, praise-utterances, and facilitation-utterances were, however, seen less in the telemedicine consultations than in the face-to-face consultations. The volume of the medical records was statistically smaller in the telemedicine consultations",

A total of 38 studies were identified: six were surveys of provider and community attitudes; 21 were post-encounter surveys of participants in a medical consultation; and 11 were qualitative analyses of behaviour in a medical encounter. Twenty-one of the 38 investigations originated in the USA, six in the UK, four in Australia, three in Norway, two in Canada, one in Finland and one in Sweden. All were relatively recent. The findings from each study were coded according to 23 categories developed from the literature and a positive or negative rating was assigned to each of the 213 communication results. Approximately 80% of abstracted findings favoured telemedicine, with all but two of the 23 categories analysed (non-verbal behaviour and lack of touch) reporting more positive than negative results. Verbal content analysis is important for the development of interventions aimed at facilitating doctor-patient telecommunication. However, further research is necessary if the nature and content of the communication process are to be fully understood.

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract In North America, telehealth increased by 40% between 2019 and 2020 and stabilized at 40% in 2021. As telehealth becomes more common, it is essential to ensure that healthcare providers have the required skills to overcome the challenges and barriers of this new modality of care. While the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the design and implementation of telehealth curricula in healthcare education programs, its general adoption is still a major gap and an important barrier to ensuring scaling up and sustainability of the telesshealth practice. Lack of experienced faculty and limited curricular time are two of the most common barriers to expanding telehealth education. Overcoming the barriers of telehealth curricula implementation may require moving away from the classic expert model of learning in which novices learn from experts. As the adoption of telehealth curricula is still in its early stages, institutions may need to plan for faculty development and trainee education at the same time. Questions regarding the timing and content of telehealth education, the interprofessional development of curricula, and the identification of optimal pedagogic",

Therefore, medical schools are learning to incorporate telemedicine competencies into the undergraduate medical education of future physicians so that they can more effectively leverage telemedicine technologies for improving the quality of care, increasing patient access, and reducing health care expense. This review articulates the efforts of allopathic-degree-granting medical schools in the United States to characterize and systematize the learnings that have been generated thus far in the domain of telemedicine training in undergraduate medical education. Objective The aim of this review was to collect and outline the current experiences and learnings that have been generated as medical schools have sought to implement telemedicine capacity-building into undergraduate medical education. Methods We performed a mixed-methods review, starting with a literature review via Scopus, tracking with Excel, and an email outreach effort utilizing telemedicine curriculum data gathered by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education. This outreach included 70 institutions and yielded 7 interviews, 4 peer-reviewed research papers, 6 online documents, and 3 completed survey responses. Results There is an emerging, rich international body of learning being generated in the field of telemedicine training in undergraduate medical education.

Abstract Medical education exists to prepare the physician workforce that our nation needs, but the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to disrupt that mission. Likewise, the national increase in awareness of social justice gaps in our country pointed out significant gaps in health care, medicine, and our medical education ecosystem. Crises in all industries often present leaders with no choice but to transform\u2014or to fail. In this perspective, the authors suggest that medical education is at such an inflection point and propose a transformational vision of the medical education ecosystem, followed by a 10-year, 10-point plan that focuses on building the workforce that will achieve that vision. Broad themes include adopting a national vision; enhancing medicine\u2019s role in social justice thr",

Received 2022 Jan 5; Accepted 2022 Mar 30; Issue date 2022 Sep. Abstract Telehealth visits have become an integral model of healthcare delivery since the COVID-19 pandemic. This rapid expansion of telehealthcare delivery has forced faculty development and trainee education in telehealth to occur simultaneously. In response, academic medical institutions have quickly implemented clinical training to teach digital health skills to providers across the medical education continuum. Yet, learners of all levels must still receive continual assessment and feedback on their skills to align with the telehealth competencies and milestones set forth by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). This paper discusses key educational needs and emerging areas for faculty development in telehealth teaching and assessment of telehealth competencies. It proposes strategies for the successful integration of the AAMC telehealth competencies and ACGME milestones into medical education, including skills in communication, data gathering, and patient safety with appropriate telehealth use. Direct observation tools in the paper offer educators novel instruments to assess telehealth competencies in medical students, residents, and peer faculty.

Abstract Purpose The use of telemedicine dramatically increased during the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0Assessing patient satisfaction with this mode of healthcare delivery is an important metric of success as it is broadly implemented across various settings. Of additional importance are the ways social determinants of health impact health outcomes, with the first step in determining the scale of this impact being the identification of contributing factors. This study assesses patient satisfaction with the medical and social aspects of the care they receive via telemedicine at a university-affiliated\u00a0primary care training clinic in Detroit, Michigan. Methods A survey was designed to assess patient satisfaction with the technical aspects of the visit, the visit itself, and with the social determinants screening tool used. During July 2020, 167 patients who had at least one telemedicine visit with a primary care physician from the clinic in the preceding months were contacted to assess their impression of the service provided. The responses were used to evaluate patient satisfaction w",

This article is an open access article distributed under the terms and conditions of the Creative Commons Attribution (CC BY) license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Abstract The challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic have led to the development of new hospital design strategies and models of care. To enhance staff safety while preserving patient safety and quality of care, hospitals have created a new model of remote inpatient care using telemedicine technologies. The design of the COVID-19 units divided the space into contaminated and clean zones and integrated a control room with audio-visual technologies to remotely supervise, communicate, and support the care being provided in the contaminated zone. The research is based on semi-structured interviews and observations of care processes that implemented a new model of inpatient telemedicine at Sheba Medical Center in Israel in different COVID-19 units, including an intensive care unit (ICU) and internal medicine unit (IMU). The study examines the impact of the diverse design layouts of the different units associated with the implementation of digital technologies for remote care on patient and staff safety. The results demonstrate the challenges and opportunities of int",

Loneliness in modern medicine: Confronting isolation in a connected world | Image Credit: \u00a9 pavel1964 - \u00a9 pavel1964 - stock.adobe.com. Loneliness may seem like an unusual topic for Contemporary OB/GYN, yet it is an issue with far-reaching implications, touching the lives of both patients and clinicians alike. In an increasingly digital and \u201cconnected\u201d world, loneliness is paradoxically on the rise, affecting health, resilience, and even patient outcomes. As obstetrics and gynecology practitioners, we need to recognize and address the impacts of loneliness, not only on those we care for but on ourselves as well. In recent years, loneliness has been recognized as a \u201cquiet epidemic,\u201d and the COVID-19 pandemic significantly intensified this issue. Social distancing, quarantine protocols, and the abrupt shift to remote or virtual connections left us feeling more isolated. This trend was particularly profound among new mothers who navigated childbirth and postpartum experiences with limited in-person support, high-risk patients who often managed their diagnoses alone, and older patients who were distanced from family. The US Surgeon General recently underscored the impact of these changes, identifying loneliness as a major public health issue. In fact, research now suggests that the impact of chronic loneliness on physical health may rival that of smoking or obesity, contributing to cardiovascular disease, anxiety, depression, and impaired immune function. Digital technology, though invaluable during the pandemic, has also had a double-edged effect on loneliness. Platforms like telemedicine enabled critical health care access but often lacked the personal touch of face-to-face interaction.

When isolation increased, telehealth use went down for older adults. Why? Study offers glimpse into disconnection that increases health risks During the COVID-19 pandemic, telehealth emerged as a lifeline for delivering health care services, ensuring patient safety while minimizing virus transmission. However, a UC Davis Health\u00a0study published\u00a0in the\u00a0Journal of the American Geriatrics Society\u00a0sheds light on disparities in telehealth access and use among older adults, particularly concerning social isolation and loneliness. These factors, often prevalent in the elderly population, have profound implications for overall health and well-being. Increased telehealth, decreased connection The study determined that rapid expansion of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic increased usage of the technology from 6% to 24% among people 70 years of age and older. A majority of participants (63%) reported some level of social isolation. Loneliness, measured with a single-item question, revealed that 26% of older adults felt lonely on some days, while 9% felt lonely most days or every day. \u201cWhen COVID was starting and telehealth use was accelerating, I realized there was a big difference between people who quickly adopted telehealth and patients who were really struggling and couldn",

This study examined relationships between loneliness and mental health among adults using a digital mental health platform. Methods: A purposive sample of 919 participants (97% response rate) who were newly enrolled in the platform completed a survey on loneliness, depression, anxiety, well-being, stress, social support, and comorbidities at baseline and 3 months. Platform engagement was tracked during this period. We examined baseline differences between lonely and non-lonely participants; associations between loneliness, mental health symptoms, and comorbidities; and changes in loneliness and mental health through engagement in any form of care. Results: At baseline, 57.8% of the sample were categorized as lonely. Loneliness was associated with younger age, fewer years of education, and the presence of a comorbidity (p values < .05). Baseline loneliness was associated with greater depression, anxiety, and stress and lower well-being and social support (ps < .001).

As healthcare providers and patients adapted to virtual care, telemedicine became a viable alternative to in-person visits. Remote health services provide increased access to care, especially for patients in rural or underserved areas, while also offering convenience and flexibility. However, there are also disadvantages to consider, such as privacy concerns, the quality of care, and technology limitations.

Increased Access to Care Telemedicine allows patients to receive care regardless of their geographic location, which is especially beneficial for those living in rural or underserved areas. Virtual care reduces barriers to accessing healthcare services, ensuring that more people can get the treatment they need.

But even before this pandemic, telemedicine provided a way for patients to connect with a doctor when they could not physically get to a doctor\u2019s office or hospital. For instance, telemedicine is great for patients who are geographically isolated, too sick to travel, or without transportation. The convenience of Telemedicine offers many advantages for caregivers. However, before you schedule a virtual appointment for your loved one, consider the benefits and drawbacks of telemedicine. What exactly is telemedicine? Telehealth is the broad term for all healthcare services that use telecommunications, including telephone alerts regarding disease outbreaks. Telemedicine, a subset of telehealth, is the use of telecommunications to provide clinical services to patients. (Although it\u2019s worth noting that people use these terms interchangeably.) For telemedicine appointments, doctors and other healthcare professionals conduct virtual appointments with patients via phone or video. You may even be able to send photos via integrated software, allowing doctors to see areas of concern more clearly, such as moles, burns or bruises. Additionally, telemedicine may include the use of at home monitoring systems that make it easy for doctors to track a patient\u2019s important health parameters, such as heart rate and blood pressure. There are 2 avenues for telemedicine services. Many doctors use phone and video appointments with their patients, allowing you to have a virtual appointment with your own doctor at a prescheduled time. On the other hand, large telemedicine companies, like Teladoc and Amwell, employ doctors who never see patients in person. When using a service like this, you will meet with doctors you do not know. Your doctor may use a 3rd party telemedicine company to handle their virtual appointments, or your employer may provide access to these",

Recent Findings The use of TM will expand only if patients and providers are at least as satisfied with it as they are with in-person visits. Since deviations from expected care can result in reduced satisfaction regardless of the quality of the visit or objective medical outcomes, it is important to understand and to help form those expectations when possible. Patients consistently report 95\u2013100% satisfaction rate with TM when compared with in-person appointments. They tend to cite the convenience of decreased travel times and costs as the main drivers for satisfaction with TM. Providers tend to be satisfied with TM if they have input into its development, there is administrative support, the technology is reliable and easy to use, and if there is adequate reimbursement for its use. Summary Satisfaction with TM is necessary for adoption of this new technology. To improve satisfaction it is important to consider factors that drive it both for patients and for providers.

It is unclear how social isolation and loneliness, which have previously been linked with poor health outcomes, may be associated with telehealth use. Objective: To assess the rates of telehealth use in a Medicare population and explore possible determinants of telehealth use, including social isolation and loneliness. Study Design and Analysis: Cross-sectional analysis; logistic regression to test association Dataset: National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS), 2020, including COVID supplement. NHATS is an annual survey of a nationally representative sample of Medicare enrollees. The COVID supplement was collected as a mail survey of NHATS participants from June 2020 to January 2021, with data released in July 2021. Population Studied: Medicare beneficiaries aged 70 years and older who completed both core NHATS questions and the COVID supplement. Main and Secondary Outcome Measures: Main outcome (dependent variable) is video visit usage (ever or never used). Key predictors (independent variables) are social isolation (based on Berkman and Syme\u2019s Social Network Index) and loneliness (direct measure). Covariates are self-reported health status, mobility difficulty, and sociodemographics. Results: Among the 2309 participants, video visit usage increased from 6% prior to COVID to 24% during COVID. The majority of participants were somewhat isolated (63%), with fewer either least isolated (18%) or most isolated (19%). Similarly, 65% of participants felt lonely on some days (65%), compared to rarely/never (26%) or most/every day (9%). Participants who are most isolated are significantly less likely to use video visits (aOR 0.49, CI 0.29-0.83). Loneliness was not significantly associated with video visit us",

It was only until the coronavirus outbreak that telemedicine became hugely popular and widely accepted. As more people embrace telemedicine, it continues to evolve and further impact the healthcare industry. One significant impact of telemedicine is how it transforms the patient-doctor relationship in a positive manner.\u00a0 Telemedicine: A Practical Healthcare Option The Health Resources and Services Administration of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines telemedicine as the use of telecommunications and electronic information technologies that aim to promote long-distance health care, public health administration, and patient and professional health-related education.\u00a0 The technologies include the Internet, streaming media, store-and-forward imaging, video conferencing, terrestrial and wireless communications, and mobile technology.\u00a0 Studies show telemedicine as an equally effective replacement for in-person visits in diagnosing and managing specific medical conditions, such as acute childhood illness, minor injuries, and respiratory problems, as early detection of COVID-19 infection. The pandemic has helped demonstrate how telemedicine is a practical option for on-demand healthcare and accelerated a broader reach throughout the country. Experts maintain the irreplaceable value and effectiveness of a doctor\u2019s actual touch. Telemedicine extends this touch as a practical option for patients to access and receive care. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC), for example, outlines potential uses of remote access to healthcare at times when an in-person visit is not practical or feasible, such as via telemedicine: The rapid growth of people adopting telemedicine services results from advancements in technology and how health care providers (HCPs) deliver successful healthcare outcomes.

August 16, 2021 Virtual care and telemedicine have been propelled to the forefront of healthcare provision because of the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, healthcare providers, doctors and patients are all looking to what this means for the future of care provision and doctor-patient relationships. There is no doubt that technology has played a huge role in helping healthcare providers to adapt to the new way of life that has been bought about by COVID. Replacing face-to-face contact with virtual and digital interactions has allowed doctors to continue caring for patients despite the significant strains placed on healthcare systems because of the pandemic. Growing patient acceptance of telemedicine In 2019, a survey undertaken by leading U.S. telemedicine provider Vivify found that only 17% of Americans said that they had access to remote care. In 2020, that figure rose to a massive 70% of respondents reporting that at least one of their providers now offers telehealth services. Alongside that increase in access has also come an increase in acceptance of telemedicine offerings, as patients embrace virtual care visits across all facets of healthcare. In that same survey, 66% of respondents suggested that virtual visits would be sufficient to address some of their medical concerns and an additional 27% suggested that most of their medical needs could be met using telemedicine technologies. Telemedicine and the changing face of doctor-patient relationships When this topic was discussed at one of our recent monthly HealthTech RapidConf events, by members of our HealthTech Networking Club, Dr. Paula Muto, CEO of UBERDOC, highlighted how the concept of connected care is nothing new, with doctors and patients having had the ability to interact via telephone for decades. However, it is technology that has enabled us to develop and monetize that phone call. \u201cImprovements in technologies, in terms of efficiency an",

Introduction A.C., a friendly Italian man, received coronary stents 8 years ago and had been feeling well until 3 months ago. He then had progressive breathing difficulty with tightness in his chest. He had loss of appetite and lost 4 kg in that period, but continued to work with good disposition. He had been to two hospital visits, in which he was informed that his lung was normal, based on X-ray. They had not reached final diagnosis, so he came to the office. His general appearance was normal; no abnormality was found on visual inspection. He had normal vital signs; no pallor to suggest anemia. The lungs, heart, abdomen and lower limbs were normal on examination, and resting ECG revealed no abnormalities either. As I palpated his neck, I noticed a mass on the left side. Subsequent examinations proved that a tumor compressed the trachea, which explained his respiratory difficulty. This is a typical example of a case in which only complete cli",

But how does this digital transformation affect the traditional doctor-patient relationship? This comprehensive article delves into the multifaceted impacts of telemedicine, highlighting both its benefits and challenges. \u00a0 The Evolution of Telemedicine Telemedicine has evolved significantly over the past few decades. Initially, it was a tool for reaching patients in remote areas, but today, it encompasses a wide range of services including virtual consultations, remote monitoring, and mobile health apps. This evolution has been driven by advancements in technology and the increasing demand for accessible healthcare. \u00a0 Enhancing Access to Healthcare \u00a0 One of the most significant benefits of telemedicine is its ability to break down geographical barriers. Patients in rural or underserved areas can now access specialists and receive high-quality care without the need to travel long distances. This not only saves time and money but also ensures that patients receive timely medical attention. \u00a0 Telemedicine offers flexible scheduling options that accommodate the busy lives of both patients and doctors. Virtual appointments can be scheduled outside of traditional office hours, making it easier for patients to seek medical advice without disrupting their daily routines. \u00a0 Improving Patient Engagement and Satisfaction \u00a0 Through telemedicine, doctors can provide more personalized care by using patient data and health records stored electronically. This allows for a more tailored approach to treatment, as doctors can easily access and review a patient\u2019s medical history during consultations. \u00a0 Patients often find virtual consultations more convenient and less intimidating than in-person visits.

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Meta-analyses have examined the reliability (ie, concordance) of assessment and the efficacy/effectiveness of telemental health compared with in-person care. Results indicate that telemental health assessment and clinical outcomes are similar compared with in-person care but there is much unexplained variability, as well as evidence that patient clinical and demographic characteristics can influence these findings. Further, gaps exist in the literature regarding specific patient populations (eg, psychotic disorders, children/adolescents), treatment modalities (eg, group therapy), audio only telemedicine, and hybrid care that mixes in-person with telemental health care. These gaps provide important directions for the next generation of telemental health research. Comprehensive clinical guidelines from mental health organizations are available to telemental health practitioners and focus on five content themes: legal and regulatory issues, clinical considerations, standard operating procedures and protocols, technical requirements, and considerations of specific populations and settings. Introduction Before the covid-19 pandemic, the use of telemedicine (ie, care delivered via videoconferencing or phone/audio only) had been increasing in mental healthcare but was not prevalent.123 The pandemic, with its pressure to enact social distancing when possible and a concomitant relaxation of healthcare payment and regulatory policies to facilitate rapid adoption of telemedicine, vastly accelerated its use, particularly for the care of mental health conditions.45678 Several terms have been used to describe the delivery of mental healthcare via telemedicine, including telemental health, telepsychology, telepsychiatry, and teletherapy.

So far, the studies show varying results. Less attention has been paid to systemic factors, such as the context, implementation, and mechanisms of these interventions. Methods This study evaluates the experiences of patients and health personnel enrolled in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial comparing telemedicine-based follow-up of chronic conditions with usual care. Patients in the intervention group received an individual treatment plan together with computer tablets and home telemonitoring devices to report point-of-care measurements, e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose or oxygen saturation, and to respond to health related questions reported to a follow-up service. In response to abnormal measurement results, a follow-up service nurse would contact the patient and consider relevant actions. We conducted 49 interviews with patients and 77 interviews with health personnel and managers at the local centers. The interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis and based on recommendations for conducting process evaluation, considering three core aspects within the process of delivering a complex intervention: (1) context, (2) implementation, and (3) mechanisms of impact. Results Patients were mainly satisfied with the telemedicine-based service, and experienced increased safety and understanding of their symptoms and illness. Implementation of the service does, however, require dedicated resources over time. S",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Objective This randomized controlled trial and embedded qualitative study aims to evaluate the impact on and experiences of patients and health care providers (HCPs) using a telemonitoring system with decision support to manage patients with complex conditions, including those with multiple chronic conditions, compared with the standard of care. Methods A pragmatic, unblinded, 6-month randomized controlled trial sought to recruit 146 patients with \u22651 diagnosis of heart failure (HF), uncontrolled hypertension (HT), and insulin-requiring diabetes mellitus (DM) from outpatient specialty settings in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. Participants were randomized into the control and telemonitoring groups, with the latter being instructed to take readings relevant to their conditions. The telemonitoring system contained an algorithm that generated decision support in the form of actionable self-care directives to patients and alerts to HCPs. The primary outcome was health status (36-Item Short Form Health Survey questionnaire). Secondary outcomes included anxiety and depression, self-",

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Primary site navigation Logged in as: PERMALINK Preserving the human touch in medicine in a digital age Sarah Brown When a doctor at the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Fremont, California, used a rolling video-technology \u201crobot\u201d to inform a patient that he was dying, the story went viral. The coldness of the delivery sparked outrage, but it also touched off a valuable debate on the importance of preserving a human presence in medicine and how to safeguard compassion in the telemedicine age. Dr. Brett Belchetz, the CEO of Maple, a Toronto-based platform that enables virtual health care, knew the Kaiser story would lead to questions about Maple\u2019s virtual medicine pilot at Western Hospital in Prince Edward Island. The \u201ctelerounding\u201d pilot sees a remote doctor doing daily rounds through video link to compensate for a physician shortage. Like at Kaiser, Maple operates a mobile cart that\u2019s wheeled from room to room by nurses. \u201cTelemedicine done right comes down to a person-to-person interaction,\u201d said Belchetz. \u201cIt\u2019s one human being talking to another, and if you talk to another human being compassionately and appropriately, it will go well.

Yet, while the need for telehealth becomes more pressing, the cost of telehealth implementation for healthcare providers includes many hidden charges and must be carefully estimated before adoption. Is your cost for implementing and maintaining telehealth solutions within a reasonable range? And, more importantly, do the benefits outweigh the costs? If you have doubts, you\u2019ve come to the right place!\u00a0 In this blog post, we will share our in-depth insights into the cost of telehealth system development. We\u2019ll break down the factors impacting the price, provide a market overview, and explain how the benefits of investing in telemedicine justify the costs. Why You Should View Telemedicine System As an Opportunity The telemedicine market was significantly reshaped by COVID-19. Even though we are out of the pandemic, providers are now considering telehealth systems more seriously than ever before, primarily for the reasons below. The pandemic has underscored the need for remote healthcare solutions. Telemedicine systems mitigate the risk of virus transmission by reducing physical visits and ensure continued care during such unprecedented crises. In fact, during the height of the pandemic, NYU Langone, located at the heart of the U.S. outbreak, had approximately 7,000 video visits daily. In April alone, they recorded around 100,000 video visits, a stark contrast to the pre-pandemic average of about 300 visits per day. Telehealth enables patients to remotely communicate with their healthcare providers, eliminating the necessity for travel and decreasing the time spent waiting. A recent study shows that 83% of patients who engaged in a telemedicine visit in the previous year are willing to keep and increase their use of telemedicine in the future. Additionally, nearly 76% of patients who had a telemedicine visit reported i",

This opinion is especially prevalent for FFS Medicare. Recent data provided to the TTP challenge some of these assumptions. A small silver lining of the pandemic has been the generation of first-ever Medicare fee-for-service data that allows budget analysts, including the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Office of Management and Budget and the CMS Actuary to begin to assess telehealth\u2019s impact on Medicare more accurately. Policymakers will, of course, want further analysis of how much COVID-induced care avoidance may have contributed to telehealth\u2019s impact on utilization during the pandemic. However, data generated from provider organizations and the federal government to date show that total healthcare utilization remained steady during telehealth\u2019s expansion and did not substantiate concerns about supply-induced demand. For example, an HHS Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation (ASPE) Medicare FFS telehealth report found that from mid-March through early-July more than 10.1 million traditional Medicare beneficiaries used telehealth.1 That includes nearly 50% of primary care visits conducted via telehealth in April vs. less than 1% before COVID-19. However, the net number of Medicare FFS primary care in-person and telehealth visits combined remained below pre-pandemic levels. As in-person care began to resume in May, telehealth visits dropped to 30% but there was still no net visit increase. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on patients seeking or avoiding care still need further analysis, but these data suggest that telehealth substituted for in-person care without increasing utilization. Other sources mirror ASPE\u2019s findings. The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs researchers found that, from March",

Today, nearly two years into the pandemic, there is no doubt that telehealth has gone mainstream, solidifying the category of hybrid care. Once limited by low adoption rates resulting from limited awareness and lack of favorable reimbursements, telehealth has increased care access and convenience in an environment that has demanded virtual care. However, although much of the discourse around telehealth rightfully focuses on its benefits, the potential drawbacks and limitations are often glossed over, particularly around provider burden. The reality is that telehealth is not a regular office visit conducted virtually. Rather, it\u2019s an entirely different experience for both the provider and patient. Providers accustomed to treating patients in person have become burdened by being forced to offer virtual care, with its potential technology related issues, informal nature and inability to physically engage with patients. Virtual care also can exacerbate, rather than alleviate, burnout. In the 2021 Medical Economics\u00ae Physician Burnout and Wellness Survey, 80% of physician respondents reported they are burned out, with 31% citing too much paperwork and bureaucratic tasks and 24% reporting too many hours worked and poor work-life balance as the cause. Compounded by the ongoing pandemic and added telehealth appointments, the result is an exhausted and burned-out health care workforce. For those outside of health care, think of the immediacy of Zoom meetings with the added stress of a patient\u2019s health and their concerns always one click away. The economics of telehealth also can create burdens. Shifting patients from in-person to virtu",

Methods: We recruited adult patients (n\u2009=\u200965) and primary care providers (n\u2009=\u200921) across 4 medical centers that were part of the National Patient-Centered Clinical Research Consortium Network in 3 states (New York, North Carolina, and Florida) between March and October 2021. An inductive approach was applied to coding. Transcripts were analyzed for themes relating to financial issues around telemedicine use. Results: Provider and patient perspectives on financial issues that influenced use of telemedicine differed. Provider concerns were associated with reimbursement, whereas patients were mainly concerned about out-of-pocket costs. Three major themes emerged: (1) relaxing reimbursement regulations alleviated the burden of uncompensated work for providers, (2) reimbursement will determine sustainability of telemedicine, and (3) telemedicine addresses some cost concerns for patients. Conclusions: Policy changes that supported financing of telemedicine catalyzed the rapid expansion of telemedicine to offset reduced in-person patient encounters during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sustainability of telemedicine will likely depen",

Barthelemy Many healthcare organizations (HCOs) have rushed to implement telehealth programs in response to COVID-19. But do the number of virtual consults translate to revenue? Best to ask providers who have been early adopters of telehealth (pre-COVID) as they are most certainly reaping the financial benefits of these programs. Following are just five case examples. Copper Queen Community Hospital Bisbee\u2019s Copper Queen Community Hospital got a boost to their financial health \u2013 thanks to telemedicine. The first program, telestroke, was implemented in collaboration with the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix. Copper Queen CEO Jim Dickson\u2019s forward-thinking vision allowed the hospital to add telecardiology, teleneurology, teleburn and telepediatrics, among other programs. The telemedicine program increased revenue by keeping patients local and has saved the small hospital significant money with their telecardiology program alone having saved more than $1.4 million in its first six months. Texas Department of Criminal Justice The Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) operates more than 30 state prison facilities, most in remote areas. Transporting inmates out of the prison to a hospital or physician\u2019s office presents considerable security risks and expense \u2014 each one-way trip costs roughly $350. Since beginning its corrections telemedicine program, TDCJ has reduced unnecessary medical tests and transfers to outside medical facilities; it\u2019s also boosted preventive care and successfully weeded out offenders who fake an illness or injury. 85 percent of Texas inmates stayed at the prison ",

Even though tracking the actual ROI and impact is challenging, the benefits of telehealth are tangible right after its adoption. It reduces patient costs and brings many advantages that indirectly optimize expenses, such as serving more patients in less time. Besides, telehealth services receive strong governmental support in many countries, including the US. In the last 5 years, 18 states passed laws to add audio-only telehealth coverage to health plans. Moreover, since 2020, Medicare has started covering more telehealth services, some of which at a lower rate.\u00a0 What does it have to do with the cost? In fact, a lot.\u00a0 These initiatives stimulate the broader provision of telehealth and its accessibility for patients. It becomes a cost-effective solution for physicians and providers to treat patients and arrange their workflows. Read more about telemedicine costs and benefits below. Healthcare Expenses Overview and Why are Telehealth Cost Savings So Important Telehealth software development is showing consistent, year-over-year growth. Think of it, in 2027, it\u2019s expected to reach $559,52 billion in the USA. As federal funding for Medicare and Medicaid increases, new opportunities for healthcare businesses also emerge. However, there is another side to it. The USA is a leader among the countries in terms of healthcare spending per person. In 2022, healthcare spending in the US almost reached $4.5 trillion, averaging $13,493 per person. This accounted for 17.3% of the country\u2019s GDP. By comparison, other wealthy nations spend significantly less per capita on healthcare. For instance, health expenditures per person in comparable high-income countries averaged about $6,651, making US spending more than twice as high as the average of these countries.

Cost-Effective Care Delivery The term refers to the provision of healthcare services in a manner that maximizes quality of care while minimizing cost. There are various approaches to this medicine, including the use of telemedicine, care coordination, disease prevention and management, and the implementation of evidence-based practices. Here are some examples of reducing costs via telehealth. Reduced travel costs Telehealth eliminates the need for patients to travel to hospitals, which can be especially beneficial for those who live in rural areas. This can save patients money on transportation costs, as well as reduce the need for time off work. Patients can access healthcare services from the comfort of their own homes and save fuel, money for parking, and public transportation fares. Overall, telehealth has the potential to make primary care more accessible and affordable for patients who would otherwise have to travel long distances to receive it.

The researchers examined nearly 11,000 visits for adult employees and their dependents who used the Penn Medicine-sponsored insurance plan between July 7, 2017, and December 31, 2019. They compared about 5,400 visits conducted via the on-demand telemedicine service to about 5,400 visits that were conducted in-person during the same period. The research team found that the per-visit costs for Penn Medicine OnDemand averaged $380. In-person encounters for the same conditions \u2014 which took place in primary care offices, emergency departments or urgent care clinics \u2014 cost $493 to conduct on average. This represents a $113 difference per patient. During the study period, there was a 10% increase in demand for telemedicine services, but there was also a 23% reduction in the overall \u201cunit cost\u201d per service \u2014 which factors in things like provider salaries and the equipment expenses. This means that telemedicine is less expensive to provide for Penn Medicine, as well as a more ac",

With tens of millions of Americans suddenly cut off from clinicians, policymakers rushed to relax regulations related to telehealth. These changes allowed quarantined Americans to get in touch with their providers virtually, via video or telephone, for everything from routine primary care visits to consults with cardiologists. The rapid regulatory changes left some skeptical. Payors \u2014 insurance companies \u2014 in particular were worried that increased access would result in increased fraud and overuse, and would send already elevated health care costs even higher. They were wrong. A new report from Americans for Prosperity and the Progressive Policy Institute that analyzed data from FAIR Health found that the more patients use telehealth, the more affordable it becomes. \u201cPanic over emerging technology is nothing new, but this report shows that the main concerns surrounding virtual care are not supported by evidence,\u201d said\u00a0Charlie Katebi, health policy analyst at Americans for Prosperity and co-author of the report along with Arielle Kane, director of public policy at the Progress Policy Institute. \u201cTelehealth proved to be a godsend during the pandemic \u2013 not just because it kept Americans connected to their doctors, but because it saved t",

How does it affect patients' health and well-being compared to the alternatives? How do costs compare? Are patients and clinicians satisfied with the services? Would they want to use them in the future? Why or why not? These are the kinds of questions that clinicians, patients, managers, and policymakers want answered about telemedicine. This chapter focuses on questions about the quality, accessibility, cost, and acceptability of telemedicine services. Additional questions will, however, be relevant for some organizations, some communities, and some evaluations. For example, because many telemedicine programs also serve educational and administrative purposes, evaluations may reasonably seek to assess results in these areas. The committee's evaluation framework likewise provides for strategic objectives such as strengthening an organization's competitive positive.

Abstract Background Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.

Several networks provide services in different settings and in different ways. However, to draw conclusions about which telemedicine networks are successful requires a method of evaluating them. No general consensus or validated framework exists for this purpose. Objective To define a basic method of performance measurement that can be used to improve and compare teleconsultation networks; to employ the proposed framework in an evaluation of three existing networks; to make recommendations about the future implementation and follow-up of such networks. Methods Analysis based on the experience of three telemedicine networks (in operation for 7\u201310 years) that provide services to doctors in low-resource settings and which employ the same basic design. Findings Although there are many possible indicators and metrics that might be relevant, five measures for each of the three user groups appear to be sufficient for the proposed framework. In addition, from the societal perspective, information about clinical- and cost-effectiveness is also required. The proposed performance me",

Telemedicine can enhance interactions among providers to improve patient care, support provider-to-provider training, enhance service capacity and quality (such as in small rural hospital emergency departments and pharmacy services), manage patients with multiple chronic conditions from a distance, and remotely monitor patient health and activities.3 Four Types of Telemedicine Telehealth has four main types of technology: live video, store-and-forward, remote patient monitoring, and mobile health.4 Telemedicine Benefits This review of the evidence focuses on the first three types of technology as they are pertinent to telemedicine: synchronous and asynchronous data transmissions and remote patient monitoring. These uses of telemedicine have been shown to offer numerous benefits, including:7 Telemedicine Barriers and Limitations While many benefits of telemedicine have been identified, there are still barriers to states adopting or expanding this method of healthcare:16\u00a0 Medicare offers the most limited coverage of telemedicine; they only cover a narrow set of services and only in rural areas.22\u00a0Healthcare providers have to meet a number of provisions to qualify for telemedicine and telemedicine reimbursement under Medicare. They must be one of 10 qualifying distant site practitioners in a federally designated rural zone; the patient must be in a federally designated rural zone; and they must be using a real-time audio-visual platform.23 These restrictions have become a barrier to many providers, especially if they were to broaden their telemedicine practice.

However, there is a limited understanding of the use of telemedicine and its association with direct medical costs. Objectives: Using nationally representative data, we investigated telemedicine use and the associated direct medical costs among respondents overall and stratified by medical provider type and patient insurance status. Research design, subjects, and measures: We used the 2020 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey full-year consolidated file, and outpatient department (OP) and office-based (OB) medical provider event files. Outcomes included total and out-of-pocket costs per visit for OP and OB. The primary independent variable was a binary variable indicating visits made through any telemedicine modality. We used multivariable generalized linear models and 2-part models, adjusting for types of providers and care, patient characteristics, and survey design. Results: Among total OP (n = 2938) and OB (n = 20,204) visits, 47.6% and 24.7% of visits, respectively were made through telemedicine. For OP, telemedicine visits were associated with lower total costs (average marginal effect: -$228;",

When the COVID-19 pandemic began in 2020, there was a large shift in patients from in-person care to telehealth due to over-crowded hospitals, lack of in-person provider availability and fears about the spread of coronavirus in waiting rooms.

People living in rural areas or remote parts of the country benefit from virtual care. While it might not be the best option for chronic disease management, it\u2019s better than no medical care at all. Telehealth appointments are also great for people who have mobility issues or have a difficult time getting to appointments because of a lack of reliable transportation. Telehealth visits are also an excellent option for those who need mental health counseling. Behavioral health visits are more private and confidential when you connect with a doctor virtually. Finally, telehealth services are excellent for people who are immunocompromised.

Written by Editorial Team Medically Reviewed by Dr Gowtham Chowdary Kankanala on Fri, 04 Oct 2024 Health topics Share this: The healthcare landscape has dramatically changed. With the rise of technology, telemedicine has become a popular option for many patients. But is it really better than traditional in-person visits? In this blog, we\u2019ll explore both options to help you make an informed decision. Understanding Telemedicine Telemedicine refers to the practice of providing healthcare services remotely, typically through video calls, phone calls, or messaging. Patients can connect with their doctors from the comfort of their homes. This method has gained popularity due to its convenience and accessibility. Here are some key features: Convenience: You can schedule appointments at times that suit you, eliminating the need to travel. Accessibility: People living in rural or underserved areas can access healthcare services that may not be available locally. Reduced Waiting Times: Telemedicine often has shorter waiting times compared to traditional clinics. Safety: During situations like the COVID-19 pandemic, telemedicine reduces the risk of exposure to illnesses. The Benefits of Telemedicine Telemedicine has several advantages that make it a compelling choice for many patients: Need an Appointment? Click here Comfort: For many people, visiting a doctor\u2019s office can be stressful. Telemedicine allows patients to have appointments in a familiar environment, which can help reduce anxiety.

Two of the most popular forms are telehealth and in-person healthcare. Telehealth is a way of receiving medical treatment through technology, such as video conferencing or texting. In-person healthcare, on the other hand, is the traditional route of visiting a doctor\u2019s office or hospital. As more and more people lean towards telehealth, it\u2019s essential to understand the benefits and drawbacks of both options. Telehealth presents many benefits, such as convenience, access to specialists, and saving time by eliminating the need for travel. But is it as safe and effective as in-person healthcare? In this comprehensive comparison, we\u2019ll explore both options and provide the information needed to decide on your healthcare needs. Accessibility and Convenience Telehealth and in-person healthcare both have their unique advantages and limitations when it comes to accessibility and convenience. Availability and Advantages of Telehealth Telehealth is a method of receiving healthcare services through electronic communication, including virtual visits, online therapy, remote monitoring, and mobile health services. One of the most significant advantages of telehealth is its flexibility and convenience for patients. Patients can receive medical advice, diagnosis, and treatment without leaving home. This is particularly beneficial for people who live in rural areas, have mobility issues, or don\u2019t have access to reliable transportation. Another advantage of telehealth is that it reduces the risk of exposure to contagious diseases. In addition, patients who are sick or have weakened immune systems can avoid exposure to other patients in healthcare facilities by electing to receive care remotely. Limitations of In-Person Healthcare In-person healthcare has some limitations in terms of accessibility and convenience.

Palmer3\u00a0 792 Accesses Abstract Tele-ICU implementation costs can be significant, and it is important for organizations to understand the various components of the costs involved. A careful cost-benefit analysis is highly recommended given the unique needs and goals of each organization. In the absence of direct commercial revenues from insurers for patient encounters via tele-ICU services, organizations might consider evaluating financial benefits in a more global context factoring in indirect revenue sources, cost avoidance, and cost reductions due to enhanced efficiency of service delivery. In order to demonstrate tangible financial benefits, deep integration into bedside ICU services is essential. This chapter provides an overview of implementation costs, revenue sources, and a framework for cost-benefit analysis for tele-ICU implementation.

Abstract Telemedicine uses digital technologies to provide healthcare services remotely, greatly improving patient access, especially during crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. This systematic review investigates telemedicine's effects on patient outcomes, access to care, and its role in the evolving healthcare landscape. Relevant studies were identified using MeSH terms and keywords through electronic databases and manual reference list screenings. The selected empirical studies, both quantitative and qualitative, examined telemedicine across various patient populations.\u00a0The review categorized findings into themes related to patient outcomes and access to care. Telemedicine was found to be a transformative tool in chronic disease management, particularly in diabetes care. Significant improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings were reported with telemedicine interventions. For example, telehealth platforms enhance diabetes management by increasing patient engag",

Abstract Background Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.

Design: Systematic review of English language, peer reviewed journal articles. Data sources: Searches of Medline, Embase, ISI citation indexes, and database of Telemedicine Information Exchange. Studies selected: 55 of 612 identified articles that presented actual cost benefit data. Main outcome measures: Scientific quality of reports assessed by use of an established instrument for adjudicating on the quality of economic analyses. Results: 557 articles without cost data categorised by topic. 55 articles with data initially categorised by cost variables employed in the study and conclusions. Only 24/55 (44%) studies met quality criteria justifying inclusion in a quality review. 20/24 (83%) restricted to simple cost comparisons. No study used cost utility analysis, the conventional means of establishing the \u201cvalue for money\u201d that a therapeutic intervention represents. Only 7/24 (29%) studies attempted to explore the level of utilisation that would be needed for telemedicine services to compare favourably with traditionally organised health care. None addressed this question in sufficient detail to adequately answer it. 15/24 (62.5%) of articles reviewed here provided no details of sensitivity analysis, a method all economic analyses should incorporate. Conclusion: There is no good evidence that telemedicine is a cost effective means of delivering health care. The use of telemedicine has garnered much attention in the past decade Hundreds of articles have been published claiming that telemedicine is cost effective However, missing from the literature is a synthesis or meta-analysis of these publications A comprehensive literature search of cost related articles on telemedicine identified more than 600 articles, but only 9% contained any cost benefit data Only 4% of these articles met quality criteria justif",

Patients and health care providers may encounter a patchwork of arbitrary insurance requirements and disparate payment streams that do not allow them to fully take advantage of telemedicine. The American Telemedicine Association (ATA) has captured the complex policy landscape of 50 states with 50 different telemedicine policies, and translated this information into an easy to use format.\u00a0 This report complements our 50 State Gaps Analysis:\u00a0 Physician Practice Standards\u00a0& Licensure, and extracts and compares telemedicine coverage and reimbursement standards for every state in the U.S. ultimately leaving each state with two questions: Using data categorized into 13 indicators related to coverage and reimbursement, our analysis continues to reveal a mix of strides and stagnation in state-\u00ad\u2010based policy despite decades of evidence-\u00ad\u2010based research highlighting positive clinical outcomes and increasing telemedicine utilization. Since our initial report in September 2014 11 states and D.C. have adopted policies that improved coverage and reimbursement of telemedicine-\u00ad\u2010provided services, while two states have adopted policies further restricting coverage (Figure 1).1 States have made efforts to improve their grades through the removal of arbitrary restrictions and adoption of laws ensuring coverage parity under private insurance, state employee health plans, and/or Medicaid plans, as indicated in Figure 2. Overall, there are more states now with above average grades, \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d, including Iowa which improved from an \u2018F\u2019 to \u2018B\u2019, than reported in September 2014.

In an effort to try and simplify the vast amount of information regarding telemedicine policy, the ATA has assigned a grade to each U.S. state based on the presence of policies that block physicians, patients, and providers from utilizing the advantages of telemedicine. The assessment of each state regarding physician-patient encounter revolved around telemedicine usage before, during, and after a physician\u2019s encounter with a patient. Some states require an in-person visit must be conducted alongside communication via telemedicine when treating a patient. These state policies have a direct effect on the physician\u2019s ability to practice medicine, unlike legislation and policies regarding reimbursement and coverage. The results of the analysis indicate a mixed result of progression and stagnation among each state. \u201cSince the first version of this report in 2014, medical boards have moved towards a trend to impose different regulations or guidance for medical practice via telemedicine when compared to in-person practice,\u201d the report says. \u201cFurther, states are becoming more prescriptive in their requirements for an additional patient informed consent and the types of modalities permitted for appropriate clinical practice when using telemedicine.\u201d Over the past year, more than 25 states have speculated to make changes to the physician standards and licensure regulations regarding telemedicine in order to further its expansion. Given varying results, certain states are implementing new legislation that influence\u2019s more access for physicians and patients via telemedicine while other states make moves towards simply altering policies already in place that only hinder the adoption of telemedicine.

                    "The argument that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities fails to address the very real ways in which it exacerbates them.  Firstly, the UCLA study on making telemedicine accessible underscores that underserved populations, who already face significant barriers to in-person care due to factors like needing unpaid time off work, are further disadvantaged by lacking reliable technology access needed for telemedicine. This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating an additional barrier by adding a technological layer to the already existing socioeconomic ones. Secondly, even when addressing cost, as some studies suggest telemedicine can do, the issue of digital literacy remains. A study in ScienceDirect validates that demographics such as lower education and income levels correlate with lower digital literacy. Thus, even if technology were provided, the skills to effectively navigate these platforms would still be lacking, thereby limiting the potential benefits of telemedicine for these populations and ultimately widening the digital divide. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount for true equitable healthcare."

Your role is to present persuasive arguments, respond to opposing viewpoints, and engage in critical thinking. \n\n## Guidelines:\n1. Stance: You will be assigned a position (either for or against) on the given topic. Regardless of your personal beliefs, argue convincingly for your assigned stance.\n2. Structure: Use a clear structure in your arguments, typically including an introduction, main points with supporting evidence, and a conclusion.\n3. Evidence: Back up your claims with relevant facts, statistics, expert opinions, and real-world examples. Be prepared to cite sources if asked.\n4. Logical reasoning: Employ sound logic and avoid fallacies. Construct valid arguments and identify weaknesses in opposing arguments.\n5. Rebuttal: Listen carefully to opposing arguments and provide strong counterarguments. Address the key points raised by the other side.\n6. Persuasive techniques: Use rhetorical devices, emotional appeals, and compelling language to enhance your arguments, but maintain ethical standards.\n7. Time management: Be concise and respect time limits. Prioritize your strongest points if time is limited.\n8. Etiquette: Maintain a respectful tone. Attack ideas, not people. \n9. Adaptability: Be prepared to think on your feet and adjust your strategy based on the flow of the debate.\n10. Closing: Summarize your key points and reaffirm your position in your concluding remarks.\n\n## Debate Format:\n1. Two debaters or teams present arguments for and against a motion.\n2. There are three stages:\n  * Opening statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Rebuttal statements (4 minutes, around 520 words)\n  * Closing statements (2 minutes, around 260 words)\n3. Speaking order for each stage: FOR side speaks first, followed by AGAINST\n4. Victory determination:\n  * Audience votes before debate (initial position)\n  * Audience votes after debate (final position)\n  * Winner: Side that achieves the largest shift in audience support\n  * Example: If FOR moves from 30% to 45% (+15%) and AGAINST from 70% to 55% (-15%), FOR wins\n\nRemember, your goal is to present the most compelling case for your assigned position. Await the specific debate topic and your assigned stance before beginning.\n\n## Knowledge\n### Constructive Arguments:\n- A strong constructive argument defines all key terms within the motion, establishing the boundaries for the debate.\n- It presents a clear judging standard (framework) that clarifies how your arguments support your stance.\n- It includes well-structured arguments (contentions) that support your stance. These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values. Instead, derive values directly from the motion and your team's stance, potentially delving into the essence of the social issue at hand. Connect these values back to the motion and your stance, using them to further substantiate your position.\n"

Patients save on average $223 per visit along with 4-6 hours (\"0_0\") by reducing travel and wait times, while Medicare could save an estimated $170 million by 2029 simply through reduced patient travel (\"0_1\"). Providers also experience significant cost reductions due to lower overhead associated with virtual consultations (\"0_5\"). This includes reduced spending on office space, supplies, and other traditional practice expenses. These savings allow for a more efficient allocation of resources, ultimately improving patient care and system efficiency.  Therefore, increased telemedicine adoption offers a financially advantageous approach to healthcare delivery.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine improves the management of chronic conditions.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'Benefits of telemedicine for chronic disease management', 'title': 'Telemedicine for Chronic Disease Management: Benefits, Challenges, and ...', 'url': 'https://www.epainassist.com/articles/chronic-disease-management'}, {'id': '3_6', 'query': 'Effectiveness of telemedicine in managing chronic conditions', 'title': 'Revolutionizing Healthcare: How Telemedicine Is Improving Patient ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11298029/'}, {'id': '3_16', 'query': 'Studies on telemedicine and chronic care management', 'title': 'Revolutionizing Healthcare: How Telemedicine Is Improving Patient ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11298029/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Numerous studies demonstrate telemedicine's positive impact on chronic disease management.  A systematic review highlighted telemedicine as \"transformative,\" especially for diabetes care, with notable improvements in patient health outcomes and cost savings.  Moreover, telehealth increases access to specialists for patients in remote areas, facilitating regular follow-ups crucial for chronic condition management.  Improved patient engagement through telehealth platforms further enhances this effect, leading to better overall management of chronic conditions.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '5_1', 'query': 'Telemedicine and reduction of hospital-acquired infections', 'title': 'Inpatient Telemedicine and New Models of Care during COVID-19: Hospital ...', 'url': 'https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/16/8391'}, {'id': '5_6', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on hospital-acquired infection rates', 'title': 'Inpatient Telemedicine and New Models of Care during COVID-19: Hospital ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8391330/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Multiple studies highlight telemedicine's role in infection control.  Research indicates telemedicine usage during the COVID-19 pandemic significantly contributed to the prevention of hospital-acquired infections (\"5_6\").  This demonstrates that minimizing physical presence in hospitals through remote consultations reduces the risk of exposure to pathogens, thereby decreasing infection rates.  Furthermore, research suggests telemedicine improves various aspects of patient safety, with infection prevention being a key benefit (\"5_1\"). This strengthens the argument for expanded telemedicine use as a strategy for infection control, improving overall healthcare safety.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 581 words for the opening statement.

        "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, today we stand firmly in support of the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. We believe that expanding access to this vital healthcare delivery method is not just beneficial, but essential for a healthier and more equitable future.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by telemedicine.  We define it as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using HIPAA-compliant telecommunications technology.  This includes video conferencing, remote monitoring, and secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers.  This is not about replacing in-person care entirely, but rather augmenting and expanding access to it.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will increasing the use of telemedicine demonstrably improve patient outcomes, expand healthcare access, and enhance the efficiency of our healthcare system?  We believe the evidence overwhelmingly supports a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nLet me turn to our first point: telemedicine reduces healthcare costs for patients and providers. Consider this: how much time and money do you spend traveling to doctor's appointments, sitting in waiting rooms, and taking time off work?  Studies in Patient Preference and Adherence show patients save on average $223 and 4-6 hours per visit using telemedicine [1]. Think about what you could do with that extra time and money. This is a real, tangible benefit for everyday people.  Moreover, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) reports that Medicare could save an estimated $170 million by 2029 through reduced patient travel alone [2].  For providers, E-soft Skills highlights the cost reductions achieved through lower overhead associated with virtual consultations [3]. This includes savings on office space, supplies, and other traditional practice expenses, allowing resources to be redirected towards improving patient care.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine dramatically improves the management of chronic conditions.  Imagine the difficulty of managing a chronic illness if you live miles from a specialist or struggle with mobility issues.  Telehealth offers a solution. EPAIN Assist emphasizes the transformative role of telemedicine in chronic disease management, particularly for conditions like diabetes [4].  Research in Patient Care Technology highlights improved access to specialists for remote patients, enabling vital follow-up care [5]. This constant connection to care leads to better management of these conditions. Improved patient engagement through telehealth platforms further enhances this effect.  Telemedicine empowers individuals to take control of their health, resulting in better outcomes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is patient safety, and that leads to our third argument: telemedicine reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute notes that telemedicine significantly contributed to preventing hospital-acquired infections during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. By reducing physical presence in hospitals, we limit exposure to pathogens.  As you'll see, this is a significant advantage in protecting vulnerable patients. Further research in Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute suggests that telemedicine improves various aspects of patient safety, with infection prevention being a key benefit [7].  This underscores the importance of telemedicine in creating a safer healthcare environment for all.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the use of telemedicine is not just a good idea, it's a necessary step towards a more accessible, affordable, and effective healthcare system. We urge you to support this motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Patel, S. Y., et al. (2022).

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nFriends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand in opposition to the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. While acknowledging its potential benefits, we argue that a rapid expansion of telemedicine without addressing crucial underlying issues will exacerbate existing healthcare disparities and create new challenges for underserved populations.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definition provided by the proponents. While we agree with their definition of telemedicine as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that \u201cHIPAA-compliant\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equate to equitable access.  This is a critical distinction that we will return to later.\n\nOur judging criteria for today should be: does expanding telemedicine truly improve healthcare equity and address the needs of all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable?  We contend that the current trajectory of telemedicine expansion fails to meet this vital criterion.\n\nLet me turn to our first point: increased telemedicine usage worsens existing healthcare disparities. Studies in PubMed reveal significant disparities in telemedicine access across different socioeconomic groups (1). Healthcare Disparities further underscores this, highlighting that underserved populations, often lacking devices, internet access, or digital literacy, are effectively excluded from the benefits of telemedicine (2).  This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, worsening existing health disparities. Expanding telemedicine without addressing these fundamental inequalities will only deepen the healthcare divide.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas. McKinsey & Company's research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (4). This concentration creates a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities. Physician Leaders' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities (3).  Consequently, telemedicine risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers and exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of professionals in underserved rural communities. While some might argue telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely, this fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, especially in emergencies.  Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\nFinally, let's address the digital divide. The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms (5). Furthermore, CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals (6, 7).  This creates a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not whether telemedicine holds potential, but whether its current implementation exacerbates existing inequalities. As you\u2019ll see, without addressing these fundamental issues of access, digital literacy, and equitable distribution of healthcare professionals, expanding telemedicine risks creating a system that further marginalizes the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Morales, D.

Franciosi et al.'s study (\"The Impact of Telehealth Implementation on Underserved Populations...\") demonstrates telemedicine's potential to expand healthcare access by removing traditional barriers like transportation. While the opponent's argument correctly points to disparities in telemedicine access due to the digital divide (lack of devices, internet, digital literacy), this doesn't negate telemedicine's inherent ability to improve access.  This study, conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic across various medical specialties, underscores telemedicine's potential. Moreover, addressing the digital divide through initiatives like broadband expansion and digital literacy training can further enhance access, transforming telemedicine into a powerful tool for health equity.  The focus should be on bridging the digital divide and ensuring equitable access to telemedicine, rather than abandoning a technology with the potential to significantly improve healthcare for underserved populations. Ignoring telemedicine's potential based on existing disparities would be akin to rejecting public transportation due to unequal car ownership\u2014the solution lies in addressing the disparity, not discarding the potentially beneficial tool.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"We should increase the use of telemedicine, defined as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of HIPAA-compliant telecommunications technology, by incentivizing healthcare providers to offer telehealth services through adjusted reimbursement rates and expanding broadband access in underserved communities, with the goal of improving healthcare access for rural populations, chronically ill individuals, and those with mobility limitations, and measuring success through metrics like patient satisfaction, healthcare utilization rates, and cost-effectiveness.\", \"argument\": [\"We should increase the use of telemedicine, defined as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of HIPAA-compliant telecommunications technology, by incentivizing healthcare providers to offer telehealth services through adjusted reimbursement rates and expanding broadband access in underserved communities, with the goal of improving healthcare access for rural populations, chronically ill individuals, and those with mobility limitations, and measuring success through metrics like patient satisfaction, healthcare utilization rates, and cost-effectiveness.\", \"Expands healthcare access for rural populations, chronically ill individuals, and those with mobility limitations.\", \"Improves healthcare access by incentivizing telehealth services through adjusted reimbursement rates and expanding broadband access.\", \"Measures success through patient satisfaction, healthcare utilization rates, and cost-effectiveness.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"McKinsey & Company\\'s research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers.\\\\\", \\\\\"This concentration creates a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.\\\\\", \\\\\"Physician Leaders\\' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers and exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of professionals in underserved rural communities.\\\\\", \\\\\"Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"The current implementation of telemedicine exacerbates existing inequalities.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals.\\\\\", \\\\\"This creates a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"Without addressing these fundamental issues of access, digital literacy, and equitable distribution of healthcare professionals, expanding telemedicine risks creating a system that further marginalizes the most vulnerable members of our society.\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_0', 'query': 'Benefits of telemedicine for chronic disease management', 'title': 'Telemedicine for Chronic Disease Management: Benefits, Challenges, and ...', 'url': 'https://www.epainassist.com/articles/chronic-disease-management'}, {'id': '3_3', 'query': 'Benefits of telemedicine for chronic disease management', 'title': 'Revolutionizing Healthcare: How Telemedicine Is Improving Patient ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11298029/'}, {'id': '0_0', 'query': 'Cost savings of telemedicine for patients', 'title': 'Patient satisfaction and cost savings analysis of the telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9651094/'}, {'id': '0_1', 'query': 'Cost savings of telemedicine for patients', 'title': 'Telehealth Effect on Total Cost of Care -

Studies demonstrate significant cost savings for patients due to reduced travel expenses and avoidance of unnecessary hospital visits (0_0, 0_1).  Moreover, telemedicine significantly improves chronic disease management through consistent monitoring and timely interventions, leading to better health outcomes (3_0, 3_3). These benefits are particularly impactful for rural communities with limited access to specialists (1_0, 1_1), chronically ill individuals requiring continuous care, and those with mobility limitations facing barriers to traditional in-person visits. While concerns exist about potential exacerbation of healthcare professional shortages, incentivizing providers through adjusted reimbursement rates and expanding broadband access can mitigate this risk and ensure equitable access. Addressing digital literacy concerns through targeted training programs can further enhance inclusivity. The high patient satisfaction reported in multiple studies (2_10, 2_11) strengthens the case for expanded telemedicine utilization.\n\n\n\n\n## Tips: \n1.

        "content": "Friends, judges, colleagues, let\u2019s address the concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that telemedicine exacerbates existing healthcare disparities.  However, this argument misrepresents the issue.  The Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows us that telemedicine itself doesn\u2019t create disparities; it merely highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources [1]. As you\u2019ll see, the solution is not to abandon telemedicine but to address the root causes of these disparities. Imagine a community with limited access to specialized care.  Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.  This is a powerful tool for equity. The Mental Health Journal confirms the efficacy of tele-psychiatry in expanding access to mental health services in underserved areas [2]. This demonstrates the potential of telemedicine to address critical healthcare needs in communities often overlooked by traditional healthcare systems. We must focus on bridging the digital divide through targeted investments in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy training. This allows everyone to benefit from telemedicine, transforming it into a powerful tool for health equity.\n\nThis brings me to the opposition's claim that telemedicine exacerbates healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.  While acknowledging the existing shortage, the HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists [3]. Imagine living in a rural community with limited access to specialized care. Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to you, regardless of location. We agree with our opponents that the focus should be on attracting and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas. However, telemedicine can be part of the solution.  By providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, we can make these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals and improve the quality of care. The opponents miss a key point: telemedicine isn't about replacing local healthcare providers; it's about supplementing and supporting them. It\u2019s about ensuring you have access to the right care at the right time, no matter where you live.\n\nFinally, the opponents claim that a lack of digital literacy hinders widespread telemedicine adoption. However, this is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine. Imagine navigating a complex healthcare system when you\u2019re unfamiliar with the technology. This can be intimidating and frustrating. However, targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms. The goal is to provide user-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs.  This ensures that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily access and benefit from telemedicine.  \n\nIn contrast, abandoning telemedicine would further disenfranchise those who could potentially benefit most.  Think about the cost savings for patients and the improved chronic disease management achieved through telemedicine. These benefits, supported by studies in journals like Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, are undeniable [4, 5].  The opposition\u2019s focus on the potential drawbacks of telemedicine without acknowledging its numerous benefits is a disservice to those who stand to gain the most from its expanded use. Remember, high patient satisfaction rates, as documented in multiple studies, underscore the positive impact of telemedicine [6, 7].\n\nTherefore, we must embrace the potential of telemedicine while proactively addressing the challenges of access and digital literacy. We urge you to support the motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Franciosi, J. P., et al. (2021).

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nFriends, judges, colleagues, the proponents argue that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities.  However, this argument ignores the crucial ways it actively exacerbates them. They cite the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, suggesting telemedicine doesn't create disparities.  However, UCLA Health research reveals that underserved populations, already facing barriers to in-person care like needing unpaid time off, are further disadvantaged by the technological requirements of telemedicine (1).  This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating a new barrier to access.  Consider this: you already struggle to get to a doctor's appointment due to work constraints.  Now, you also need reliable internet and a device, effectively doubling the hurdles you face.  This is not equitable healthcare. Furthermore, the proponents mention expanding access to mental health services. While laudable, ScienceDirect research validates that lower education and income correlate with lower digital literacy, meaning many can't effectively use tele-platforms even if provided (2). This isn\u2019t just highlighting a problem; it\u2019s widening the digital divide and creating new disparities.\n\nThe proponents' claim that telemedicine addresses healthcare worker shortages is equally flawed.  They cite the HHS, stating telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations. However, this shifts the burden, exacerbating burnout among urban providers without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Physician Leaders found a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3).  Imagine you're an urban physician already stretched thin. Now, you\u2019re expected to cover vast rural populations remotely, increasing your workload without addressing the root problem.  This is unsustainable. Telemedicine, in this context, isn\u2019t a solution; it\u2019s a band-aid that masks the deeper issue of unequal resource distribution. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscores this, showing pervasive digital literacy gaps that hinder telemedicine's efficacy in underserved populations (4).\n\nOur argument isn't against telemedicine's potential; it's against its current implementation.  Expanding telemedicine without addressing the digital divide and rural healthcare worker shortages will only worsen inequalities. They mention cost savings and improved chronic disease management, citing Patient Preference and Adherence and NCQA.  However, these benefits are inaccessible to those lacking devices, internet, or the skills to use them.  What\u2019s the point of cost savings if you can\u2019t even access the service? Imagine being chronically ill in a rural area, lacking a local specialist and struggling to use telemedicine due to low digital literacy.  Telemedicine, in this case, is not a solution. They highlight high patient satisfaction rates, but whose satisfaction are we measuring? Likely those who already have access and the skills to navigate the system. This ignores the marginalized, further entrenching existing inequalities.  \n\nThe proponents suggest targeted digital literacy programs can address this.  However, these programs are often underfunded and inaccessible to those who need them most.  Furthermore, simply providing technology doesn\u2019t magically erase the complex socioeconomic factors contributing to healthcare disparities. McKinsey & Company\u2019s research shows higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, further incentivizing provider relocation and worsening rural shortages (5). This isn't bridging the gap; it's widening it. Thus, increasing telemedicine usage without simultaneously addressing the underlying issues of access, digital literacy, and healthcare worker distribution will only deepen the healthcare divide. We urge you to oppose this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] https://www.uclahealth.org/news/release/making-telemedicine-more-accessible-to-vulnerable-underserved-populations\n\n[2] Van Deursen, A. J.

These arguments should be logically connected and each contain at least one of the following: data, theory, or examples. Each argument should link back to the judging standard.\n\n### Theories, Data, and Examples:\n- **Theory** refers to established principles or models developed by experts in relevant fields (e.g., scientists, sociologists) to explain observed phenomena.\n- **Data** refers to specific, quantifiable information obtained through research methods like surveys or statistical analysis.\n- **Examples** illustrate arguments through real-world instances, events, or narratives involving individuals or groups.\nUsing a combination of theories, data, and examples strengthens the persuasiveness of your arguments.\n\n### Definition Debate\n- A definition debate arises when both sides disagree on the core concept of the motion, vying for the right to define it. Definition forms the cornerstone of argumentation.\n- Common methods of contesting definitions:\n    - **Appeal to Authority:** Citing authoritative sources to substantiate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Common Sense (Context):** Utilizing relatable scenarios/examples to evoke common understanding and validate the definition.\n    - **Appeal to Absurdity:** Demonstrating that the opponent's definition is overly broad/unreasonable, rendering the motion self-evident and leaving no room for debate.\n    - **Appeal to Logic:** Employing counterexamples or logical reasoning to expose flaws in the opponent's definition and reinforce the validity of one's own definition (common rebuttal techniques outlined below can also be applied).\n\nCombining multiple methods of contesting definitions can yield more effective results.\n\n### Framework Debate\n- A framework debate arises when both sides disagree on the criteria for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to set the standard of judgment. The framework serves as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Common methods of contesting frameworks are similar to those used in definition debates.\n\n### Battleground\n\"Battleground\" is a debate term referring to the **core** issues contested by both sides. A battleground might involve:\n- Disputing the definition of a word or concept.\n- Contesting the criteria for judgment.\n- Debating the interpretation of data or theories.\n- Arguing over the meaning of values.\n\nThe team winning more battlegrounds generally wins the debate. Not every issue raised qualifies as a battleground. Identifying and analyzing these battlegrounds is crucial for determining the debate's trajectory and outcome.\n\n### Clash\n\"Clash\" refers to the direct confrontation of arguments and evidence within a **specific battleground**. The outcome of a clash determines which side wins that particular battleground.\n### Criteria Debate\n- A criteria debate arises when both sides disagree on the standards for evaluating the motion, vying for the right to establish these criteria. Criteria serve as the yardstick for assessing arguments.\n- Strategies for winning a criteria debate are similar to those used in definition debates\u220fo'p\n\n### Values\n- Incorporating a profound discussion of values can enhance your closing statement. However, remember that values should serve your **stance** and ultimately contribute to winning the debate. They must be grounded in well-developed arguments.\n- Avoid vague appeals to values.

        "content": "**Opponent's opening Statement**\nFriends, judges, esteemed colleagues, today we stand firmly in support of the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. We believe that expanding access to this vital healthcare delivery method is not just beneficial, but essential for a healthier and more equitable future.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s clarify what we mean by telemedicine.  We define it as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using HIPAA-compliant telecommunications technology.  This includes video conferencing, remote monitoring, and secure messaging between patients and healthcare providers.  This is not about replacing in-person care entirely, but rather augmenting and expanding access to it.\n\nOur judging criteria today is simple: will increasing the use of telemedicine demonstrably improve patient outcomes, expand healthcare access, and enhance the efficiency of our healthcare system?  We believe the evidence overwhelmingly supports a resounding \"yes.\"\n\nLet me turn to our first point: telemedicine reduces healthcare costs for patients and providers. Consider this: how much time and money do you spend traveling to doctor's appointments, sitting in waiting rooms, and taking time off work?  Studies in Patient Preference and Adherence show patients save on average $223 and 4-6 hours per visit using telemedicine [1]. Think about what you could do with that extra time and money. This is a real, tangible benefit for everyday people.  Moreover, the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) reports that Medicare could save an estimated $170 million by 2029 through reduced patient travel alone [2].  For providers, E-soft Skills highlights the cost reductions achieved through lower overhead associated with virtual consultations [3]. This includes savings on office space, supplies, and other traditional practice expenses, allowing resources to be redirected towards improving patient care.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine dramatically improves the management of chronic conditions.  Imagine the difficulty of managing a chronic illness if you live miles from a specialist or struggle with mobility issues.  Telehealth offers a solution. EPAIN Assist emphasizes the transformative role of telemedicine in chronic disease management, particularly for conditions like diabetes [4].  Research in Patient Care Technology highlights improved access to specialists for remote patients, enabling vital follow-up care [5]. This constant connection to care leads to better management of these conditions. Improved patient engagement through telehealth platforms further enhances this effect.  Telemedicine empowers individuals to take control of their health, resulting in better outcomes.\n\nThe crucial issue here is patient safety, and that leads to our third argument: telemedicine reduces the risk of hospital-acquired infections. Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute notes that telemedicine significantly contributed to preventing hospital-acquired infections during the COVID-19 pandemic [6]. By reducing physical presence in hospitals, we limit exposure to pathogens.  As you'll see, this is a significant advantage in protecting vulnerable patients. Further research in Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute suggests that telemedicine improves various aspects of patient safety, with infection prevention being a key benefit [7].  This underscores the importance of telemedicine in creating a safer healthcare environment for all.\n\nIn conclusion, increasing the use of telemedicine is not just a good idea, it's a necessary step towards a more accessible, affordable, and effective healthcare system. We urge you to support this motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Patel, S. Y., et al. (2022).

Present only the final text.\n\n## Definition of the motion\n\n\n## Plan\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Increased telemedicine usage worsens existing healthcare disparities for underserved populations.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_0', 'query': 'How does telemedicine access differ between various socioeconomic groups?', 'title': 'Racial and ethnic differences in telemedicine use among ... - PubMed', 'url': 'https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38838690/'}, {'id': '0_1', 'query': 'How does telemedicine access differ between various socioeconomic groups?', 'title': 'Healthcare Disparities in Telemedicine Access and Use During the COVID ...', 'url': 'https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1002/pra2.1178'}, {'id': '0_2', 'query': 'How does telemedicine access differ between various socioeconomic groups?', 'title': 'Racial and Socioeconomic Disparities in Access to Telehealth', 'url': 'https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8726710/'}]\n**Short Argument**: Studies show significant disparities in telemedicine access among different socioeconomic groups, particularly for underserved populations who often lack the necessary devices, internet access, or digital literacy skills (0_0, 0_1, 0_2).  This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, effectively excluding these vulnerable populations and worsening existing health disparities. Therefore, increasing telemedicine usage without addressing these underlying issues will exacerbate inequalities in healthcare delivery.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas by concentrating providers in urban centers.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_1', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on healthcare professional shortages in underserved areas', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_19', 'query': 'How does telemedicine affect the distribution of healthcare providers?', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_22', 'query': 'Concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas', 'title': 'Mapping virtual care - McKinsey & Company', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/charts/mapping-virtual-care'}, {'id': '3_25', 'query': 'How can the concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas exacerbate healthcare worker shortages in rural areas?', 'title': 'Bridging the Rural-Urban Healthcare Gap with Telemedicine', 'url': 'https://magazine.doctorsexplain.net/bridging-rural-urban-healthcare-gap-telemedicine'}]\n**Long Argument**: While telemedicine presents opportunities for expanding care, it's crucial to consider its potential to exacerbate healthcare worker shortages, particularly in underserved rural areas. McKinsey & Company's research reveals significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (3_22). This disparity creates a powerful incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the greater availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.  This migration further depletes the already limited pool of healthcare workers in rural areas (3_1), which face significant challenges in attracting and retaining qualified professionals. The 2023 study by Physician Leaders underscores the severity of this issue, revealing a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3_1).  Consequently, telemedicine, if not implemented strategically, risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers while exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved rural communities. One might argue that telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely. However, this approach fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, particularly in emergencies, and may not be culturally appropriate for all patients.  Moreover, relying on urban providers to serve rural populations via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\n### Action: Propose New Claim\n**Our Claims to be proposed**: Telemedicine can create a digital divide in healthcare, exacerbating disparities between those with access to technology and those without.\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '8_5', 'query': 'Digital divide in healthcare and telemedicine', 'title': \"The Digital Divide in Healthcare: It's Not Just Access\", 'url': 'https://gkc.himss.org/resources/digital-divide-healthcare-its-not-just-access'}, {'id': '8_21', 'query': 'Telemedicine access barriers for low-income individuals', 'title': \"Telehealth's Impact on Health Equity: Evidence Roundup\", 'url': 'https://www.chcs.org/resource/telehealths-impact-on-health-equity-evidence-roundup/'}, {'id': '8_22', 'query': 'Telemedicine access barriers for low-income individuals', 'title': 'Telemedicine Health Disparities in the Black Community', 'url': 'https://telehealth.org/telemedicine-health-disparities-in-the-black-community/'}]\n**Medium Argument**: The increased use of telemedicine, while potentially beneficial, exacerbates existing health disparities.  Studies show that despite owning smartphones, many underserved populations face a \"digital divide\" due to lack of digital literacy and ill-suited digital health solutions (\"8_5\").  Additionally, access to reliable technology and internet remains a significant barrier for low-income individuals (\"8_21\", \"8_22\"). These combined factors create a two-tiered system, where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized in accessing healthcare via telemedicine. This results in a digital divide, hindering access to vital medical services.\n\n\n\n## Format\nThe output MUST contain 497 words for the opening statement.

        "content": "Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand in opposition to the motion: We should increase the use of telemedicine. While acknowledging its potential benefits, we argue that a rapid expansion of telemedicine without addressing crucial underlying issues will exacerbate existing healthcare disparities and create new challenges for underserved populations.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s address the definition provided by the proponents. While we agree with their definition of telemedicine as the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients using technology, it\u2019s crucial to acknowledge that \u201cHIPAA-compliant\u201d doesn\u2019t automatically equate to equitable access.  This is a critical distinction that we will return to later.\n\nOur judging criteria for today should be: does expanding telemedicine truly improve healthcare equity and address the needs of all members of our society, particularly the most vulnerable?  We contend that the current trajectory of telemedicine expansion fails to meet this vital criterion.\n\nLet me turn to our first point: increased telemedicine usage worsens existing healthcare disparities. Studies in PubMed reveal significant disparities in telemedicine access across different socioeconomic groups (1). Healthcare Disparities further underscores this, highlighting that underserved populations, often lacking devices, internet access, or digital literacy, are effectively excluded from the benefits of telemedicine (2).  This digital divide creates a barrier to healthcare access, worsening existing health disparities. Expanding telemedicine without addressing these fundamental inequalities will only deepen the healthcare divide.\n\nThis brings me to our second argument: telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas. McKinsey & Company's research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers (4). This concentration creates a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities. Physician Leaders' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities (3).  Consequently, telemedicine risks deepening the healthcare divide, concentrating resources in urban centers and exacerbating the pre-existing shortage of professionals in underserved rural communities. While some might argue telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural patients remotely, this fails to address the fundamental need for on-the-ground care, especially in emergencies.  Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in these underserved regions.\n\nFinally, let's address the digital divide. The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms (5). Furthermore, CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals (6, 7).  This creates a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\n\nThe crucial issue here is not whether telemedicine holds potential, but whether its current implementation exacerbates existing inequalities. As you\u2019ll see, without addressing these fundamental issues of access, digital literacy, and equitable distribution of healthcare professionals, expanding telemedicine risks creating a system that further marginalizes the most vulnerable members of our society.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Morales, D.

        "content": "**Opponent's rebuttal Statement**\nFriends, judges, colleagues, let\u2019s address the concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that telemedicine exacerbates existing healthcare disparities.  However, this argument misrepresents the issue.  The Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows us that telemedicine itself doesn\u2019t create disparities; it merely highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources [1]. As you\u2019ll see, the solution is not to abandon telemedicine but to address the root causes of these disparities. Imagine a community with limited access to specialized care.  Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.  This is a powerful tool for equity. The Mental Health Journal confirms the efficacy of tele-psychiatry in expanding access to mental health services in underserved areas [2]. This demonstrates the potential of telemedicine to address critical healthcare needs in communities often overlooked by traditional healthcare systems. We must focus on bridging the digital divide through targeted investments in broadband infrastructure and digital literacy training. This allows everyone to benefit from telemedicine, transforming it into a powerful tool for health equity.\n\nThis brings me to the opposition's claim that telemedicine exacerbates healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.  While acknowledging the existing shortage, the HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists [3]. Imagine living in a rural community with limited access to specialized care. Telemedicine bridges that gap, bringing specialists directly to you, regardless of location. We agree with our opponents that the focus should be on attracting and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas. However, telemedicine can be part of the solution.  By providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, we can make these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals and improve the quality of care. The opponents miss a key point: telemedicine isn't about replacing local healthcare providers; it's about supplementing and supporting them. It\u2019s about ensuring you have access to the right care at the right time, no matter where you live.\n\nFinally, the opponents claim that a lack of digital literacy hinders widespread telemedicine adoption. However, this is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine. Imagine navigating a complex healthcare system when you\u2019re unfamiliar with the technology. This can be intimidating and frustrating. However, targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms. The goal is to provide user-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs.  This ensures that even those unfamiliar with technology can easily access and benefit from telemedicine.  \n\nIn contrast, abandoning telemedicine would further disenfranchise those who could potentially benefit most.  Think about the cost savings for patients and the improved chronic disease management achieved through telemedicine. These benefits, supported by studies in journals like Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance, are undeniable [4, 5].  The opposition\u2019s focus on the potential drawbacks of telemedicine without acknowledging its numerous benefits is a disservice to those who stand to gain the most from its expanded use. Remember, high patient satisfaction rates, as documented in multiple studies, underscore the positive impact of telemedicine [6, 7].\n\nTherefore, we must embrace the potential of telemedicine while proactively addressing the challenges of access and digital literacy. We urge you to support the motion.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n[1] Franciosi, J. P., et al. (2021).

Firstly, the UCLA study on making telemedicine accessible underscores that underserved populations, who already face significant barriers to in-person care due to factors like needing unpaid time off work, are further disadvantaged by lacking reliable technology access needed for telemedicine. This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating an additional barrier by adding a technological layer to the already existing socioeconomic ones. Secondly, even when addressing cost, as some studies suggest telemedicine can do, the issue of digital literacy remains. A study in ScienceDirect validates that demographics such as lower education and income levels correlate with lower digital literacy. Thus, even if technology were provided, the skills to effectively navigate these platforms would still be lacking, thereby limiting the potential benefits of telemedicine for these populations and ultimately widening the digital divide. Addressing these critical gaps is paramount for true equitable healthcare.\n\n\n### Action: Attack Claim\n**Opponent's Claims to be attacked**: ['{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can address healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.\", \"argument\": [\"HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists\", \"Telemedicine bridges the gap in rural communities with limited access to specialized care.\", \"Telemedicine can be part of the solution by providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, making these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals\", \"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\", \"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\", \"Cost savings for patients and improved chronic disease management (Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance)\", \"High patient satisfaction rates documented in multiple studies\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '0_15', 'query': 'What are the digital literacy rates among different demographic groups, particularly those considered underserved?', 'title': 'Validated digital literacy measures for populations with low levels of ...', 'url': 'https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352728523000015'}, {'id': '0_16', 'query': 'What are the digital literacy rates among different demographic groups, particularly those considered underserved?', 'title': \"The Digital Inclusion Outlook: What It Looks Like and Where It's ...\", 'url': 'https://itif.org/publications/2023/05/01/the-digital-inclusion-outlook-what-it-looks-like-and-where-its-lacking/'}, {'id': '3_1', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on healthcare professional shortages in underserved areas', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_11', 'query': 'Does telemedicine worsen the healthcare provider shortage in rural areas?', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}]\n**Medium Argument**: Telemedicine doesn't solve rural healthcare worker shortages; it shifts the burden to already-strained urban providers (3_1).  Evidence shows rural areas lack specialists (3_1, 3_11) and telemedicine relies on existing urban providers expanding their reach, leading to increased workload and potential burnout without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Furthermore, digital literacy disparities exacerbate the issue, with underserved populations facing challenges accessing telemedicine, hindering its effectiveness (0_15, 0_16). Thus, telemedicine merely redistributes, not resolves, the shortage.\n\n\n### Action: Defend Claim\n**Our Claims to be defended**: ['{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas by concentrating providers in urban centers.\", \"argument\": [\"McKinsey & Company\\'s research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, creating a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.\", \"Physician Leaders\\' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities and the risk of telemedicine deepening the healthcare divide by concentrating resources in urban centers.\", \"Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in underserved regions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine can address healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap in rural communities with limited access to specialized care.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine can be part of the solution by providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, making these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals\\\\\", \\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"Cost savings for patients and improved chronic disease management (Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance)\\\\\", \\\\\"High patient satisfaction rates documented in multiple studies\\\\\"]}\"]}']\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_1', 'query': 'Impact of telemedicine on healthcare professional shortages in underserved areas', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_22', 'query': 'Concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas', 'title': 'Mapping virtual care - McKinsey & Company', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/charts/mapping-virtual-care'}]\n\n**Short Argument**: Telemedicine's increased adoption in urban centers creates a powerful draw for healthcare providers, exacerbating shortages in underserved areas.  McKinsey & Company found higher urban adoption rates (3_22), creating an incentive for relocation and leaving rural areas even more underserved.  This worsens existing shortages, as highlighted by the 2023 Physician Leaders study finding a 65% primary care physician deficit in rural areas (3_1).

Low-income individuals often lack reliable internet and devices, hindering their ability to utilize telemedicine.  Furthermore, many lack the digital literacy skills to navigate complex platforms (GKC HIMSS Resource).  This effectively excludes them from this mode of care, worsening existing disparities (CHCS, Telehealth.org).\n\n\n### Action: Defend Logic\n**Our Logic Chain to be defended**: [('{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can exacerbate the existing shortage of healthcare professionals in underserved areas by concentrating providers in urban centers.\", \"argument\": [\"McKinsey & Company\\'s research indicates significantly higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, creating a strong incentive for healthcare professionals to relocate to urban areas, drawn by the increased availability of telemedicine infrastructure and opportunities.\", \"Physician Leaders\\' 2023 study reveals a staggering 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas, highlighting the vulnerability of these communities and the risk of telemedicine deepening the healthcare divide by concentrating resources in urban centers.\", \"Relying on urban providers via telemedicine can create an unsustainable dependency and hinder the development of local healthcare infrastructure in underserved regions.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine can address healthcare professional shortages, particularly in rural areas.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"HHS highlights how telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations, expanding access to specialists\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap in rural communities with limited access to specialized care.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine can be part of the solution by providing incentives for telehealth services and incorporating it into rural healthcare strategies, making these areas more attractive to healthcare professionals\\\\\", \\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"Cost savings for patients and improved chronic disease management (Patient Preference and Adherence and the National Committee for Quality Assurance)\\\\\", \\\\\"High patient satisfaction rates documented in multiple studies\\\\\"]}\"]}', '{\"claim\": \"Telemedicine can create a digital divide in healthcare, exacerbating disparities between those with access to technology and those without.\", \"argument\": [\"The GKC HIMSS Resource highlights that even those with smartphones often lack the digital literacy necessary to navigate complex digital health platforms.\", \"CHCS and Telehealth.org emphasize the barriers to reliable technology and internet access faced by low-income individuals, creating a two-tiered system where those lacking technological resources are further marginalized, unable to access vital medical services through telemedicine.\"], \"counter-argument\": [\"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Telemedicine does not create disparities; it highlights pre-existing inequalities in access to technology and resources.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare shows that telemedicine itself doesn\\'t create disparities\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine bridges the gap, bringing specialists directly to patients, regardless of their location.\\\\\", \\\\\"Telemedicine expands access to mental health services in underserved areas (Mental Health Journal)\\\\\"]}\", \"{\\\\\"claim\\\\\": \\\\\"Lack of digital literacy is a challenge to overcome, not a reason to abandon telemedicine.\\\\\", \\\\\"argument\\\\\": [\\\\\"Targeted digital literacy programs can empower individuals to confidently access and utilize telemedicine platforms.\\\\\", \\\\\"User-friendly platforms and comprehensive digital literacy training programs can ensure that even those unfamiliar with technology can access and benefit from telemedicine.\\\\\"]}\"]}')]\n**Evidence**: [{'id': '3_11', 'query': 'Does telemedicine worsen the healthcare provider shortage in rural areas?', 'title': 'In the face of persistent healthcare workforce shortages, telemedicine ...', 'url': 'https://www.physicianleaders.org/articles/doi/10.55834/halmj.7234271190'}, {'id': '3_22', 'query': 'Concentration of telemedicine providers in urban areas', 'title': 'Mapping virtual care - McKinsey & Company', 'url': 'https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/sustainable-inclusive-growth/charts/mapping-virtual-care'}]\n**Short Argument**: Telemedicine exacerbates healthcare disparities.

        "content": "Friends, judges, colleagues, the proponents argue that telemedicine merely highlights existing disparities.  However, this argument ignores the crucial ways it actively exacerbates them. They cite the Journal of Telemedicine and Telecare, suggesting telemedicine doesn't create disparities.  However, UCLA Health research reveals that underserved populations, already facing barriers to in-person care like needing unpaid time off, are further disadvantaged by the technological requirements of telemedicine (1).  This isn't merely highlighting a disparity; it's creating a new barrier to access.  Consider this: you already struggle to get to a doctor's appointment due to work constraints.  Now, you also need reliable internet and a device, effectively doubling the hurdles you face.  This is not equitable healthcare. Furthermore, the proponents mention expanding access to mental health services. While laudable, ScienceDirect research validates that lower education and income correlate with lower digital literacy, meaning many can't effectively use tele-platforms even if provided (2). This isn\u2019t just highlighting a problem; it\u2019s widening the digital divide and creating new disparities.\n\nThe proponents' claim that telemedicine addresses healthcare worker shortages is equally flawed.  They cite the HHS, stating telemedicine allows urban providers to serve rural populations. However, this shifts the burden, exacerbating burnout among urban providers without attracting new professionals to rural areas. Physician Leaders found a 65% primary care physician shortage in rural areas (3).  Imagine you're an urban physician already stretched thin. Now, you\u2019re expected to cover vast rural populations remotely, increasing your workload without addressing the root problem.  This is unsustainable. Telemedicine, in this context, isn\u2019t a solution; it\u2019s a band-aid that masks the deeper issue of unequal resource distribution. The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation underscores this, showing pervasive digital literacy gaps that hinder telemedicine's efficacy in underserved populations (4).\n\nOur argument isn't against telemedicine's potential; it's against its current implementation.  Expanding telemedicine without addressing the digital divide and rural healthcare worker shortages will only worsen inequalities. They mention cost savings and improved chronic disease management, citing Patient Preference and Adherence and NCQA.  However, these benefits are inaccessible to those lacking devices, internet, or the skills to use them.  What\u2019s the point of cost savings if you can\u2019t even access the service? Imagine being chronically ill in a rural area, lacking a local specialist and struggling to use telemedicine due to low digital literacy.  Telemedicine, in this case, is not a solution. They highlight high patient satisfaction rates, but whose satisfaction are we measuring? Likely those who already have access and the skills to navigate the system. This ignores the marginalized, further entrenching existing inequalities.  \n\nThe proponents suggest targeted digital literacy programs can address this.  However, these programs are often underfunded and inaccessible to those who need them most.  Furthermore, simply providing technology doesn\u2019t magically erase the complex socioeconomic factors contributing to healthcare disparities. McKinsey & Company\u2019s research shows higher telemedicine adoption rates in urban centers, further incentivizing provider relocation and worsening rural shortages (5). This isn't bridging the gap; it's widening it. Thus, increasing telemedicine usage without simultaneously addressing the underlying issues of access, digital literacy, and healthcare worker distribution will only deepen the healthcare divide.

We firmly believe it does.  The opposition focuses on the digital divide and healthcare worker shortages, arguing that telemedicine exacerbates these issues. However, we\u2019ve demonstrated that these are pre-existing systemic problems, not inherent flaws of telemedicine.  Their argument is like blaming a bus for traffic congestion \u2013 the problem isn\u2019t the bus, it\u2019s the lack of adequate infrastructure.  We\u2019ve shown how addressing these root causes through broadband expansion, digital literacy programs, and provider incentives can transform telemedicine into a powerful tool for equity. Imagine a future where access to specialized care isn\u2019t limited by location, where managing a chronic illness is made easier through remote monitoring, and where the risk of hospital-acquired infections is significantly reduced. This is the future telemedicine offers.\n\nOur opponents highlight the difficulties faced by those lacking resources or digital literacy.  However, they fail to offer a viable alternative. Abandoning telemedicine won\u2019t magically solve these problems; it will only further isolate those who could benefit most.  We\u2019ve presented evidence demonstrating telemedicine\u2019s cost-saving benefits for patients and providers, its effectiveness in managing chronic conditions, and its crucial role in reducing hospital-acquired infections. These are real, tangible benefits supported by robust research. While acknowledging the need for further development, we\u2019ve shown how telemedicine offers a significant step towards a more equitable, accessible, and efficient healthcare system. We urge you to support a healthier future \u2013 support the motion to increase the use of telemedicine.\n\n\n**Reference**\n\n\n"

The proponents frame the digital divide and healthcare worker shortages as pre-existing issues.  However, we\u2019ve demonstrated how expanding telemedicine without addressing these issues exacerbates inequalities.  They compare telemedicine to a bus in traffic. We argue it's more like adding a luxury express bus route while neglecting existing public transportation in underserved areas. This doesn't solve the underlying transportation problem; it creates a two-tiered system, leaving some behind.\n\nOur opponents claim we lack alternatives.  Our alternative is simple: prioritize addressing the root causes of healthcare disparities before rapidly expanding technologies that exacerbate them.  Invest in broadband access, digital literacy training, and, crucially, recruit and retain healthcare workers in underserved communities.  Only then can telemedicine become a tool for true equity.  They highlight telemedicine\u2019s cost-saving potential and role in managing chronic conditions.  But imagine you're a low-income individual struggling with a chronic illness, lacking internet access or the digital skills to navigate a telemedicine platform.  These touted benefits remain out of reach, worsening existing inequalities.\n\nThe proponents\u2019 vision of a future with accessible specialized care is laudable.  However, their roadmap focuses on expanding technology while neglecting the human infrastructure needed to ensure equitable access.  McKinsey's research on urban telemedicine adoption and the Physician Leaders\u2019 study on rural physician shortages underscore our point: telemedicine, as currently implemented, exacerbates existing inequalities (1, 2).  Therefore, we urge you to oppose this motion.
