      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue against the notion that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. We define **dating expenses** as costs incurred during courtship activities, including but not limited to meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts. We define **equally shared** as dividing dating expenses in a strict 50/50 split, regardless of individual income or financial circumstances.\n\nOur judging criteria is **fairness and relationship health.** A dating expense arrangement is preferable if it fosters a sense of fairness, promotes healthy communication, and minimizes the potential for resentment and financial strain within the relationship.\n\nFirst, **equal splitting ignores income disparity, leading to financial strain and inequity.** A strict 50/50 split disproportionately burdens the lower-income partner, potentially creating financial hardship and resentment. It fails to account for differing financial realities. For instance, if one partner earns significantly less, say $30,000 annually, while the other earns $70,000, an equal split of a $100 dinner places a far greater burden on the lower-income individual. A CNBC report highlights that 37% of individuals feel their relationship is financially unequal [1]. This feeling of inequity can erode the relationship over time. Instead of promoting equality, it exacerbates existing financial inequalities outside the relationship, importing them directly into the dating dynamic.\n\nSecond, **equal splitting can be impractical and logistically complex.** Tracking every expense and ensuring a precise 50/50 split can be cumbersome, leading to unnecessary stress and conflict. It prioritizes accounting over the enjoyment of the date. As one person described to Buzzfeed, the downside of splitting everything was \"the illusion of him paying me when he was really just paying me back for his half...This sometimes led to being unsure how much he owed me for bills I already paid\" [2]. This constant tracking can transform a romantic outing into a bookkeeping exercise, hindering spontaneity and genuine connection. The focus shifts from enjoying each other's company to meticulously calculating who owes what, creating an environment ripe for disagreements and resentment.\n\nThird, **alternative approaches to sharing expenses foster stronger relationships through open communication and consideration.** Flexible approaches, such as income-based contributions, alternating payments, or shared expense accounts, promote open communication about finances and demonstrate consideration for each partner's circumstances, leading to a more equitable and fulfilling dynamic. For example, couples could calculate each partner's income percentage and apply that to shared expenses. If one partner earns 60% of the combined income, they cover 60% of the expenses [3]. Therapist Elisabeth LaMotte advocates for candid communication, advising couples to \"Have an honest conversation about money values early in the relationship,\" as transparency reduces anxiety [4]. This proactive approach fosters mutual respect and understanding, strengthening the relationship's foundation.\n\nIn conclusion, we oppose the motion that dating expenses should be shared equally. Equal splitting ignores income disparities, introduces logistical complexities, and undermines the potential for open communication. We advocate for flexible, considerate approaches that prioritize fairness, healthy communication, and the overall well-being of the relationship.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Long, N. (2023, August 15).

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their mischaracterization of our definition, their misunderstanding of the relationship between financial contributions and equality, their downplaying of the importance of financial equity in dating, and their misconstrual of potential power dynamics. By addressing these flaws, we will demonstrate how our model fosters more equitable relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to portray our definition of \"shared equally\" as a rigid, inflexible 50/50 split, ignoring the nuances of modern relationships; however, we never claimed it was an inflexible mandate. Our definition aims for a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a baseline for equitable contribution. This is not a rigid mandate, but rather a commitment to equality, acknowledging that open communication and mutual agreement can lead to adjustments based on individual circumstances. It's about the *intention* of equality, not necessarily rigid adherence to the number. This promotes equity while providing structure that their vague, \"flexible\" approach lacks. Their approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes. Therefore, maintaining our definition strengthens the basis of our equitable relationship.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships, citing a study that 56% of couples argue about money [1]. However, it's a straw man fallacy to say that we believe it *automatically* translates to these things. We argue that it *fosters* these positive outcomes. Furthermore, all disagreements are bad for relationships. Even if couples disagree about money, that doesn't mean it's worse than other topics to disagree on. In fact, regularly discussing shared expenses helps to foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. This aligns with the finding that couples who have similar spending habits, savings goals, and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship [6]. Thus, our model encourages healthier communication patterns compared to the opposition's, which lacks a proactive approach to financial discussions.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a strictly equal split disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment, citing Tu (2023). However, *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment if not discussed openly and agreed upon. That\u2019s why our definition allows for adjustments as long as both parties are communicating. It is crucial to ensure financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. The negative's \"flexible\" approach lacks structure and is *more* prone to inequity without a baseline to work from. Ultimately, open communication and a commitment to finding a fair balance are essential for a healthy relationship [4]. This focus on open communication about the intention of equal independence makes our argument stronger than the status quo.\n\nFinally, the negative argues that the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances, citing K\u00f6rner and Sch\u00fctz (2021). However, our model is meant to prevent this! The *intention* of the 50/50 split is to *address* potential power imbalances, not mask them. By having open conversations about finances, couples are more likely to identify and address underlying issues. In relationships, when couples contribute, this allows them to focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about one person footing the bill all the time and the dynamic that creates in your relationship [7]. By encouraging financial transparency,\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n(2) Tu.

      "stage": "rebuttal",
      "side": "against",
      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal contains several critical flaws: their shifting definition of \"shared equally,\" their oversimplified view of financial contributions, their neglect of individual financial capacities, and their misunderstanding of power dynamics within relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to defend their definition of \"shared equally,\" but in doing so, they have contradicted themselves [1]. They initially defined it as a strict 50/50 split but now claim it's merely a \"goal\" with room for adjustments. Which is it? This equivocation weakens their entire argument. If it's a strict 50/50 split, it's demonstrably unfair to couples with significant income disparities or differing financial obligations. If it's just a \"goal,\" then it provides no practical guidance and is essentially meaningless [2]. In fact, a strict 50/50 split can lead to significant issues, whereas flexible arrangements promote better communication. Therefore, their shifting definition undermines the very foundation of their case.\n\nSecond, while the affirmative claims that equal splitting \"fosters\" positive outcomes like better communication, they fail to prove that it's the *cause*, not merely a correlation [3]. Couples who are already good at communicating are naturally more likely to find a way to split expenses amicably, whether that's 50/50 or some other arrangement. The reverse is not necessarily true. Forcing a 50/50 split will not magically make a couple communicate better if they already have poor communication habits. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [4]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication. A flexible approach centered on open communication is far more likely to foster these positive outcomes, regardless of how the expenses are ultimately divided [5].\n\nThird, the affirmative dismisses our concerns about individual financial capacities by saying that *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment. While true, that doesn't negate the fact that a strict 50/50 split is *especially* problematic when income disparities are significant [6]. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [7]. We aren't arguing that flexible arrangements are perfect, but they are far more adaptable to individual circumstances, promoting true equity rather than a superficial equality.\n\nFinally, the affirmative claims their model aims to *prevent* power imbalances. However, the pressure to spend equally can itself *create* a power imbalance, particularly if one partner feels obligated to contribute more than they can comfortably afford [8]. The pursuit of strict equality can inadvertently mask underlying issues and create a subtle form of control or dependence. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [9]. Therefore, a more nuanced approach that considers all forms of contribution \u2013 financial and non-financial \u2013 is essential for fostering truly balanced and equitable relationships.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around establishing equitable relationships through the sharing of dating expenses.\n\nThe core of the opposition's argument is that our proposal for a 50/50 split is too rigid. However, we propose a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a *framework* for initiating open and honest conversations about finances. It's a commitment to equality, acknowledging that adjustments can\u2014and should\u2014be made based on individual circumstances [1]. Their \"flexible\" approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes.\n\nThey also claim that focusing on a 50/50 split creates a \"facade of gender equality,\" neglecting non-monetary contributions. We agree those contributions are valuable! However, unlike financial contributions, those are subjective and harder to quantify. Without a clear financial baseline, these non-monetary contributions can be easily exploited, leading to real power imbalances [2].\n\nThe opposition argues that even when couples split expenses 50/50, they still argue about money. Again, we never claimed splitting 50/50 *eliminates* disagreements! But it *fosters* healthier communication by providing a structure for discussing finances openly and regularly [3]. It encourages a *proactive* approach to financial discussions.\n\nUltimately, our model isn't about rigid numbers; it's about fairness, respect, and autonomy. We believe our side provides the fairest approach because it promotes equal contribution and reduces the potential for one partner to be financially burdened or taken advantage of [4].\n\nTherefore, we urge you to affirm: dating expenses *should* be shared equally, as a framework for an equitable relationship.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

      "stage": "closing",

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the best approach to achieve equity in dating expenses, a pursuit we all agree is important.\n\nOur opponents insist that a 50/50 split fosters equitable relationships; however, even framed as a \"goal\" [1], this approach creates pressure. This emphasis establishes an expectation, potentially leading to awkward and biased conversations, especially early in the relationship. Where is the open communication if there is a preconceived expectation? Their framework lacks the necessary flexibility and real-world applicability that modern relationships require.\n\nMoreover, while the opposition claims equal sharing fosters gender equality and open communication, simply splitting the bill doesn't eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication. Studies show that even when couples split expenses equally, financial disagreements persist [2]. True equality goes beyond finances. Are we devaluing emotional support, household contributions, or career sacrifices by prioritizing a strict financial split? It's a false equivalency to assume financial contributions alone guarantee an equitable partnership.\n\nFurthermore, mandating a 50/50 split disregards individual financial capacities. How can we ignore the inherent power imbalance when one partner earns significantly less? Even with open communication, the lower-income partner may feel pressured, leading to resentment or financial strain. As Tu explains, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities [3].\n\nFinally, while financial transparency is important, it doesn't automatically solve power imbalances. The intention of addressing power imbalances does not necessarily equate to a solid outcome. The emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying issues.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.
