      "content": "Today, we're here to discuss whether dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's define what we mean. \"Dating expenses\" includes all costs associated with dates, from meals and activities to transportation and entertainment. \"Equal sharing\" means each partner contributes roughly the same amount, whether by splitting each expense or alternating who pays.\n\nFor this debate, we propose that the most important factor to consider is which approach best supports equitable and healthy relationships. We believe the most beneficial approach is the one that fosters mutual respect, open communication, and balanced power dynamics.\n\nNow, let's explore why sharing dating expenses equally achieves these goals. First and foremost, equal sharing actively promotes gender equality by challenging outdated traditional dating scripts. For generations, society has placed the financial burden of dating primarily on men. As *Edwige International* pointed out in *2025*, this expectation reinforces outdated gender roles and can create significant financial pressure, especially with rising inflation and living costs. By sharing expenses equally, we actively challenge these norms, fostering a more equitable and respectful dynamic right from the start. This redefines expectations, allowing both partners to feel equally valued and empowered, rather than constrained by traditional roles.\n\nSecondly, equal contribution significantly reduces the potential for power imbalances that can arise from financial disparities. Think about it: when one partner consistently pays more, it can inadvertently create a sense of obligation or even control. According to research by *Tichenor in 2021*, financial dominance can lead to control issues, where the higher-earning partner might make unilateral decisions, creating a parent-child dynamic rather than a partnership of equals. The partner contributing less may feel indebted or unable to freely express their preferences. Sharing expenses levels the playing field, promoting a sense of partnership and mutual respect where both individuals feel valued and empowered to voice their opinions on everything from date locations to activities.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, equal sharing normalizes open and honest conversations about financial values and expectations. This is absolutely crucial for long-term compatibility. Dating isn't just about romance; it's about finding a partner with whom you can build a future. As *Experian's research in 2025* highlights, financial issues have led to the end of relationships for more than a quarter of Americans. Just as a garden needs constant tending, relationships require continuous nurturing through open dialogue. Discussing expenses early on sets a precedent for addressing financial matters honestly and openly, which is essential for a successful long-term partnership. In fact, *Fidelity* reported that *84%* of couples who communicate well about finances say that money isn't their greatest relationship challenge.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. This approach promotes gender equality, reduces power imbalances, and fosters open communication, laying the foundation for healthier, more equitable, and ultimately more fulfilling relationships. By embracing equal sharing, we pave the way for stronger, more balanced partnerships built on mutual respect and understanding.\n***\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Study: The Financial Costs of Dating in 2024. *Gutsy Media*.\n[2] Men's Dating Struggles In 2025 | Edwige International. *Edwige International*.\n[3] The Impact of Financial Inequality on Intimacy in Relationships. *Choosing Therapy*. 2023.\n[4] 13 Practical Ways to Deal With Money Imbalance in Relationships. *WikiExpert*. 2024.\n[5] Love and Money: How Financial Transparency Can .... *Experian*. 2025.\n[6] The Ultimate Guide to Financial Planning for Couples | Johnson .... *Johnson Financial Group*."

      "content": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

      "content": "The opposition argues that a strictly equal approach is flawed, disregards individual financial capacities, undermines non-monetary contributions, and masks power imbalances. However, their arguments oversimplify the complexities of our approach. We are reinforcing our claims of promoting gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships by explaining how our proposal encourages flexibility and open communication, recognizing all forms of contribution, financial and non-financial, to create a truly balanced partnership.\n\nThey claim that a strictly equal approach to sharing dating expenses is flawed and can undermine equity. While a rigidly equal approach might seem flawed on the surface, our core principle is equity. It's about fairness, and it reinforces gender equality by challenging traditional gender roles. It's not about turning the relationship into a mere transaction. It's about establishing a shared sense of responsibility. Think of it this way: neglecting car maintenance to save money might seem smart in the short term, but it leads to long-term problems. Similarly, ignoring equity sets the stage for future imbalances and resentment.\n\nThe opposition also claims that our approach disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment. We absolutely recognize that financial situations vary. It's not about burdening someone, but about fostering open communication and finding a comfortable way for both partners to contribute. For example, imagine a single mom dating a businessperson. They might split smaller expenses while the businessperson covers larger ones. This promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. According to *PMC*, initiating financial discussions earlier in a relationship benefits the quality of financial communication between partners [1]. The point is equity, not identical spending.\n\nAnd what about non-monetary contributions? We agree that emotional support and household chores are valuable. However, financial contributions are also important. It's about creating a balanced partnership, acknowledging all forms of value. As one article points out, gender roles often dictate expectations in relationships, with men traditionally seen as breadwinners [2]. By challenging these roles through shared financial responsibility, we create a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nThe opposition further argues that equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances. We agree that equal spending doesn't automatically eliminate power imbalances, but it's a step towards greater transparency and fairness. The goal isn't to solve all relationship imbalances overnight. Think of it like constructing a building: you need a solid foundation before adding the aesthetics. Similarly, establishing financial transparency creates a basis for addressing deeper power dynamics.\n\nFinally, let's revisit why we champion equal sharing. It confronts gender stereotypes, fostering mutual respect. Discussing expenses establishes healthy financial communication. *Journal of Financial Therapy* indicates that early financial communication can predict future financial management and reduce conflict [3]. When you share expenses, you're sharing responsibility, not just splitting a bill; you cultivate trust. The goal isn't to solve all relationship imbalances, it is to create a culture of respect where partners feel empowered and valued.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Saxey M., LeBaron-Black A., Curran M.

      "content": "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents are attempting to build a house on a shaky foundation. The real question isn't whether fairness is a good thing, but whether a rigid 50/50 split of dating expenses actually gets us there. As I'll demonstrate, it falls short.\n\nFirst, let's examine their idea of \"shared equally.\" They suggest the 50/50 split is a flexible aim. However, their entire argument rests on achieving equality through strictly equal contributions. This very definition forces a potentially awkward and biased conversation about finances. This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion. It creates an implicit pressure, contradicting the intention of open and unbiased financial discussions.\n\nSecond, they argue that equal sharing promotes gender equality. Now, we never claimed that equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. However, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships. This provides only a facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we risk devaluing non-monetary contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership. For example, who is taking care of the house chores? Who is planning the dates? These are all contributions that should be valued.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. They assume that splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. But did you know that even when couples split expenses 50/50, a significant number still argue about money? In fact, *radcoaches, a financial coach and happy couple of over 10 years*, found that couples who focus heavily on equal financial contributions also tend to have other negative money habits that hurt the relationship. This statistic highlights that equal division is not a cure-all for financial disagreements. Transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As *Healthline* reports, emotional manipulation in relationships can take many forms, including financial control. This can manifest as pressuring a partner to spend beyond their means or using financial contributions as leverage in disagreements.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. As *Psychology Today* reported in their article \"Financial Strain and Relationship Health,\" financial strain can lead to increased depressive symptoms and less satisfaction in the relationship. Therefore, financial instability can lead to a vicious cycle that can take a toll on the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

      "content": "Esteemed judges, we have demonstrated how sharing dating expenses fosters equitable relationships. The central point of contention has been the definition of \"shared equally.\" Our opponents argue that our 50/50 split is inflexible, and they want you to believe that financial conversations will automatically lead to awkwardness. But that's simply not the case.\n\nWe've established that our 50/50 split is a baseline, a starting point for discussion. Without a baseline, how can true equity ever be achieved?\n\nWe've shown that our model, with its emphasis on open financial conversation, actually fosters healthier communication. It directly addresses financial stress and challenges outdated gender roles. The opposition's \"flexible\" approach lacks any real structure. How comfortable would *you* feel entering a relationship with absolutely no financial framework in place?\n\nOur model promotes financial transparency, which allows couples to identify and address potential power imbalances. The opposition claims that financial strain leads to depressive symptoms, but remember that the status quo places even more pressure on the person paying the entire bill.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the *intention* behind equal sharing. Our 50/50 split aims to *address* potential power imbalances head-on. We encourage financial transparency, empowering both partners to have open and honest conversations about money. The opposition's approach lacks this proactive element. They prioritize flexibility, which sounds appealing but lacks a solid foundation in reality. Therefore, we urge you to vote in favor of equal sharing, creating stronger, more equitable partnerships built on mutual respect and understanding."

We successfully refuted the opposition's claim that their approach fosters equitable relationships. We demonstrated that a rigid 50/50 split can undermine equity by disregarding individual circumstances. We successfully shifted the burden of proof, forcing them to defend a position that necessitates adjustments, thus moving away from their initial stance.\n\nThe opposition assumes financial equality equates to broader equity. But what about the partner forced into financial strain to maintain an artificial balance? We showed how their model devalues vital non-monetary contributions. Their reasoning fails to hold up under scrutiny when considering situations where non-monetary contributions and varying financial situations are dismissed. Their framework simply doesn't account for individual realities.\n\nWe demonstrated how their notion of \"equal\" contribution can pressure individuals, even creating new power dynamics. Remember, transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting. The crucial issue here is valuing all contributions, not just the financial ones.\n\nThe opposition's definition of \"shared equally\" is simply too simplistic. Their framework oversimplifies the big picture. Consider this: Should fairness truly be a pressure to split costs evenly, or a genuine and unbiased commitment?\n\nTrue equity considers individual circumstances. It values every contribution.

        "original_statement": "Today, we\u2019re debating whether dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. \"Dating expenses\" encompasses all costs incurred during dates, including meals, activities, transportation, and entertainment. \"Equal sharing\" means each partner contributes approximately the same amount, either splitting each expense or alternating who pays.\n\nOur judging criterion for this debate should center on which approach best fosters equitable and healthy relationship dynamics. We believe the most beneficial approach is the one that promotes mutual respect, open communication, and balanced power dynamics within the relationship.\n\nNow, let's examine why sharing dating expenses equally achieves this goal. Firstly, equal sharing promotes gender equality by challenging traditional dating scripts. For generations, societal norms have placed the financial burden of dating primarily on men. This expectation reinforces outdated gender roles and can create financial pressure. By sharing expenses equally, we actively challenge these norms, fostering a more equitable and respectful dynamic from the very beginning. Equal contribution redefines expectations.\n\nSecondly, equal contribution reduces the potential for power imbalances stemming from financial disparities. Consider this: when one partner consistently pays more, it can inadvertently create a sense of obligation or control. The partner contributing less may feel indebted or unable to express their preferences freely. Sharing expenses levels the playing field, promoting a sense of partnership and mutual respect where both individuals feel valued and empowered.\n\nFinally, equal sharing normalizes open and honest conversations about financial values and expectations. This is absolutely crucial for long-term compatibility. Dating is not just about romance; it\u2019s about finding a partner with whom you can build a future. Just as a garden needs constant tending, relationships require continuous nurturing through open dialogue. Discussing expenses early on sets a precedent for addressing financial matters honestly and openly, which is essential for a successful long-term partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that dating expenses should be shared equally. This approach promotes gender equality, reduces power imbalances, and fosters open communication, laying the foundation for healthier, more equitable, and ultimately more fulfilling relationships.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan**\n\nFor this debate on whether dating expenses should be shared equally, our opening statement will focus on establishing a clear definition, setting fair judging criteria, and presenting three core arguments in support of the motion. We will not address a definition from the opposing side, but rather put forth our own for consideration.\n\nFirst, we'll define \"dating expenses\" and \"equal sharing\" to set the boundaries of the debate. This will occupy approximately 50 words.\n\nSecond, we'll propose a judging criterion centered on promoting equitable and healthy relationship dynamics. The goal is to shift the focus from purely economic considerations to the broader impact on relationships. This section will take about 50 words.\n\nThird, we will present three key arguments, each developed in approximately 120 words.\n1.  Equal sharing promotes gender equality by challenging traditional dating scripts.\n2.  Equal contribution reduces power imbalances arising from financial disparities.\n3.  Equal sharing normalizes open conversations about financial values and expectations.\n\nIn presenting these arguments, we aim for clarity and conversational tone. We will use the analogy of tending a garden to reinforce the importance of proactive relationship maintenance through open financial communication. We will ensure our arguments are free of logical fallacies.\n\nFinally, our conclusion will summarize our main points and reiterate our support for the motion. This should take roughly 30 words.",
        "simulated_audience_feedback": [
          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The core message is clear: dating expenses should be shared equally to promote equitable and healthy relationships. The definitions of \"dating expenses\" and \"equal sharing\" are helpful for grounding the debate. The logical flow is also clear, presenting three main arguments: gender equality, reduced power imbalances, and normalized financial conversations. No technical terms are used.\n\nEngagement Impact: The examples and analogies are moderately effective. The reference to traditional dating scripts resonates with current discussions about gender roles. The analogy of a garden needing constant tending for the importance of open dialogue is a nice touch. However, the points could be made more memorable by incorporating more relatable anecdotes or scenarios that the audience can easily visualize.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The arguments are presented as logical reasons rather than empirical evidence. There's no data or statistics cited to support the claims. For example, the claim about financial pressure on men could be strengthened with statistics about spending habits or societal expectations. The arguments rely on theoretical benefits rather than concrete examples.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The argument appeals to the audience's sense of fairness and equality, which is likely to resonate. The practical relevance of discussing financial values is highlighted, which is important for long-term relationship success. The solutions are feasible (splitting bills or alternating payments), and the call to action is implicit (support the idea of equal sharing). However, the statement could be more emotionally resonant by focusing on the positive outcomes of equitable relationships, such as increased happiness and stability.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of supporting evidence.\n   Impact on Audience: Without evidence, the claims appear as mere assertions. This weakens the persuasive power of the argument, especially for audience members who are skeptical or require data to be convinced.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add brief statistics or examples to support each main point. For example, cite studies on the financial burden on men in traditional dating or examples of how financial disparities lead to power imbalances in relationships.\n\n2. Issue: Limited emotional appeal.\n   Impact on Audience: The argument is primarily logical and rational. While this is important, it may not fully engage the audience's emotions or personal values. This can make the argument less memorable and less likely to inspire action.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Include a short, compelling story or anecdote about a relationship that benefited from equal sharing of expenses or suffered from financial imbalance. This can help the audience connect with the argument on a more emotional level.\n\n3. Issue: Abstract arguments could be more specific.\n   Impact on Audience: Some of the benefits discussed (gender equality, reduced power imbalances) are somewhat abstract. The audience might struggle to understand the tangible effects in day-to-day dating situations.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Illustrate each point with more concrete examples. For instance, when discussing gender equality, mention how equal sharing allows women to initiate dates or activities without feeling constrained by financial expectations. When discussing power imbalances, describe how equal sharing allows both partners to voice their opinions on date locations and activities freely.\n"

First and foremost, equal sharing actively promotes gender equality by challenging outdated traditional dating scripts. For generations, society has placed the financial burden of dating primarily on men.

Think about it: when one partner consistently pays more, it can inadvertently create a sense of obligation or even control. According to research by *Tichenor in 2021*, financial dominance can lead to control issues, where the higher-earning partner might make unilateral decisions, creating a parent-child dynamic rather than a partnership of equals.

This is absolutely crucial for long-term compatibility. Dating isn't just about romance; it's about finding a partner with whom you can build a future.

Discussing expenses early on sets a precedent for addressing financial matters honestly and openly, which is essential for a successful long-term partnership. In fact, *Fidelity* reported that *84%* of couples who communicate well about finances say that money isn't their greatest relationship challenge.\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. This approach promotes gender equality, reduces power imbalances, and fosters open communication, laying the foundation for healthier, more equitable, and ultimately more fulfilling relationships.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

        "statement": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

\n**Claim:** The commonly cited 50% divorce rate is false.\n**Purpose:** rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;attack => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** While our initial debate framing wasn't ideal, the core argument remains: the common claim that 50% of marriages end in divorce is simply false.\n**Argument:** The commonly cited 50% divorce rate is inaccurate.\n\n**Claim:** The actual divorce rate is around 25%, not 50%.\n**Purpose:** rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;attack => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** 122.8 million US adults are married, while 29 million are divorced.  This translates to roughly a 25% divorce rate, not 50%.\n**Argument:** Based on US adult population data, the divorce rate is approximately 25%.\n\n**Claim:** The number of married couples has steadily risen, indicating a growing institution.\n**Purpose:** rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;attack => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** Furthermore, the number of married couples has steadily risen since 1960, from 40.6 million to over 61.4 million in 2021. This demonstrates not a crumbling institution, but a growing one.\n**Argument:** The number of married couples has increased since 1960. This growth suggests marriage is not a declining institution.\n\n**Claim:** The real divorce rate is even lower than previously stated, hitting a 50-year low in 2019.\n**Purpose:** rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;attack => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** While our initial focus was on refuting the 50% figure, current data suggests the real divorce rate is even lower.

        "original_statement": "The opposition suggests that our approach to equally splitting dating expenses is flawed and can undermine equity. But what's truly flawed is the idea that we advocate for rigidity. Our core principle is equity, a commitment to fairness that actively challenges outdated gender norms. It's not about a calculated transaction; it's about establishing a shared sense of responsibility. Imagine dismissing car maintenance to save money \u2013 a short-term gain for long-term disaster. Similarly, ignoring equity sets up the relationship for future imbalances.\n\nThe opponents also claim that we disregard individual financial capacities. But we recognize that financial situations vary. It's not about burdening a student but about open communication and finding a comfortable way for both partners to contribute. Picture a single mom dating a businessperson. They might split smaller expenses while the businessperson covers larger ones. This promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. The point is equity, not identical spending.\n\nAnd what about non-monetary contributions? We agree, emotional support and household chores are valuable. However, financial contributions are also important. It's about creating a balanced partnership, acknowledging all forms of value.\n\nThe opposition further argues that equal spending masks power imbalances. But consider this: constructing a building requires a solid foundation before adding aesthetics. Similarly, establishing financial transparency creates a basis for addressing deeper power dynamics.\n\nFinally, let's revisit why we champion equal sharing: It confronts gender stereotypes, fostering mutual respect. Discussing expenses establishes healthy financial communication. When you share expenses, you're sharing responsibility, not just splitting a bill, you cultivate trust. The goal isn't to solve all relationship imbalances, it is to create a culture of respect where partners feel empowered and valued.",

We are reinforcing our claims of promoting gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships by explaining how our proposal encourages flexibility and open communication, recognizing all forms of contribution, financial and non-financial, to create a truly balanced partnership. (20 words)\n\n- Rebut Opponent's Claim that a strictly equal approach to sharing dating expenses is flawed and can undermine equity (75 words): Argue that while a strictly equal approach might seem flawed, the core principle is equity, and it reinforces gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. The underlying assumption is that equal financial contribution doesn't translate to gender equality. Use analogy of a car and appeal to ridicule by saying equal sharing makes the relationship a mere transaction.\n- Rebut Opponent's Claim that it disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment (90 words): Acknowledge that financial capacities vary, then argue it's not about burdening someone but about open communication. It also promote open communication and reduces financial stress. Use examples of a single mom dating a businessperson to illustrate this.\n- Rebut Opponent's Claim that it undermines the value of non-monetary contributions (80 words): Acknowledge that non-monetary contributions are valuable and it creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n- Rebut Opponent's Claim that equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances (75 words): Agree that it doesn't automatically eliminate power imbalances but that it's a step towards greater transparency and fairness. Mention the goal isn't to solve all imbalances. Also, use the example of building construction to show that some important aspects come first.\n- Reinforce our Claims on gender equality, communication, and balanced partnership. (100 words)",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal effectively addresses the opponent's main points, clarifying the \"for\" side's stance and reinforcing their commitment to equity. The logical flow is generally clear, responding to each of the opponent's arguments in turn. However, the argument could be strengthened by more explicitly linking each rebuttal point back to the core principle of equity.\n\nEngagement Impact: The use of analogies (car maintenance, constructing a building) is somewhat effective in illustrating the importance of equity and financial transparency. The examples (single mom dating a businessperson) are relatable and help to clarify the \"for\" side's flexibility. However, the rebuttal could benefit from more vivid language and storytelling to capture the audience's attention and make the points more memorable.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The rebuttal focuses primarily on defending the \"for\" side's position and refuting the opponent's arguments, rather than presenting new evidence. While this is appropriate for a rebuttal, incorporating a few key statistics or examples could strengthen the arguments. For example, citing data on the benefits of financial transparency in relationships or the prevalence of gender inequality in dating could add weight to the claims.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The rebuttal effectively appeals to the audience's sense of fairness and equity, emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and open communication. The focus on challenging outdated gender norms is likely to resonate with many audience members. The rebuttal clearly articulates the \"for\" side's vision of a healthy and equitable relationship. However, the emotional impact could be enhanced by focusing more on the positive outcomes of equal sharing, such as increased trust and intimacy.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of concrete evidence.\n   Impact on Audience: While the analogies are helpful, the rebuttal would be more persuasive if it included some concrete evidence to support its claims. The audience may be skeptical of the arguments without data or examples to back them up.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence or two with a statistic or real-world example to support each main point. For example, when discussing financial transparency, cite a study that shows a correlation between open communication about finances and relationship satisfaction.\n\n2. Issue: Missed opportunity to directly counter the opponent's evidence.\n   Impact on Audience: The opponent cited specific sources and studies. A stronger rebuttal would directly address those specific pieces of evidence, pointing out flaws in their methodology or offering alternative interpretations.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Identify the strongest piece of evidence presented by the opponent (e.g., the study on couples arguing about money) and offer a counter-argument or alternative interpretation. For example, you could argue that while couples may argue about money, equal sharing can help to prevent those arguments by establishing clear expectations and promoting financial transparency.\n\n3. Issue: The analogies, while helpful, could be more directly linked to the core arguments.\n   Impact on Audience: The connection between the analogy and the argument is sometimes implicit rather than explicit, potentially losing some audience members.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: After presenting the analogy, explicitly state how it relates to the core argument. For example, after the car maintenance analogy, add a sentence like: \"Just as neglecting car maintenance leads to long-term problems, ignoring equity in a relationship sets the stage for future imbalances and resentment.\" This reinforces the connection and ensures that the audience understands the point being made.\n"

            "Our opponents suggest that equally splitting dating expenses is a flawed approach that can undermine equity. But what's truly flawed is the idea that we advocate for rigidity. Our core principle is equity, a commitment to fairness that actively challenges outdated gender norms. It's not about a calculated transaction; it's about establishing a shared sense of responsibility. Imagine dismissing car maintenance to save money \u2013 a short-term gain for long-term disaster. Similarly, ignoring equity sets up the relationship for future imbalances and resentment.\n\nThe opposition also claims that we disregard individual financial capacities. But we recognize that financial situations vary. It's not about burdening a student but about open communication and finding a comfortable way for both partners to contribute. Picture a single mom dating a businessperson. They might split smaller expenses while the businessperson covers larger ones. This promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. The point is equity, not identical spending.\n\nAnd what about non-monetary contributions? We agree, emotional support and household chores are valuable. However, financial contributions are also important. It's about creating a balanced partnership, acknowledging all forms of value.\n\nThe opposition further argues that equal spending masks power imbalances. But consider this: constructing a building requires a solid foundation before adding aesthetics. Similarly, establishing financial transparency creates a basis for addressing deeper power dynamics.\n\nNow, let's reinforce why we champion equal sharing. It confronts gender stereotypes, fosters mutual respect, and establishes healthy financial communication. When you share expenses, you're sharing responsibility, not just splitting a bill, you cultivate trust. The goal isn't to solve all relationship imbalances, it is to create a culture of respect where partners feel empowered and valued.\n\nOur opponents argue that a strictly equal approach to sharing dating expenses is flawed and can undermine equity. They suggest that equal sharing disregards individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment. They also claim that it undermines the value of non-monetary contributions and masks underlying power imbalances. However, their arguments oversimplify the complexities of our approach.\n\nWhile a strictly equal approach might seem flawed on the surface, our core principle is equity. This principle reinforces gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. It's about moving away from outdated expectations where one partner, often the man, is expected to bear the brunt of the financial burden. As highlighted in *a 2024 article about Gender Roles*, traditional gender roles can create imbalances in relationships, leading to unequal distribution of responsibilities and power. We are not suggesting that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, but it's a significant step in that direction. It sets a precedent for a relationship where both partners feel valued and responsible.\n\nWe acknowledge that financial capacities vary, and our approach isn't about burdening someone. It's about open communication and finding a comfortable way for both partners to contribute. As *the Journal of Financial Therapy* points out, initiating financial discussions earlier in a relationship benefits the quality of financial communication between partners. Consider the example of a single mom dating a businessperson. They might split smaller expenses while the businessperson covers larger ones. This promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. The point is equity, not identical spending.\n\nWe also recognize that non-monetary contributions are valuable. Emotional support, household chores, and other forms of support are essential to a healthy relationship. However, financial contributions are also important. It's about creating a balanced partnership, acknowledging all forms of value. By openly discussing and sharing financial responsibilities, couples can create a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nEqual spending doesn't automatically eliminate power imbalances, but it's a step towards greater transparency and fairness. As *experts in Financial Transparency* suggest, it creates a solid foundation of understanding and trust between partners. Our goal isn't to solve all relationship imbalances with one simple solution. It's to create a culture of respect where partners feel empowered and valued.\n\nUltimately, we champion equal sharing because it confronts gender stereotypes, fosters mutual respect, and establishes healthy financial communication. When you share expenses, you're sharing responsibility, not just splitting a bill. You're cultivating trust and setting the stage for a more equitable and fulfilling relationship.\n\n**Reference**\n1. Let's Talk About Money in Our Intimate Relationships! 2019\n2.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

        "statement": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their mischaracterization of our definition, their misunderstanding of the relationship between financial contributions and equality, their downplaying of the importance of financial equity in dating, and their misconstrual of potential power dynamics. By addressing these flaws, we will demonstrate how our model fosters more equitable relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to portray our definition of \"shared equally\" as a rigid, inflexible 50/50 split, ignoring the nuances of modern relationships; however, we never claimed it was an inflexible mandate. Our definition aims for a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a baseline for equitable contribution. This is not a rigid mandate, but rather a commitment to equality, acknowledging that open communication and mutual agreement can lead to adjustments based on individual circumstances. It's about the *intention* of equality, not necessarily rigid adherence to the number. This promotes equity while providing structure that their vague, \"flexible\" approach lacks. Their approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes. Therefore, maintaining our definition strengthens the basis of our equitable relationship.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships, citing a study that 56% of couples argue about money [1]. However, it's a straw man fallacy to say that we believe it *automatically* translates to these things. We argue that it *fosters* these positive outcomes. Furthermore, all disagreements are bad for relationships. Even if couples disagree about money, that doesn't mean it's worse than other topics to disagree on. In fact, regularly discussing shared expenses helps to foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. This aligns with the finding that couples who have similar spending habits, savings goals, and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship [6]. Thus, our model encourages healthier communication patterns compared to the opposition's, which lacks a proactive approach to financial discussions.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a strictly equal split disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment, citing Tu (2023). However, *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment if not discussed openly and agreed upon. That\u2019s why our definition allows for adjustments as long as both parties are communicating. It is crucial to ensure financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. The negative's \"flexible\" approach lacks structure and is *more* prone to inequity without a baseline to work from. Ultimately, open communication and a commitment to finding a fair balance are essential for a healthy relationship [4]. This focus on open communication about the intention of equal independence makes our argument stronger than the status quo.\n\nFinally, the negative argues that the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances, citing K\u00f6rner and Sch\u00fctz (2021). However, our model is meant to prevent this! The *intention* of the 50/50 split is to *address* potential power imbalances, not mask them. By having open conversations about finances, couples are more likely to identify and address underlying issues. In relationships, when couples contribute, this allows them to focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about one person footing the bill all the time and the dynamic that creates in your relationship [7].

        "statement": "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents are attempting to build a house on a shaky foundation. The real question isn't whether fairness is a good thing, but whether a rigid 50/50 split of dating expenses actually gets us there. As I'll demonstrate, it falls short.\n\nFirst, let's examine their idea of \"shared equally.\" They suggest the 50/50 split is a flexible aim. However, their entire argument rests on achieving equality through strictly equal contributions. This very definition forces a potentially awkward and biased conversation about finances. This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion. It creates an implicit pressure, contradicting the intention of open and unbiased financial discussions.\n\nSecond, they argue that equal sharing promotes gender equality. Now, we never claimed that equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. However, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships. This provides only a facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we risk devaluing non-monetary contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership. For example, who is taking care of the house chores? Who is planning the dates? These are all contributions that should be valued.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. They assume that splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. But did you know that even when couples split expenses 50/50, a significant number still argue about money? In fact, *radcoaches, a financial coach and happy couple of over 10 years*, found that couples who focus heavily on equal financial contributions also tend to have other negative money habits that hurt the relationship. This statistic highlights that equal division is not a cure-all for financial disagreements. Transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As *Healthline* reports, emotional manipulation in relationships can take many forms, including financial control. This can manifest as pressuring a partner to spend beyond their means or using financial contributions as leverage in disagreements.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. As *Psychology Today* reported in their article \"Financial Strain and Relationship Health,\" financial strain can lead to increased depressive symptoms and less satisfaction in the relationship. Therefore, financial instability can lead to a vicious cycle that can take a toll on the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

The central point of contention has been the definition of \"shared equally.\" Our opponents argue that our 50/50 split is inflexible, and they want you to believe that financial conversations will automatically lead to awkwardness. But that's simply not the case.\n\nWe've established that our 50/50 split is a baseline, a starting point for discussion. Without a baseline, how can true equity ever be achieved?\n\nWe've shown that our model, with its emphasis on open financial conversation, actually fosters healthier communication. It directly addresses financial stress and challenges outdated gender roles. The opposition's \"flexible\" approach lacks any real structure. How comfortable would *you* feel entering a relationship with absolutely no financial framework in place?\n\nOur model promotes financial transparency, which allows couples to identify and address potential power imbalances. The opposition claims that financial strain leads to depressive symptoms, but remember that the status quo places even more pressure on the person paying the entire bill.\n\nThe crucial issue here is the *intention* behind equal sharing. Our 50/50 split aims to *address* potential power imbalances head-on. We encourage financial transparency, empowering both partners to have open and honest conversations about money. The opposition's approach lacks this proactive element. They prioritize flexibility, which sounds appealing but lacks a solid foundation in reality. Therefore, we urge you to vote in favor of equal sharing, creating stronger, more equitable partnerships built on mutual respect and understanding.",

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their mischaracterization of our definition, their misunderstanding of the relationship between financial contributions and equality, their downplaying of the importance of financial equity in dating, and their misconstrual of potential power dynamics. By addressing these flaws, we will demonstrate how our model fosters more equitable relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to portray our definition of \"shared equally\" as a rigid, inflexible 50/50 split, ignoring the nuances of modern relationships; however, we never claimed it was an inflexible mandate. Our definition aims for a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a baseline for equitable contribution. This is not a rigid mandate, but rather a commitment to equality, acknowledging that open communication and mutual agreement can lead to adjustments based on individual circumstances. It's about the *intention* of equality, not necessarily rigid adherence to the number. This promotes equity while providing structure that their vague, \"flexible\" approach lacks. Their approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes. Therefore, maintaining our definition strengthens the basis of our equitable relationship.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships, citing a study that 56% of couples argue about money [1]. However, it's a straw man fallacy to say that we believe it *automatically* translates to these things. We argue that it *fosters* these positive outcomes. Furthermore, all disagreements are bad for relationships. Even if couples disagree about money, that doesn't mean it's worse than other topics to disagree on. In fact, regularly discussing shared expenses helps to foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. This aligns with the finding that couples who have similar spending habits, savings goals, and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship [6]. Thus, our model encourages healthier communication patterns compared to the opposition's, which lacks a proactive approach to financial discussions.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a strictly equal split disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment, citing Tu (2023). However, *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment if not discussed openly and agreed upon. That\u2019s why our definition allows for adjustments as long as both parties are communicating. It is crucial to ensure financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. The negative's \"flexible\" approach lacks structure and is *more* prone to inequity without a baseline to work from. Ultimately, open communication and a commitment to finding a fair balance are essential for a healthy relationship [4]. This focus on open communication about the intention of equal independence makes our argument stronger than the status quo.\n\nFinally, the negative argues that the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances, citing K\u00f6rner and Sch\u00fctz (2021). However, our model is meant to prevent this! The *intention* of the 50/50 split is to *address* potential power imbalances, not mask them. By having open conversations about finances, couples are more likely to identify and address underlying issues. In relationships, when couples contribute, this allows them to focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about one person footing the bill all the time and the dynamic that creates in your relationship [7]. By encouraging financial transparency,\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n(2) Tu.

        "statement": "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents are attempting to build a house on a shaky foundation. The real question isn't whether fairness is a good thing, but whether a rigid 50/50 split of dating expenses actually gets us there. As I'll demonstrate, it falls short.\n\nFirst, let's examine their idea of \"shared equally.\" They suggest the 50/50 split is a flexible aim. However, their entire argument rests on achieving equality through strictly equal contributions. This very definition forces a potentially awkward and biased conversation about finances. This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion. It creates an implicit pressure, contradicting the intention of open and unbiased financial discussions.\n\nSecond, they argue that equal sharing promotes gender equality. Now, we never claimed that equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. However, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships. This provides only a facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we risk devaluing non-monetary contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership. For example, who is taking care of the house chores? Who is planning the dates? These are all contributions that should be valued.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. They assume that splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. But did you know that even when couples split expenses 50/50, a significant number still argue about money? In fact, *radcoaches, a financial coach and happy couple of over 10 years*, found that couples who focus heavily on equal financial contributions also tend to have other negative money habits that hurt the relationship. This statistic highlights that equal division is not a cure-all for financial disagreements. Transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As *Healthline* reports, emotional manipulation in relationships can take many forms, including financial control. This can manifest as pressuring a partner to spend beyond their means or using financial contributions as leverage in disagreements.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. As *Psychology Today* reported in their article \"Financial Strain and Relationship Health,\" financial strain can lead to increased depressive symptoms and less satisfaction in the relationship. Therefore, financial instability can lead to a vicious cycle that can take a toll on the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around establishing equitable relationships through the sharing of dating expenses.\n\nThe core of the opposition's argument is that our proposal for a 50/50 split is too rigid. However, we propose a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a *framework* for initiating open and honest conversations about finances. It's a commitment to equality, acknowledging that adjustments can\u2014and should\u2014be made based on individual circumstances [1]. Their \"flexible\" approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes.\n\nThey also claim that focusing on a 50/50 split creates a \"facade of gender equality,\" neglecting non-monetary contributions. We agree those contributions are valuable! However, unlike financial contributions, those are subjective and harder to quantify. Without a clear financial baseline, these non-monetary contributions can be easily exploited, leading to real power imbalances [2].\n\nThe opposition argues that even when couples split expenses 50/50, they still argue about money. Again, we never claimed splitting 50/50 *eliminates* disagreements! But it *fosters* healthier communication by providing a structure for discussing finances openly and regularly [3]. It encourages a *proactive* approach to financial discussions.\n\nUltimately, our model isn't about rigid numbers; it's about fairness, respect, and autonomy. We believe our side provides the fairest approach because it promotes equal contribution and reduces the potential for one partner to be financially burdened or taken advantage of [4].\n\nTherefore, we urge you to affirm: dating expenses *should* be shared equally, as a framework for an equitable relationship.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions.\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence.\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships.

        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan**\n\nAlright, let's break down our strategy for this opening statement. First, we'll address the opponent's definitions and judging criteria. While their definitions of 'dating expenses' and 'equitable relationships' seem reasonable on the surface, we need to highlight their oversimplification. A quick challenge will suffice here.\n\nThen, we'll directly attack their main claims, focusing on gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. The core of our rebuttal will be that equal splitting doesn't automatically guarantee these outcomes, and can even be detrimental in certain situations. We'll introduce our three main claims: the unfair burden on those with fewer resources, the devaluation of non-monetary contributions, and the potential to mask power imbalances. These claims directly counter the opponent's arguments and demonstrate the flaws in their proposed model.\n\nWe'll be employing rhetorical techniques like **appeals to common sense** and **examples** to illustrate how strict equal splitting can be impractical and unfair in real-world scenarios. We'll also be pointing out the **false equivalency** in their argument, which assumes that equal financial contribution automatically equals respect and equality. By addressing these logical fallacies, we'll weaken their position and strengthen our own.\n\nSpecifically:\n- **Definitions and Judging Criteria (50 words):** Brief critique to set the stage for our argument.\n- **Attacking Opponent's Claims (250 words):** Directly address and refute their key points about gender equality, communication, and balanced partnerships.\n- **Proposing Our Claims (222 words):** Introduce and explain our three main arguments against equal splitting.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe core message, arguing against a rigid 50/50 split of dating expenses and advocating for a more nuanced approach, is generally clear. The opening paragraph sets the stage by challenging the opponent's definition and hinting at the complexities that will be explored. The logical flow is easy to follow, with each paragraph addressing a specific flaw in the opponent's argument. The statement avoids complex jargon, making it accessible to a general audience.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe statement uses relatable scenarios (student vs. working professional, household chores) to engage the audience and illustrate the flaws of a strictly equal approach. The rhetorical questions (\"Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing?\") are effective at prompting thought and maintaining audience attention. The memorability is reasonable, especially the key phrase \"equality does not always equate to equity.\"\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe statement relies primarily on logical arguments and hypothetical scenarios rather than empirical data or expert opinions. This is a weakness, as it makes the claims less persuasive. While the lack of specific evidence keeps the statement accessible, it also makes it less convincing.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe statement effectively appeals to the audience's sense of fairness and empathy by highlighting the potential for unequal burden and resentment under a strictly equal system. It offers a practical alternative\u2014a \"more nuanced and flexible approach\"\u2014which increases its relevance. The call to action is implicit: to reject the opponent's rigid model in favor of a more holistic understanding of equitable relationships. The emotional resonance is generated by highlighting potential imbalances and unfairness, leading to a general agreement among the audience.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Lack of Concrete Examples or Evidence.**\n   Impact on Audience: The arguments, while logical, feel somewhat abstract and speculative. The absence of real-world examples or data to support the claim that a 50/50 split can be detrimental weakens the persuasive impact, especially for audience members who value empirical evidence.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Include a brief, relatable anecdote or statistic illustrating a situation where a rigid 50/50 split led to negative consequences (e.g., \"Studies have shown that financial disagreements are a leading cause of relationship stress, particularly when one partner feels unfairly burdened\").\n\n2. Issue: **Over-reliance on Hypothetical Scenarios.**\n   Impact on Audience: While the \"student vs. working professional\" scenario is effective, relying heavily on hypotheticals can make the argument seem theoretical and less grounded in reality. The audience may question the frequency or significance of these scenarios.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Supplement the hypothetical scenarios with references to common financial planning advice or relationship counseling perspectives that caution against rigid financial arrangements (e.g., \"Financial advisors often recommend tailoring financial contributions to individual circumstances to avoid resentment and power imbalances\").\n\n3. Issue: **Implicit Call to Action.**\n   Impact on Audience: The statement concludes by advocating for a \"more nuanced and flexible approach,\" but it doesn't explicitly define what this approach entails. This lack of clarity may leave the audience unsure of what the alternative is.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Briefly outline the key principles of a more nuanced approach. For example, \"This means open communication about financial capacities, valuing non-monetary contributions, and prioritizing mutual comfort and well-being over strict adherence to a 50/50 split.\"\n\n4. Issue: **Failure to pre-emptively respond to possible opponent's response**\n   Impact on Audience: The opponent's response may involve an argument for the current status quo. Currently, there is no mention of that or a response to that argument in this opening statement.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a sentence or two mentioning current common practice. E.g. \"We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50\"\n"

        "statement": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing?

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.",

        "statement": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their mischaracterization of our definition, their misunderstanding of the relationship between financial contributions and equality, their downplaying of the importance of financial equity in dating, and their misconstrual of potential power dynamics. By addressing these flaws, we will demonstrate how our model fosters more equitable relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to portray our definition of \"shared equally\" as a rigid, inflexible 50/50 split, ignoring the nuances of modern relationships; however, we never claimed it was an inflexible mandate. Our definition aims for a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a baseline for equitable contribution. This is not a rigid mandate, but rather a commitment to equality, acknowledging that open communication and mutual agreement can lead to adjustments based on individual circumstances. It's about the *intention* of equality, not necessarily rigid adherence to the number. This promotes equity while providing structure that their vague, \"flexible\" approach lacks. Their approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes. Therefore, maintaining our definition strengthens the basis of our equitable relationship.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships, citing a study that 56% of couples argue about money [1]. However, it's a straw man fallacy to say that we believe it *automatically* translates to these things. We argue that it *fosters* these positive outcomes. Furthermore, all disagreements are bad for relationships. Even if couples disagree about money, that doesn't mean it's worse than other topics to disagree on. In fact, regularly discussing shared expenses helps to foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. This aligns with the finding that couples who have similar spending habits, savings goals, and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship [6]. Thus, our model encourages healthier communication patterns compared to the opposition's, which lacks a proactive approach to financial discussions.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a strictly equal split disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment, citing Tu (2023). However, *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment if not discussed openly and agreed upon. That\u2019s why our definition allows for adjustments as long as both parties are communicating. It is crucial to ensure financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. The negative's \"flexible\" approach lacks structure and is *more* prone to inequity without a baseline to work from. Ultimately, open communication and a commitment to finding a fair balance are essential for a healthy relationship [4]. This focus on open communication about the intention of equal independence makes our argument stronger than the status quo.\n\nFinally, the negative argues that the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances, citing K\u00f6rner and Sch\u00fctz (2021). However, our model is meant to prevent this! The *intention* of the 50/50 split is to *address* potential power imbalances, not mask them. By having open conversations about finances, couples are more likely to identify and address underlying issues. In relationships, when couples contribute, this allows them to focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about one person footing the bill all the time and the dynamic that creates in your relationship [7]. By encouraging financial transparency,\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n(2) Tu.

the divorce rate exceeds 10%, not whether it's 50%.\n**Purpose:** attack => The commonly cited 50% divorce rate is a myth.;rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** The core argument here is simple:  This debate hinges on whether the divorce rate is below 10%, not whether it's 50%.  While I concede the divorce rate isn't 50%, that's irrelevant to the resolution.\n**Argument:** The resolution's focus is on the 10% threshold, not the 50% figure. The actual divorce rate not being 50% is irrelevant to the core debate.\n\n**Claim:** The resolution needs a single benchmark, and here, it\u2019s 10%.\n**Purpose:** attack => The commonly cited 50% divorce rate is a myth.;rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** My opponent's interpretation creates a double-standard, asking if the rate is both below 50% *and* below 10%.  This makes judging impossible. If I prove it's above 10% and they prove it's below 50%, who wins?  A resolution needs a single benchmark, and here, it\u2019s 10%.  My opponent explicitly stated this in their title and description.\n**Argument:** The opponent's interpretation creates a double standard. A single benchmark is needed for a clear resolution. The 10% figure is the explicit benchmark in the resolution.\n\n**Claim:** Evidence demonstrates the divorce rate exceeds 10%.\n**Purpose:** rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** My sources demonstrate the divorce rate exceeds 10%, whether looking at US figures, global averages, or median rates across countries.  My opponent even concedes a 25% US divorce rate, far exceeding the 10% threshold.  Furthermore, the provided list of occupations with divorce rates over 50% further supports my position.\n**Argument:** Multiple sources show divorce rates above 10%. The opponent concedes a 25% US divorce rate. Occupations with divorce rates over 50% support the claim.\n\n**Claim:** The resolution's wording implies the 10% figure is the key point.\n**Purpose:** attack => The commonly cited 50% divorce rate is a myth.;rebut => The critical point is whether the divorce rate exceeds 10%, and the evidence confirms that it does.;\n**Content:** The resolution's wording itself implies the 10% figure is the key point. Why else specify \"much much lower\" than 50%?  If the debate was solely about the 50% figure, such specificity is misleading.\n**Argument:** The phrase 'much much lower' implies a focus on the 10% figure. Specificity is misleading if the debate was solely about the 50% figure.\n\n**Claim:** The opponent hasn't proven the rate is 'much much lower' than 50%.\n**Purpose:** attack => The commonly cited 50% divorce rate is a myth.;\n**Content:** Finally, even if we entertain the double benchmark idea, my opponent hasn't met their burden. They haven't proven the rate is \"much much lower\" than 50%, and their reliance on extensive quotes weakens their arguments.  At best, this is a draw, which favors the Con side due to the Pro side's burden of proof.\n**Argument:** The opponent hasn't met their burden of proof. Reliance on extensive quotes weakens their arguments. A draw favors the Con side due to the Pro side's burden of proof.\n===================================\n\n"

        "original_statement": "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents attempt to build a castle on sand. The crucial issue here is not whether fairness is desirable, but whether a strictly equal 50/50 financial split in dating expenses actually achieves it. As you'll see, it doesn't.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s discuss their definition of \u201cshared equally.\u201d They claim the 50/50 split is a flexible goal, yet their core argument is based on ensuring equality via shared contributions. This very definition forces a potentially biased, uncomfortable conversation about finances! This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion!\n\nSecond, they claim that equal sharing fosters gender equality. Let's be clear: We never said equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. Rather, their approach provides only the facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we devalue these contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. Did you know that even if couples split everything 50/50, 56% of them still argue about money? Their model wrongly assumes splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. Instead, transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOur strategy is to undermine the core premise of the opposition\u2019s stance: that equal sharing of dating expenses inherently fosters equitable relationships. We will achieve this by directly attacking their definition of \u201cshared equally,\u201d exposing the contradictions in their arguments, and reinforcing the idea that a strictly equal approach can actually be detrimental.\n\n1.  **Attack: Definition of Shared Equally (75 words)**: We challenge their claim that the 50/50 split is a flexible goal by highlighting that their definition mandates a starting point of equality. This requirement creates an implicit pressure and contradicts the intention of open and unbiased discussions about finances. We use the logical fallacy of self-contradiction.\n\n2.  **Attack: Fosters Gender Equality (100 words)**: Expose the Straw Man: Their argument relies on the Straw Man fallacy by claiming the negative thinks they believe in automatic translation. Equal financial contribution, while a step, is not a guaranteed fix. Argue that their plan distracts from non-financial contributions.\n\n3.  **Attack: Promotes Open Communication (100 words)**: We highlight that while open communication is key, equal splitting expenses doesn\u2019t automatically translate. By presenting the statistic about couples arguing about money, we emphasize that equal division is not a cure-all, and we question the causal link. We use the error logic technique.\n\n4.  **Attack: Balanced and Respectful Partnership (75 words)**: Argue that their model assumes power imbalances can be solved by equal split but it cannot. Argue that balanced and respectful partnership is not solely based on financial contribution. We will use the error logic technique.\n\n5.  **Reinforce: Detrimental (100 words)**: We reiterate how the expectation of strict equality can harm individuals with limited resources. Emphasize the unfair burden and link back to the overall goal of equity, highlighting how their approach can be counterproductive.\n\n6.  **Wrap up (72 words)**: End by explaining their intention may be good, but the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Argue that focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture of equity.",

          "## Comprehensive Analysis\n\n**Core Message Clarity:**\nThe rebuttal aims to dismantle the opponent's arguments point by point, which is a standard and effective strategy. The opening sentence introduces a metaphor (\"castle on sand\") to frame the opponent's argument as fundamentally weak. Each paragraph addresses a specific claim made by the opposition, attempting to expose logical flaws and unintended consequences. The overall message, that a strict 50/50 split is not a reliable path to equity, is clear.\n\n**Engagement Impact:**\nThe use of rhetorical questions (\"Did you know that even if couples split everything 50/50, 56% of them still argue about money?\") attempts to engage the audience and highlight the counterintuitive nature of the opponent's claims. The framing of the 50/50 split as placing \"undue strain\" on individuals with limited resources connects with audience concerns about fairness and financial well-being. The analogy of \"building a castle on sand\" helps to create a memorable image.\n\n**Evidence Presentation:**\nThe rebuttal references the statistic about 56% of couples arguing about money, which directly counters the opponent's claim that equal sharing promotes open communication. However, the rebuttal primarily relies on logical arguments and appeals to common sense rather than presenting extensive data or expert opinions.\n\n**Persuasive Elements:**\nThe statement effectively uses the strategy of turning the opponent's arguments against them (e.g., arguing that the demand for a split implies equality is the starting point, not the result). The appeal to fairness and the highlighting of potential negative consequences (undue strain on limited resources) are persuasive elements. The conclusion reinforces the central message that focusing solely on financial contributions misses the bigger picture of equitable relationships.\n\n## Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions\n\n1. Issue: **Lack of Specific Rebuttal to Opponent's Evidence.**\n   Impact on Audience: The opponent's rebuttal cites multiple sources including academic journals, news articles, and financial websites. The current response only uses one single data point to refute their claims. This potentially harms the credibility of the argument.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Explicitly engage with the reference sources brought up. E.g. \"The study in 'Couples Financial Coach. 50/50 Relationship' is based on correlational data and does not establish causation. In that sense, while some couples may feel it is helpful, it is a stretch to say that this is a helpful framework for all couples.\"\n\n2. Issue: **Vague Discussion of \"Nuanced\" and \"Big Picture\".**\n   Impact on Audience: While the rebuttal argues for a more \"nuanced\" approach and emphasizes the \"big picture,\" it doesn't fully articulate what these alternatives entail. The audience might be left wondering what a truly equitable solution looks like.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Offer a more concrete vision of what a \"nuanced\" approach would involve. For example, \"Instead of a rigid split, couples should openly discuss their financial situations, prioritize individual needs, and value non-monetary contributions. The goal is to foster a sense of mutual support and shared responsibility, not to adhere to an arbitrary financial formula.\"\n\n3. Issue: **Potential Mischaracterization of Opponent's Argument (Straw Man).**\n   Impact on Audience: The rebuttal repeatedly claims that the opponent believes equal sharing *automatically* leads to equality and eliminates financial stress. If the opponent didn't explicitly make these claims, the rebuttal risks misrepresenting their position and weakening its own credibility.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Reframe the rebuttal to focus on the *implications* of the opponent's argument rather than directly accusing them of holding unrealistic beliefs. For example, \"While my opponent may not explicitly state that equal sharing automatically leads to equality, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships.\"\n\n4. Issue: **Missing acknowledgment of current status quo**\n   Impact on Audience: The current argument for the motion is that the 50/50 split better promotes gender equality, challenges traditional gender roles, fosters open communication, reduces financial stress, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. However, the side against is not directly engaging with this.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a refutation or acknowledgment of this status quo. For example, \"While we acknowledge that in the past men generally footed the bill, we should not assume that a 50/50 split is better or worse than a man footing the bill for gender equality, open communication, reduced financial stress, and more respect.\"\n"

Did you know that even if couples split everything 50/50, a significant percentage still argue about money? Their model wrongly assumes splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. Instead, transparency stems from commitment, trust, and a willingness to openly discuss financial situations, regardless of how expenses are divided.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is supposedly to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As *Healthline* reported, emotional manipulation often involves seizing power in a relationship to control the other person mentally, physically, financially, or emotionally. Insisting on a 50/50 split can be a form of financial control, masking deeper power imbalances within the relationship.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. This is especially relevant considering the psychological effects of financial stress on relationships. *Psychology Today* reported in 2024 that financial stress affects people\u2019s moods, and worrying about one\u2019s financial situation has been linked to feeling more upset, stressed, angry, and sad. Imposing a rigid financial structure can exacerbate these negative feelings, leading to decreased relationship satisfaction for both partners.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions, both monetary and non-monetary, and foster open communication based on trust and understanding, not rigid formulas.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

            "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents attempt to build a castle on sand. The crucial issue here is not whether fairness is desirable, but whether a strictly equal 50/50 financial split in dating expenses actually achieves it. As you'll see, it doesn't.\n\nFirstly, let\u2019s discuss their definition of \u201cshared equally.\u201d They claim the 50/50 split is a flexible goal, yet their core argument is based on ensuring equality via shared contributions. But this very definition forces a potentially biased, uncomfortable conversation about finances! This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion. It creates an implicit pressure, contradicting the intention of open and unbiased financial discussions.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal sharing fosters gender equality. While my opponent may not explicitly state that equal sharing automatically leads to equality, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships. Let's be clear: we never said equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. Rather, their approach provides only the facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we devalue non-monetary contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. Did you know that even if couples split everything 50/50, a significant percentage still argue about money? According to *radcoaches, a financial coach and happy couple of over 10 years*, couples that focus heavily on equal financial contributions also tend to have other negative money habits that hurt the relationship. Their model wrongly assumes splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. Instead, transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication. In fact, *Psychology Today* published research in 2024 showing that financial stress is linked to less relationship satisfaction, not just in the person feeling stressed but also in their partner.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As highlighted by *Washington, DC*, financial abuse often involves controlling access to resources to make a victim isolated and dependent. This can manifest even when expenses are supposedly split equally, if one partner uses financial contributions to exert power.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. Instead of promoting equality, this approach can exacerbate existing inequalities.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions. As *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz* noted in a 2021 study, financial resources are less likely to influence relationship variables than the actual sense of power in that very relationship. Therefore, let's focus on fostering genuine respect and understanding, rather than adhering to a rigid and potentially harmful financial formula.\n\n**Reference**\n1. Archuleta, K. L., Britt, S.

This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

        "statement": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their mischaracterization of our definition, their misunderstanding of the relationship between financial contributions and equality, their downplaying of the importance of financial equity in dating, and their misconstrual of potential power dynamics. By addressing these flaws, we will demonstrate how our model fosters more equitable relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to portray our definition of \"shared equally\" as a rigid, inflexible 50/50 split, ignoring the nuances of modern relationships; however, we never claimed it was an inflexible mandate. Our definition aims for a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a baseline for equitable contribution. This is not a rigid mandate, but rather a commitment to equality, acknowledging that open communication and mutual agreement can lead to adjustments based on individual circumstances. It's about the *intention* of equality, not necessarily rigid adherence to the number. This promotes equity while providing structure that their vague, \"flexible\" approach lacks. Their approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes. Therefore, maintaining our definition strengthens the basis of our equitable relationship.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships, citing a study that 56% of couples argue about money [1]. However, it's a straw man fallacy to say that we believe it *automatically* translates to these things. We argue that it *fosters* these positive outcomes. Furthermore, all disagreements are bad for relationships. Even if couples disagree about money, that doesn't mean it's worse than other topics to disagree on. In fact, regularly discussing shared expenses helps to foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. This aligns with the finding that couples who have similar spending habits, savings goals, and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship [6]. Thus, our model encourages healthier communication patterns compared to the opposition's, which lacks a proactive approach to financial discussions.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a strictly equal split disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment, citing Tu (2023). However, *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment if not discussed openly and agreed upon. That\u2019s why our definition allows for adjustments as long as both parties are communicating. It is crucial to ensure financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. The negative's \"flexible\" approach lacks structure and is *more* prone to inequity without a baseline to work from. Ultimately, open communication and a commitment to finding a fair balance are essential for a healthy relationship [4]. This focus on open communication about the intention of equal independence makes our argument stronger than the status quo.\n\nFinally, the negative argues that the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances, citing K\u00f6rner and Sch\u00fctz (2021). However, our model is meant to prevent this! The *intention* of the 50/50 split is to *address* potential power imbalances, not mask them. By having open conversations about finances, couples are more likely to identify and address underlying issues. In relationships, when couples contribute, this allows them to focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about one person footing the bill all the time and the dynamic that creates in your relationship [7].

        "statement": "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents are attempting to build a house on a shaky foundation. The real question isn't whether fairness is a good thing, but whether a rigid 50/50 split of dating expenses actually gets us there. As I'll demonstrate, it falls short.\n\nFirst, let's examine their idea of \"shared equally.\" They suggest the 50/50 split is a flexible aim. However, their entire argument rests on achieving equality through strictly equal contributions. This very definition forces a potentially awkward and biased conversation about finances. This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion. It creates an implicit pressure, contradicting the intention of open and unbiased financial discussions.\n\nSecond, they argue that equal sharing promotes gender equality. Now, we never claimed that equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. However, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships. This provides only a facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we risk devaluing non-monetary contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership. For example, who is taking care of the house chores? Who is planning the dates? These are all contributions that should be valued.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. They assume that splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. But did you know that even when couples split expenses 50/50, a significant number still argue about money? In fact, *radcoaches, a financial coach and happy couple of over 10 years*, found that couples who focus heavily on equal financial contributions also tend to have other negative money habits that hurt the relationship. This statistic highlights that equal division is not a cure-all for financial disagreements. Transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As *Healthline* reports, emotional manipulation in relationships can take many forms, including financial control. This can manifest as pressuring a partner to spend beyond their means or using financial contributions as leverage in disagreements.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. As *Psychology Today* reported in their article \"Financial Strain and Relationship Health,\" financial strain can lead to increased depressive symptoms and less satisfaction in the relationship. Therefore, financial instability can lead to a vicious cycle that can take a toll on the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around establishing equitable relationships through the sharing of dating expenses.\n\nThe core of the opposition's argument is that our proposal for a 50/50 split is too rigid. However, we propose a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a *framework* for initiating open and honest conversations about finances. It's a commitment to equality, acknowledging that adjustments can\u2014and should\u2014be made based on individual circumstances [1]. Their \"flexible\" approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes.\n\nThey also claim that focusing on a 50/50 split creates a \"facade of gender equality,\" neglecting non-monetary contributions. We agree those contributions are valuable! However, unlike financial contributions, those are subjective and harder to quantify. Without a clear financial baseline, these non-monetary contributions can be easily exploited, leading to real power imbalances [2].\n\nThe opposition argues that even when couples split expenses 50/50, they still argue about money. Again, we never claimed splitting 50/50 *eliminates* disagreements! But it *fosters* healthier communication by providing a structure for discussing finances openly and regularly [3]. It encourages a *proactive* approach to financial discussions.\n\nUltimately, our model isn't about rigid numbers; it's about fairness, respect, and autonomy. We believe our side provides the fairest approach because it promotes equal contribution and reduces the potential for one partner to be financially burdened or taken advantage of [4].\n\nTherefore, we urge you to affirm: dating expenses *should* be shared equally, as a framework for an equitable relationship.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners to foster equitable relationships.\n\n**Definitions:**\n- **Dating Expenses:** All costs incurred during planned activities undertaken by two individuals with the intention of fostering a romantic relationship. This includes, but is not limited to, the cost of meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts.\n- **Shared Equally:** Dividing the total dating expenses such that each partner contributes 50% of the total cost, either through direct payment or an agreed-upon equivalent contribution.\n\nOur judging criteria is promoting equitable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their model for managing dating expenses fosters equity, mutual respect, and healthy communication within a romantic partnership should win the debate.\n\nFirst, equal sharing of expenses fosters gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles. Traditional dating etiquette often dictated that men should bear the financial burden, reinforcing outdated gender stereotypes [1]. However, a majority of Americans now agree with statements measuring beliefs in gender equality [2]. Sharing costs equally promotes gender equality, ensuring both partners contribute and have equal autonomy. According to Mashable, splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date, regardless of gender, have equal autonomy [3]. This shift reflects a move towards more egalitarian relationships where financial contributions are not dictated by gender. Therefore, by promoting gender equality, equal sharing of expenses lays the foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nSecond, equal sharing of expenses promotes open communication and reduces financial stress. A survey indicates that couples, on average, discuss finances around five months into the relationship [4]. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. When both partners are transparent about their finances and expectations, it reduces the potential for misunderstandings and resentment. As The Money Engineers point out, if one partner earns significantly more than the other and covers most of the shared expenses, it could potentially create an imbalance of power [6]. Therefore, by encouraging open communication and preventing financial imbalances, equal sharing of expenses contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship.\n\nThird, equal sharing of expenses creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership. When both partners contribute financially, it reduces the potential for power imbalances and fosters a sense of mutual respect. As Black Girl Nerds mentions, splitting expenses can allow financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. This balance contributes to a healthier and more sustainable relationship in the long run. A relationship where finances are discussed openly and shared equitably fosters mutual respect and a stronger partnership [7]. Therefore, by reducing power imbalances and fostering mutual respect, equal sharing of expenses creates a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\nIn conclusion, dating expenses should be shared equally between partners because it fosters gender equality, promotes open communication, and creates a foundation for a more balanced and respectful partnership.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.

        "statement": "My opponents advocate for the equal sharing of dating expenses to foster equitable relationships. However, we believe that a strictly equal approach is not only flawed but can actually undermine the very equity it seeks to achieve. Their definitions, while seemingly reasonable, oversimplify the complexities of modern relationships. Their notion of 'shared equally' as a rigid 50/50 split neglects the nuances of individual circumstances. A more flexible approach is needed.\n\nThe crux of their argument rests on the assumption that equal financial contribution automatically translates to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships. However, this is a false equivalency. While financial transparency is important, mandating an equal split doesn't guarantee these outcomes. Couples can communicate effectively and maintain mutual respect regardless of how expenses are divided. As demonstrated by *a 2024 study conducted by the American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 56% of couples argued about money more than any other topic [1]. This shows that simply splitting expenses equally does not eliminate financial stress or guarantee better communication.\n\nIn fact, a strictly equal approach can be detrimental. Consider this: An insistence on strictly equal splitting disregards the inherent variations in individual financial capacities. A student with limited income should not be expected to contribute the same amount as a working professional. This creates an unfair burden and can lead to resentment, a clear contradiction to their goal of fostering equity. As *Tu, who worked at J.P. Morgan and Buzzfeed before pursuing her own business*, argued in 2023, splitting expenses evenly can lead to resentment in relationships with significant income disparities because the lower-earning partner is often forced to live beyond their means or sacrifice their financial independence [2]. We are promoting true equity and they are forcing a potentially detrimental system.\n\nFurthermore, enforcing an equal split undermines the intrinsic value of non-monetary contributions within a partnership. One partner might contribute more in terms of emotional support, household chores, or career sacrifices. These contributions are valuable and should be considered, not ignored by a rigid financial arrangement. Are we really saying that hours spent cooking a meal is worth nothing? Their framework focuses solely on the financial aspect, disregarding other crucial contributions. As highlighted in *an article about overcoming financial inequalities*, financial contributions are just one of many ways an individual can bring value to a relationship, and understanding and recognizing non-financial contributions can help both partners [3].\n\nFinally, the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances in the relationship. If one partner is pressured to spend equally despite not being able to afford it, this can create a subtle form of control and dependence. We acknowledge that in certain situations and in certain relationship structures, one party contributes far less financially than the other, but that should not serve as an excuse to force a blanket rule to split 50/50. According to *Robert K\u00f6rner and Astrid Sch\u00fctz in 2021*, socioeconomic resources such as income, occupational status, and educational attainment can influence one\u2019s partner, which is usually termed positional power [4].\n\nTherefore, we argue that a more nuanced and flexible approach, one that considers individual circumstances and values all forms of contribution, is essential for fostering truly equitable and healthy relationships. We are not against fairness; we simply believe that equality does not always equate to equity.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] Love and Money: How Financial Stress Affects Relationships. *American Association of Marriage and Family Therapy*, 2024.\n[2] Tu.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their mischaracterization of our definition, their misunderstanding of the relationship between financial contributions and equality, their downplaying of the importance of financial equity in dating, and their misconstrual of potential power dynamics. By addressing these flaws, we will demonstrate how our model fosters more equitable relationships.\n\nFirst, the opposition attempts to portray our definition of \"shared equally\" as a rigid, inflexible 50/50 split, ignoring the nuances of modern relationships; however, we never claimed it was an inflexible mandate. Our definition aims for a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a baseline for equitable contribution. This is not a rigid mandate, but rather a commitment to equality, acknowledging that open communication and mutual agreement can lead to adjustments based on individual circumstances. It's about the *intention* of equality, not necessarily rigid adherence to the number. This promotes equity while providing structure that their vague, \"flexible\" approach lacks. Their approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes. Therefore, maintaining our definition strengthens the basis of our equitable relationship.\n\nSecond, they claim that equal financial contribution doesn't automatically translate to gender equality, open communication, and balanced partnerships, citing a study that 56% of couples argue about money [1]. However, it's a straw man fallacy to say that we believe it *automatically* translates to these things. We argue that it *fosters* these positive outcomes. Furthermore, all disagreements are bad for relationships. Even if couples disagree about money, that doesn't mean it's worse than other topics to disagree on. In fact, regularly discussing shared expenses helps to foster open, ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems [5]. This aligns with the finding that couples who have similar spending habits, savings goals, and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship [6]. Thus, our model encourages healthier communication patterns compared to the opposition's, which lacks a proactive approach to financial discussions.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a strictly equal split disregards variations in individual financial capacities and can lead to resentment, citing Tu (2023). However, *any* financial arrangement can lead to resentment if not discussed openly and agreed upon. That\u2019s why our definition allows for adjustments as long as both parties are communicating. It is crucial to ensure financial independence, so if dynamics ever shift, one person isn\u2019t solely reliant on their partner [7]. The negative's \"flexible\" approach lacks structure and is *more* prone to inequity without a baseline to work from. Ultimately, open communication and a commitment to finding a fair balance are essential for a healthy relationship [4]. This focus on open communication about the intention of equal independence makes our argument stronger than the status quo.\n\nFinally, the negative argues that the emphasis on equal spending can create a false sense of equality, masking underlying power imbalances, citing K\u00f6rner and Sch\u00fctz (2021). However, our model is meant to prevent this! The *intention* of the 50/50 split is to *address* potential power imbalances, not mask them. By having open conversations about finances, couples are more likely to identify and address underlying issues. In relationships, when couples contribute, this allows them to focus on enjoying the experience without worrying about one person footing the bill all the time and the dynamic that creates in your relationship [7].

        "statement": "Chairperson, esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, my opponents are attempting to build a house on a shaky foundation. The real question isn't whether fairness is a good thing, but whether a rigid 50/50 split of dating expenses actually gets us there. As I'll demonstrate, it falls short.\n\nFirst, let's examine their idea of \"shared equally.\" They suggest the 50/50 split is a flexible aim. However, their entire argument rests on achieving equality through strictly equal contributions. This very definition forces a potentially awkward and biased conversation about finances. This demand for a split implies that equality is the starting point, not the result of a nuanced discussion. It creates an implicit pressure, contradicting the intention of open and unbiased financial discussions.\n\nSecond, they argue that equal sharing promotes gender equality. Now, we never claimed that equal contributions *automatically* lead to equality. However, their emphasis on a rigid 50/50 split implies that financial contributions are the primary driver of equitable relationships. This provides only a facade of gender equality while neglecting crucial aspects of social change. By prioritizing a strict financial split, we risk devaluing non-monetary contributions, creating an incomplete picture of a balanced and supportive partnership. For example, who is taking care of the house chores? Who is planning the dates? These are all contributions that should be valued.\n\nThird, their argument that equal sharing promotes open communication is flawed. They assume that splitting the bill equally eliminates financial stress. But did you know that even when couples split expenses 50/50, a significant number still argue about money? In fact, *radcoaches, a financial coach and happy couple of over 10 years*, found that couples who focus heavily on equal financial contributions also tend to have other negative money habits that hurt the relationship. This statistic highlights that equal division is not a cure-all for financial disagreements. Transparency stems from commitment, not mandated splitting! This undermines their claim of healthier communication.\n\nFourth, the intention of the 50/50 split is to address potential power imbalances, not mask them, by encouraging financial transparency. But simply having these conversations does not solve the problem. We disagree! Pressuring a partner to spend equally can backfire, creating subtle control, and undermining equity, not solidifying it. As *Healthline* reports, emotional manipulation in relationships can take many forms, including financial control. This can manifest as pressuring a partner to spend beyond their means or using financial contributions as leverage in disagreements.\n\nFinally, and perhaps most importantly, remember what a 50/50 expectation means in practice. The expectation of equal financial contributions can place undue strain on individuals with limited financial resources. It\u2019s unfair to impose a financial burden that compromises their ability to save, invest in their future, or even meet their basic needs. As *Psychology Today* reported in their article \"Financial Strain and Relationship Health,\" financial strain can lead to increased depressive symptoms and less satisfaction in the relationship. Therefore, financial instability can lead to a vicious cycle that can take a toll on the relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the intention behind equal sharing may be admirable, the approach oversimplifies and can be damaging. Focusing solely on financial contributions misses the big picture. For true equity, we need to value all contributions.\n\n**Reference**\n1.

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around establishing equitable relationships through the sharing of dating expenses.\n\nThe core of the opposition's argument is that our proposal for a 50/50 split is too rigid. However, we propose a 50/50 split as a *goal*, a *framework* for initiating open and honest conversations about finances. It's a commitment to equality, acknowledging that adjustments can\u2014and should\u2014be made based on individual circumstances [1]. Their \"flexible\" approach offers no guidance, potentially leading to greater inequity and disputes.\n\nThey also claim that focusing on a 50/50 split creates a \"facade of gender equality,\" neglecting non-monetary contributions. We agree those contributions are valuable! However, unlike financial contributions, those are subjective and harder to quantify. Without a clear financial baseline, these non-monetary contributions can be easily exploited, leading to real power imbalances [2].\n\nThe opposition argues that even when couples split expenses 50/50, they still argue about money. Again, we never claimed splitting 50/50 *eliminates* disagreements! But it *fosters* healthier communication by providing a structure for discussing finances openly and regularly [3]. It encourages a *proactive* approach to financial discussions.\n\nUltimately, our model isn't about rigid numbers; it's about fairness, respect, and autonomy. We believe our side provides the fairest approach because it promotes equal contribution and reduces the potential for one partner to be financially burdened or taken advantage of [4].\n\nTherefore, we urge you to affirm: dating expenses *should* be shared equally, as a framework for an equitable relationship.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Swipewise.dating.
