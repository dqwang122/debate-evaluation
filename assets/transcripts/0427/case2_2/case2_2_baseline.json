      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that financial literacy should be a required course in school. We define financial literacy as the understanding of how money works in the world, encompassing the ability to make informed decisions about saving, investing, borrowing, and managing finances effectively [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is societal well-being. We contend that requiring financial literacy courses enhances societal well-being by empowering individuals to make sound financial decisions, leading to reduced debt, increased savings, and greater financial stability. A financially literate society benefits from increased economic activity, reduced reliance on social safety nets, and an improved overall quality of life.\n\nFirst, requiring financial literacy courses promotes responsible financial behavior. These courses equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed financial decisions, such as budgeting, saving, and avoiding predatory loans [2]. Edutopia.org reported in 2023 that financial literacy lessons have an \"overwhelmingly\" positive impact on students\u2019 future financial habits [2]. Furthermore, students with financial literacy education enter college with a better understanding of how their loans work, preventing potential debt crises [1]. This proactive approach to financial management reduces the risk of financial hardship and fosters long-term stability.\n\nSecond, implementing required financial literacy courses has the potential to reduce economic inequality. By providing individuals from all socioeconomic backgrounds with the tools to build wealth and achieve financial security, we can bridge the wealth gap. It's crucial to note that only 1 in 20 students in schools where more than 75% of students are eligible for free or reduced-price meals have access to financial education courses [3]. Ensuring that all young individuals have exposure to financial literacy is a vital step in closing inequality gaps and providing the skills and resources to improve their lives overall, as emphasized by the California Department of Education [4].\n\nThird, mandating financial literacy prepares students for the real world. Traditional education often neglects practical life skills such as financial management. A required financial literacy course fills this gap, preparing students for the financial challenges and opportunities they will face as adults. This includes understanding concepts like taxes, insurance, investing, and retirement planning [5]. According to a report by Ramsey Solutions, financial literacy should be taught in schools, teaching young students to save a \\$500 emergency fund [5]. As the global economy evolves and individuals face increasingly complex financial choices, these skills are more critical than ever [6].\n\nIn conclusion, requiring financial literacy courses in schools is essential for promoting responsible financial behavior, reducing economic inequality, and preparing students for the real world. By prioritizing financial literacy, we invest in a future where individuals are empowered to make informed decisions, leading to greater financial stability and societal well-being.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Should Schools Teach Financial Literacy Classes?.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that mandating financial literacy as a required course in school is not the most effective approach to improving students' financial well-being. We define financial literacy as the ability to understand and effectively use various financial skills, including personal financial management, budgeting, and investing.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing educational efficacy. The optimal educational policy should prioritize subjects and teaching methods that provide the greatest long-term benefit to students, considering both cognitive development and real-world preparedness, while minimizing wasted resources and curriculum overload.\n\nFirst, mandatory financial literacy education is ineffective at changing long-term financial behavior. While the intention is noble, studies consistently show minimal long-term impact on students' financial habits. A much-cited paper published in the journal *Management Science* found that almost everyone who took a financial literacy class forgot what they learned within 20 months, and that financial literacy has a \"negligible\" impact on future behavior [1]. This suggests that the knowledge gained in these courses doesn't translate into real-world application. As *The Washington Post* points out, \"study after study shows that financial-literacy courses don't change behavior\" [2]. This ineffectiveness directly contradicts our judging criteria, as resources spent on an ineffective course are wasted and could be better allocated to subjects with more demonstrable long-term benefits.\n\nSecond, mandatory financial literacy creates curriculum overload and significant opportunity costs. Integrating new subjects into an already packed curriculum poses a significant challenge [8]. Requiring financial literacy forces schools to cut back on other potentially more valuable subjects due to limited instructional time. As reported by *RNZ*, principals are wary of the curriculum overload that financial literacy policies can create [8]. The opportunity cost of this trade-off may outweigh the perceived benefits. For example, increased focus on STEM subjects or enhanced reading and writing programs may provide a more substantial foundation for future success. By diverting resources to a potentially ineffective mandatory course, we risk diminishing the quality of education in other critical areas, undermining the goal of maximizing educational efficacy.\n\nThird, alternative methods of financial education are more flexible and potentially more effective. Rather than a one-size-fits-all mandatory course, integrating financial concepts into existing subjects like math and social studies or providing access to online tools and community-based programs can offer a more personalized and engaging learning experience. The National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) highlights that stand-alone personal finance courses, online tools, and community-based initiatives are alternatives to traditional financial literacy education in schools [4]. Furthermore, many financial institutions offer free educational materials and presentations specifically designed for classrooms [4]. These alternatives avoid the pitfalls of a rigid, mandatory course and allow for more adaptable and relevant instruction, better aligning with the goal of maximizing educational efficacy.\n\nIn conclusion, while financial literacy is undoubtedly important, mandating it as a required course is not the most effective way to achieve widespread financial competence. The lack of long-term behavioral change, the creation of curriculum overload, and the availability of more flexible alternatives all argue against this approach. We urge you to consider the opportunity costs and embrace more effective solutions that truly maximize educational efficacy.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) NPR.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three main flaws, which are their chosen judging criterion, the ineffectiveness of financial literacy education, and curriculum overload.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues for \"maximizing educational efficacy\" as the judging criterion, but we contend that the *financial well-being* of students is paramount. [Explanation] While educational efficacy is important, it's short-sighted to ignore the very real financial challenges students will face upon graduation. [Rebuttal] Can we truly say we are preparing students for the future if they excel in STEM but lack the basic knowledge to manage their finances, avoid debt traps, and invest wisely? Furthermore, focusing on educational efficacy and *rejecting* the premise that financial literacy can also lead to it is a false dilemma. Studies show that financial literacy education has a positive impact, increasing student knowledge [4]. In fact, students enter college with a better understanding of how their loans work because of financial literacy [1]. [Impact] Therefore, we urge you to prioritize the long-term financial well-being of students, as it is a fundamental aspect of their overall success and directly influences our initial utilitarian framework.\n\nSecond, the negative claims financial literacy education is ineffective. They cite studies suggesting minimal long-term impact [Explanation]. However, we argue this is a hasty generalization based on cherry-picked data. [Rebuttal] The *Edutopia* report from 2023 details that financial literacy lessons have an \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d positive impact on students\u2019 future financial habits, from budgeting and saving to avoiding predatory loans [2]. Further research indicates that the benefits of high school finance lessons are still detectable 12 years after graduation, improving savings and loan repayment speeds [5]. Moreover, studies show students with access to high-quality financial education experience better financial outcomes as adults with less debt and a higher quality of life [1, 4]. [Impact] We level the playing field by showing the positive benefits to further prove the usefulness of our required curriculum.\n\nThird, our opponents argue that mandatory financial literacy leads to curriculum overload, forcing schools to cut back on other potentially valuable subjects [Explanation]. We believe this presents a false dilemma, suggesting it is impossible to integrate financial literacy without sacrificing other essential areas [Rebuttal]. In reality, financial concepts can be effectively integrated into existing subjects like math and social studies, providing real-world applications for these lessons [7]. For example, math classes can incorporate budgeting exercises, while social studies courses can explore the history of financial systems. The importance of financial literacy far outweighs the short-term time commitment when compared to the alternative: a lifetime of financial struggle. [Impact] By efficiently integrating financial literacy, we not only equip students with essential skills but also enhance their understanding of other subjects, leading to greater educational efficacy overall.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Forbes.

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments contain several flaws, namely in their defense of their judging criterion, their dismissal of the ineffectiveness of financial literacy courses, their downplaying of curriculum overload, and their \"shield\" argument against predatory lending.\n\nFirst, they attack our judging criterion of maximizing educational efficacy, but this is a misdirection. They argue that financial well-being is the ultimate goal, but we contend that a well-rounded education, which maximizes cognitive development and real-world preparedness, is the foundation upon which long-term financial success is built. Educational efficacy encompasses much more than just financial well-being, it includes critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability, all of which are crucial for navigating the complexities of the modern world. A strong education is the key to unlocking better job opportunities and higher earning potential, leading to greater financial well-being in the long run. For example, graduates with bachelor's degrees earn significantly more than those with only a high school diploma [1]. Therefore, focusing on maximizing educational efficacy is not an abstract exercise, but a concrete strategy for ensuring our students' future financial success.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that \"some knowledge is better than none\" and uses the analogy of first aid training. However, this analogy is flawed. First aid teaches immediately applicable skills that are regularly reinforced in real-life situations, while financial literacy courses, as proven by research, are quickly forgotten and have a negligible impact on behavior. A study published in the journal *Management Science* found that financial literacy has a \"negligible\" impact on future behavior, with students forgetting what they learned within 20 months [2]. Unlike first aid, the skills taught in financial literacy courses require constant practice and reinforcement to be effective, which is often lacking in a mandatory curriculum. We are not arguing that basic financial knowledge is useless, but we maintain that mandatory courses are not the only or the best way to deliver this knowledge. There are more effective alternative ways [3].\n\nThird, they downplay the issue of curriculum overload and the significant opportunity costs it creates. Every hour spent on a mandatory financial literacy course is an hour *not* spent on other subjects that may be more valuable in the long run. We should be prioritizing subjects like STEM, writing, and critical thinking, which provide a more substantial foundation for future career prospects and adaptability. Integrating financial concepts into existing subjects is a *better* approach, because it avoids curriculum overload and makes the learning more relevant. As reported by *RNZ*, principals are wary of the curriculum overload that financial literacy policies can create [4].\n\nFinally, they present financial literacy education as a \"shield\" against predatory lending and scams. While we acknowledge the risk of these dangers, we believe that these problems are more effectively addressed through regulation and enforcement, rather than mandatory education alone. These problems are caused by an intent to mislead or swindle, and even financially literate individuals can fall victim to scams. Our government needs to provide increased consumer protection laws, and we need to focus on building critical thinking skills and awareness of common scam tactics.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Education Times.
