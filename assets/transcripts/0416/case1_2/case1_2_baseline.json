We define an ai tutor as an artificial intelligence powered system. That provides personalized instruction feedback and support to students adapting to their individual learning needs and pace. Are judging criteria is maximising educational outcomes for all students the side that demonstrates the greatest potential for improving learning outcomes increasing accessibility to quality education and supporting both student and teacher needs should win this debate. Ai tutors provide personalized learning experiences. Leading to improved student outcomes. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all approaches ai tutors can adapt to individual student needs learning styles and paces. Offering tailored instruction and targeted feedback. This personalization leads to improved student engagement motivation and overall academic performance. For example a study from harvard currently under peer review found that students given access to an ai tutor designed using pedagogical principles doubled their learning gains in less time than traditional methods. Furthermore platforms like khan academies conmigo powered by open ais gpt for offer personalized assistance for only $4 a month demonstrating the feasibility and accessibility of personalized ai tutoring. By catering to individual learning preferences and providing immediate support. Ai tutors create a more effective and engaging learning environment. Ultimately boosting student achievement. Second. Ai tutors enhance accessibility and equity in education. Geographical and economic barriers often limit access to quality educational resources. Ai tudors break down these barriers by providing affordable 24/7 access to personalized learning. This is particularly crucial for students in underserved communities or those with diverse learning needs. Newark research highlights that infusing ai into high-dose tutoring breaks down geographical and economic barriers. In a random trial of 1800 k-12 students from underserved communities students whose tutors use the ai app tutor co-pilot for 4 percentage points more likely to master mathematics topics than students whose tutors did not have access to the app. Ai tutors level the playing field ensuring that all students regardless of their background have access to the resources they need to succeed. Third ai tutors and power teachers by providing data-driven insights and reducing administrative burr. Teachers are often overwhelmed with administrative tasks limiting the time they can dedicate to personalized instruction and student interaction. Ai tutors automate routine tasks such as grading and progress tracking. Freeing up teacher's time to focus on what they do best teaching inspiring. And connecting with students. Moreover ai systems can provide teachers with data-driven insights into student performance. Emotions and engagement levels enabling them to tailor their teaching methods and approaches or provide assistance or intervention accordingly. This dynamic interaction streamlines the teaching process and fosters a more effective and adaptive pedagogical approach. By supporting teachers with valuable data and reducing their workload. Ai tutors create a more efficient and effective learning environment for everyone. In conclusion ai tutors are not a replacement for teachers but rather a powerful tool to enhance and personalize education. By improving learning outcomes increasing accessibility and supporting teachers ai tutors offer a promising path. Towards maximizing educational outcomes for all students.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the widespread adoption of AI tutors in the classroom is premature and detrimental to holistic student development. We define an AI Tutor as an artificial intelligence-powered system designed to provide personalized instruction, feedback, and support to students, often through adaptive learning platforms and automated assessment tools.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing holistic student development. We contend that the optimal educational environment fosters not only academic achievement but also crucial social-emotional skills, critical thinking abilities, and ethical reasoning. We believe that introducing AI Tutors into classrooms undermines this holistic development.\n\nFirst, AI tutors hinder social-emotional development. Education is more than the simple diffusion of knowledge; it also includes human interaction and emotional support [2]. Relying more and more on AI may reduce teacher-to-student interactions and relationships and take away from the social-emotional aspects of learning [4]. If those interactions diminish, students\u2019 social skills and interpersonal development will suffer [4]. As humans, traditional tutors can provide real-time feedback and personalized interaction [4]. AI-driven personalized training benefits educators who have overwhelming responsibilities, but it could potentially lead to fewer teachers in the classroom [7]. Therefore, the lack of human connection can lead to a negative impact on student success and well-being [2]. AI tutors lack human touch and emotional support [1]. Studies show that education also includes human interaction, emotional support, as well as acquiring social skills\u2014all of which are lacking in AI [4]. That is way beyond the scope of what an AI can provide through only intelligence [4].\n\nSecond, AI Tutors impair critical thinking and problem-solving abilities. Over-reliance on AI can negatively impact critical and analytical thinking abilities, as students may become less adept at independently analyzing information, forming logical arguments, and making well-reasoned decisions [3]. The convenience of AI-generated answers might deter students from engaging in thorough research and critical evaluation of sources, which are crucial for developing robust cognitive skills [3]. As Koos & Wachsmann noted in 2023, the increasing reliance on AI in education can lead to technology overdependence, which may have several unintended consequences [3]. For instance, students may become overly reliant on AI tutoring systems to solve problems or complete tasks, reducing their ability or motivation to think critically and independently [1]. The influence of artificial intelligence (AI) in education offers both significant benefits for teachers and drawbacks for student learning [3].\n\nThird, AI Tutors raise ethical concerns regarding data privacy and bias. AI tutors collect student data, raising privacy concerns [8]. Strict data protection measures are essential [8]. As AI tutors collect vast amounts of sensitive student information, it raises concerns regarding data privacy and security [4]. The data includes what students are doing, when they're doing it, and how they're doing it [8]. Ensuring the security and privacy of this data is critical to maintaining trust and compliance with regulations such as GDPR [8]. Furthermore, AI can unintentionally perpetuate biases, limit teacher roles, and widen access disparities, highlighting the need for cautious, equitable, and balanced implementation to ensure that AI complements traditional teaching without compromising student learning [7]. Therefore, ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and equity remain significant challenges [5].\n\nIn conclusion, while AI tutors offer potential benefits, their limitations concerning social-emotional development, critical thinking skills, and ethical considerations outweigh their advantages. We urge you to oppose the widespread adoption of AI tutors in the classroom \n\n**Reference**\n(1) Illinois.edu. 2024. AI in schools \u2013 Pros and Cons.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments contain three critical flaws: they misunderstand the role of AI in social-emotional development, misrepresent the impact of AI on critical thinking, and exaggerate the ethical concerns surrounding data privacy.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI tutors hinder social-emotional development by reducing human interaction. However, this argument overlooks the crucial fact that AI tutors are designed to *augment*, not replace, human teachers [14]. As *Education Week* reports, teachers spend up to 29 hours a week on non-teaching tasks [2]. By automating these routine administrative duties and delivering personalized instruction, AI frees up teachers to focus on what they do best: fostering meaningful relationships with their students, understanding how students feel, and nurturing their emotional and social growth. The result is not a decrease in human interaction, but an *increase* in its quality and impact [9].\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that AI impairs critical thinking and problem-solving abilities, suggesting students will become overly reliant on AI-generated answers [3]. This argument commits a slippery slope fallacy. In reality, AI tutors can be powerful tools for developing critical thinking skills. AI can present students with complex problems, adapt the difficulty level to their individual needs, and provide personalized feedback that encourages them to justify their reasoning. Moreover, studies show that AI tutors excel in personalized learning, adapting the pace and depth of content to suit individual learners [4, 11]. This flexibility allows students to focus on areas where they need the most help, providing targeted feedback and extra practice when required. AI systems can also provide teachers with data-driven insights into student performance, emotions, and engagement levels, enabling them to tailor their teaching methods and approaches or provide assistance or intervention accordingly [10, 15].\n\nThird, the opposition raises ethical concerns regarding data privacy and bias. While these concerns are valid, they are manageable and do not outweigh the significant benefits of AI tutors. Existing data protection regulations like GDPR provide a strong framework for addressing privacy concerns. Furthermore, AI can actually be used to identify and mitigate biases in educational content, ensuring a more equitable and inclusive learning environment for all students [5]. Therefore, ethical concerns such as privacy, bias, and equity remain significant challenges [5]. A balanced approach is required to ensure that AI complements traditional teaching without compromising student learning [7].\n\nIn conclusion, we firmly believe that integrating AI tutors into the classroom is an indispensable step toward maximizing student outcomes and constructing a brighter future for education [3, 8].\n\n**Reference**\n(1) \"The Role of AI in Education - Benefits, Use Cases & Examples.\" Benefits, Use Cases & Examples, January 25, 2025.\n(2) \"Here's How Teachers Are Using AI to Save Time - Education Week.\" *Education Week*.\n(3) Schultz, Brooke. \"The New Teachers' Aides: AI Tutors.\" *Education Week*, February 14, 2025.\n(4) AI tutors excelled in personalized learning, adapting the pace and depth of content to suit individual learners.

However, even with integrated AI, the *quality* of human interaction is diminished [4]. Teachers transition from mentors to supervisors of AI, reducing meaningful connections. What\u2019s more, districts may be tempted to reduce teaching staff to save costs. The result is a net negative impact on social-emotional development, as students miss out on vital opportunities to learn empathy and navigate complex social situations [2]. Studies show that activities like role-playing, group discussions, and even simple \"I-messages\" are essential for developing these crucial skills [1].\n\nSecond, while the affirmative argues AI can personalize learning and provide instant feedback, they miss a crucial point. The *convenience* of readily available answers discourages students from developing independent critical thinking skills [3]. Students may become less adept at independently analyzing information, forming logical arguments, and making well-reasoned decisions [3]. Rather than fostering deep understanding, AI tutors can encourage a focus on memorization over comprehension, emphasizing formulas instead of conceptual understanding [6]. This ultimately undermines the development of true problem-solving abilities.\n\nThird, the opposition dismisses our ethical concerns regarding data privacy and bias, touting anonymization and audits. However, these measures are insufficient. The affirmative ignores a crucial point: AI collects students' information and threatens their privacy [8]. Anonymization is never foolproof, and the sheer volume of data collected still creates a risk of re-identification [8]. In fact, AI tutors increase the risks to data and create larger data sets that can be hacked. Further, the affirmative's argument that \"two wrongs make a right\"\u2014suggesting AI bias is acceptable because human bias exists\u2014is a logical fallacy. Algorithmic bias perpetuates existing inequities at scale [4]. While inherent biases in teachers are often known, the bias exhibited by AI is much harder for students to identify, giving it more power to negatively influence outcomes [4]. \n\nFor these reasons, we maintain that the widespread adoption of AI tutors is premature and detrimental to holistic student development.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-way-for-youngsters-to-engage-in-social-and-emotional-learning-through-games\n(2) Waldenu.edu. 2024.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around maximizing student outcomes through the strategic integration of AI tutors.\n\nOn the first battleground, the impact on socio-emotional development, we demonstrated that AI augments teachers, enabling them to focus on personalized learning and support. Instead of reducing meaningful connections, AI can identify students needing extra support, allowing teachers to intervene more effectively [9]. Teachers can leverage AI insights to adjust their instruction and create adaptive learning experiences [10]. Budget cuts stemming from AI implementation are not a foregone conclusion. Responsible implementation, training, and monitoring can mitigate any potential risk of reduced interaction. \n\nTurning to the impact on critical thinking and problem-solving, we showed that AI fosters these skills by facilitating personalized prompts and feedback. AI tutors provide instant feedback and context, aiding comprehension, as *Education Week* reported [3]. AI can be a tool for writing and higher-order thinking skills. The convenience of AI is not a crutch; with proper educator guidance, it becomes a springboard for deeper understanding.\n\nFinally, regarding ethical concerns, we acknowledge the need for robust data protection, committing to regular audits and the creation of fair algorithms. Unlike human biases which are often implicit and hard to address, AI bias can be proactively identified and rectified. We can ensure student privacy and correct biases in traditional teaching materials by integrating AI [15]. \n\nThe essence of this debate comes down to opportunity. By strategically integrating AI tutors, we are creating an opportunity for students to achieve their full potential and for teachers to focus on what they do best.
