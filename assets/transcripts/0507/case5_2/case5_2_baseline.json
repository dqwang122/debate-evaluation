We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "stage": "opening",
      "side": "against",
      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define \"decline\" as a demonstrable reduction in the quality, originality, and impact of human artistic expression [Oxford English Dictionary]. \"Human Creative Arts\" are artistic endeavors originating from human ingenuity, emotional expression, and intellectual thought, encompassing various forms such as visual arts, literature, music, and performing arts. \"AI\" refers to computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence [Merriam-Webster].\nOur judging criteria is the preservation of human artistic value. The side that best demonstrates the preservation and continued evolution of core human values within creative arts should win the debate.\n\nFirst, AI lacks the emotional depth and originality essential for true artistic expression. AI's creative output is fundamentally limited by its reliance on algorithms and data. AI can generate art based on patterns and data it has learned from existing artworks, but it lacks true creativity [4]. Human creativity, in contrast, involves genuine emotions, unique perspectives, and deliberate choices [2]. As Digital Brew notes, AI art lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity [1]. This means that while AI can mimic creativity, it cannot replicate the deeply personal and emotionally resonant art that humans are capable of creating. Because a lack of depth equates to a degradation of art from a human perspective, the inability of AI to produce emotion makes the decline of human creative art unlikely.\n\nSecond, AI serves primarily as a tool to augment, not replace, human creativity. The majority of artists view AI more as a tool to enhance human creativity rather than a substitute [3]. Al-Ghamdi affirmed that AI is not a substitute for human creativity, but a tool that can enrich this creativity if used properly [3]. Many artists are using AI to augment their creative process, generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects [3]. For example, AI can assist with rapid iteration and creation of images, which human artists can then refine with their vision and personal touch [6]. This collaborative approach allows artists to leverage AI's capabilities while retaining their unique artistic vision and control. Therefore, because tools generally improve the value of a craft and help it evolve, it is unlikely that AI will cause the decline of human creative art.\n\nThird, ethical and legal concerns surrounding AI art limit its potential to dominate the creative landscape. Copyright issues, lack of consent for training data, and potential job displacement raise significant ethical concerns that hinder the widespread adoption and acceptance of AI-generated art [4]. As AaronHall.com reports, AI art copyright issues involve disputes over ownership and infringement, with no clear legal framework [5]. The plaintiffs in a recent case, Karla Ortiz, Kelley McKernan, and Sarah Andersen, alleged that AI art generators used their original artworks without permission to train AI systems [5]. These concerns will likely lead to increased regulation and oversight, further limiting AI's potential to replace human artists. Therefore, because legal and ethical issues will ensure the preservation of human artistic value, the decline of human creative art is unlikely.\n\nIn conclusion, because AI lacks emotional depth, serves as an assistive tool, and faces ethical limitations, we firmly believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We urge you to uphold the preservation of human artistic value.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed \"enhancement\" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes [2] reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature [3] also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz [12] have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed \"benefit\" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.\n\nSecond, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick [11] has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI [6]. Illustrators like Karla Ortiz [12] rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for \"prompt engineering\" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com [9] suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex [8] stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians [4].\n\nFinally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent \n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "stage": "rebuttal",
      "side": "against",
      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several mischaracterizations and overlooks key aspects of AI's impact on the artistic landscape. They cling to a narrow view of \"preservation\" while ignoring the transformative benefits and the natural evolution of art itself. We will address their core arguments concerning devaluation, copyright, job losses, and originality, reframing this debate around *evolution* and *expansion* rather than simple preservation.\n\nFirst, the affirmative claims AI devalues human skill, flooding the market and displacing artists. They judge based on a desire to \"preserve\" the status quo. However, they fail to recognize that technological advancements have *always* reshaped artistic skillsets. Just as photography didn't destroy painting, AI isn't destroying art; it's *evolving* it. To cling to the idea of \"preservation\" is to stifle artistic growth and ignore the opportunities presented by new tools. The demand isn't disappearing; it's shifting. Instead of pure technical skill, the need for creative direction, prompt engineering, and AI-assisted artistry is growing. [3] As one article notes, AI is not a substitute for human creativity, but a tool that can enrich it if used properly [3]. We see this as an opportunity to augment artistic abilities. The affirmative ignores that human creativity often reinterprets AI-generated art, blending it with unique human vision and emotion, surpassing AI's limitations. AI is providing tools to allow creativity to expand and express.\n\nSecond, our opponents raise copyright and ethical concerns, citing legal challenges and the unauthorized use of artists' work. However, this ignores the dynamic nature of copyright law. Copyright law has adapted to new technologies like digital music and film, and it *will* adapt to AI. To suggest that copyright law is immutable is to ignore history. The legal battles they cite are ongoing, not settled law. *Most claims in AI art copyright lawsuits have been dismissed* [5]. Furthermore, the very idea of originality in art is complex; human artists have always drawn inspiration from existing works. The line between inspiration and theft is often blurry, and AI simply introduces a new form of inspiration and remixing.\n\nThird, the affirmative argues that AI reduces opportunities for artists, leading to job losses. However, they neglect the *new* opportunities AI creates. The rise of prompt engineering, AI art curation, and AI-assisted art all create avenues for artists to thrive. While some traditional roles may diminish, AI democratizes art creation, allowing *more* people to engage with art, create art, and consume art. A study indicates the majority of people appreciate AI art, indicating an overall positive perception [7]. AI allows for new art forms and the removal of gate keepers.\n\nFinally, our opponents bemoan the loss of originality, ignoring that all art builds upon what came before. AI is simply another tool for remixing and reinterpreting existing ideas, allowing for novel art forms previously impossible. The human vision is what sets this work apart and what makes it unique and valuable.\n\nThe question we must ask ourselves: Is it ethical to restrict access to such a powerful tool? If AI empowers more people to create art and enriches society, is it right to limit its use in the name of \"preserving\" a select few? We believe that the evolution of art, even if disruptive, ultimately benefits society as a whole, expanding artistic expression in ways never before imagined.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income.

But this argument misses the crucial point. Ai amplifies human artistic abilities fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. As ai artist org reported in their 2024 article ai tools enhance artist workflows enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced. It is being transformed and augmented by ai. Leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration. Now let's talk about jobs. Are opponents argue ai leads to job displacement but this ignores the new opportunities it creates. The school of the art institute of chicago reported that the fusion of humans with ai-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft. Or have time for better research. This isn't about replacement. It's about evolution. According to the ai in art market size share trends report 78% of artists believe that ai will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts. Finally while copyright an ethical concerns are valid they are not insurmountable. Copyright laws are adaptable. And will evolve to accommodate ai generated art. Fostering rather than stifling creativity. A recent medium article highlights how artists can choose licensing models that align with their preferences and goals. Maintaining control over their creations while promoting collaboration. In short ai doesn't spell the end of human creativity. It opens up new chapters. It empowers artists fosters innovation and expands the boundaries of art itself.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) The Impact of AI on Modern Art: How Technology is Shaping Creativity. *AIArtists.org*, 2024.\n(2) AI's impact on art | News. *School of the Art Institute of Chicago*, 2024.\n(3) AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the. *AIArtists.org*, 2023.\n(4) Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a. *Medium*, 2024.\n\n\n```"
