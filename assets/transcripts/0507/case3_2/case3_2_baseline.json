      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

      "side": "against",
      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency (CBDC). A CBDC is defined as a digital form of central bank-issued money, distinct from commercial bank money and physical cash, that serves as legal tender and a direct liability of the central bank [9]. We believe the judging criteria for this debate should be based on which side best promotes financial stability and protects individual liberties.\n\nFirst, CBDCs pose a significant threat to individual financial privacy and liberty. The Cato Institute highlights that CBDCs threaten Americans\u2019 financial independence, as the government would be able to surveil the uses of a centralized digital currency [1]. This surveillance capability enables the government to monitor citizens' spending habits, potentially chilling dissent and enabling discriminatory practices. The Republican Policy Committee points out the danger of CBDCs, emphasizing the potential loss of financial independence and increased government control [1]. Considering that funds will flow within the system, with money being sent from a commercial bank through a Fed account to its ultimate recipient [9], CBDCs introduce significant privacy risks and are fundamentally the antithesis of American values [4].\n\nSecond, CBDCs create systemic cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. ScienceDirect indicates that CBDC, as a digital form of fiat currency, is subject to cybersecurity issues, which could pose risks to the entire financial system [5]. Any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of the entire financial system [5]. Centralizing financial data in a single, government-controlled system makes it a prime target for cyberattacks, potentially leading to widespread economic disruption and loss of assets. The Bank for International Settlements (BIS) points out that a key risk involves potential gaps in central banks' internal capabilities and skills to safeguard against evolving cyber threats [5].\n\nThird, CBDCs undermine the existing commercial banking system and access to credit. McKinsey & Company warns that CBDCs may reduce commercial bank revenues through deposit substitution and lower transaction fees [7]. This could lead to banks facing funding challenges if CBDCs replace deposits, impacting their liquidity and reserves [7]. The Independent Community Bankers of America (ICBA) argues that a U.S. CBDC would obstruct the ability of banks to take deposits and make loans [9]. If banks are disintermediated, their ability to lend is reduced, potentially leading to credit crunches and economic slowdown.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a CBDC in the United States poses significant risks to individual privacy, cybersecurity, and the stability of the financial system. For these reasons, we strongly oppose the adoption of a central bank digital currency.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Risks of CBDCs. Cato Institute.

      "stage": "rebuttal",
      "side": "for",
      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.\n\nFirst, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy [1]. However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data [2]. Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy [3]. Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities [4]. Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy\u2014something a CBDC is designed to promote\u2014is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism [5].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks [6]. However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design [7]. DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security [8]. This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 [9]. Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing [10]. Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers [11]. While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems [12]. The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion [13]. Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role [14]. The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Emmer.house.gov.

CBDCs face cybersecurity risks similar to existing systems but also unique challenges like increased centralization and potential privacy issues.

It eliminates the risk of a single entity controlling the system. https://www.parangat.com/understanding-differences-between-distributed-ledger-dlt-vs-blockchain/\n(8) Investopedia.com. Because DLT is a decentralized system, there is no central point of control or failure. This makes DLT more resilient to attacks and less vulnerable to system-wide failures. Also, because DLT uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data, it is nearly impossible to tamper with or forge records. This enhances the trustworthiness of the data and reduces the risk of fraud. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp\n(9) Statista.com. Financial institutions faced a 330% increase in cyberattacks from 2019 to 2023, with 744 incidents in the U.S. alone in 2023. Ransomware attacks on financial institutions rose significantly, and the average cost of a data breach in this sector is $5.85 million. Banks experienced a 53% increase in cyber attacks per week in the past year. https://www.statista.com/topics/9918/cyber-crime-and-the-financial-industry-in-the-united-states/\n(10) Gi-de.com. CBDC security experts emphasize cryptography, quantum-resistant algorithms, and robust cybersecurity measures. Central banks collaborate with tech firms and academia for secure design. Post-quantum computing threats require proactive cryptographic solutions. https://www.gi-de.com/en/currency-technology/digital-currency-ecosystem/retail-cbdc/cbdc-implementation\n(11) Federalreserve.gov. CBDCs can be more costly than traditional payment systems due to operational complexities, but may reduce cash handling costs for businesses. Central bank design and technology choices significantly impact CBDC costs. Some implementations may lower costs through private sector involvement. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(12) Federalreserve.gov. Ultimately, however, a central bank's operating costs for a CBDC would depend greatly on its design. In some cases, these costs could be lower than that of an automated clearinghouse, instant payment system, or large value payment system if a decentralized arrangement involving the private sector were used to process transactions. In such arrangements, the private sector would maintain and operate some of the hardware used to settle and record transactions. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(13) Atlanticcouncil.org.

      "content": "Thank you chair person. Esteem judges ladies and gentlemen the affirmatives rebuttals fail to adequately address the core concerns surrounding a us cbdc. They attempt to assuage our concerns about privacy cybersecurity and costs but their arguments are ultimately unconvincing. First let's address the judging criteria. The affirmative insists on maximizing economic stability and growth as the sole measure of success. We argue that this is a dangerously narrow view as the risks of central bank digital currency in the united states. The implementation of central bank digital currencies as the primary medium of exchange would exacerbate the flaws of our current fiat system. True progress isn't just about boosting gdp. It's about safeguarding fundamental rights. Even if a cbdc offers a marginal economic benefit. The potential cost to individual liberty and financial freedom outweighs any supposed gain. History is replete with examples where prioritizing economic growth at all costs led to authoritarianism and societal harm. Are we willing to sacrifice our freedom on the altar of economic efficiency. Second the affirmative claims that privacy by design will eliminate our concerns about government surveillance. This is simply not realistic. As studies mentioned privacy concerns for central bank digital currency in the us including mass surveillance. Cybersecurity risks and potential data misuse. While privacy protection is a key design feature being considered. The promise of secure data handling doesn't erase the inherent risk of centralized data collection. As cited in the risks of central bank digital currency in the united states a cbdc does not offer any unique benefit to the american people. But it does post serious risks to financial privacy freedom markets and cybersecurity. Data breaches occur even with the most sophisticated security measures. Furthermore we reject the argument that because current digital payment systems possess tracking capabilities. We should accept more traceability in the hands of the government. That's like saying because petty theft exists we should legalize grand larceny. The government's ability to monitor every transaction. Create a chilling effect on free expression and opens the door to potential abuse. Third the affirmative touts the security of decentralized ledger technology as a solution to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While dlt offers potential benefits it's not a silver bullet. And security risks include data breaches fraud and attacks on central bank digital currency systems 5. Excited by the source above these systems must be safeguarded against evolving threats and quantum computing poses a new risk to encryption and central banks face security challenges in deploying cbdc. Successful attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and other dlt based systems. Demonstrate that these technologies are not immune to hacking. Moreover the affirmative ignores the fact that traditional financial systems have benefited from decades of security investments and hardening. A nascent dlt based cbdc would lack this crucial foundation. Making it a prime target for cyber criminals. Finally the affirmative points to the successful implementation of cbdcs in the bahamas jamaica and nigeria. As evidence of their viability. With all due respect. These are vastly different economic contexts in the united states. What works in a small island nation with limited financial infrastructure may not scale effectively or safely? In a complex technologically advanced economy like ours. As the bank policy institute points out there are currently no reliable estimates of the true cost of developing and implementing a us cbdc. The alternative to central bank digital currency in the us include stable coins and intermediated cbdc models.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Cato Institute, \"Risks of Central Bank Digital Currency in the United States.\"\n(2) ProMarket, \"The Banking Risks of Central Bank Digital Currencies,\" June 1, 2023.\n(3) Modern Diplomacy, \"Multiple Central Bank Digital Currency Platforms: An Alternative to the Dollar-Based Payment System,\" August 12, 2024.\n(4) University of Florida Levin College of Law, \"Privacy in the Age of Central Bank Digital Currencies,\" 2022\n(5) ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609"

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the privacy implications, cybersecurity risks, and economic costs associated with a U.S. central bank digital currency.\n\nThe core battleground of this debate is **privacy**. Our opponents suggest a CBDC can be designed with privacy in mind, but this overlooks the fundamental issue. A CBDC inherently concentrates power, creating a system ripe for potential abuse [1]. Regulations are insufficient to guarantee privacy, as they can be altered or circumvented [2]. Even if data is anonymized, it can still be re-identified through metadata analysis [3]. While existing digital systems track transactions, a CBDC amplifies this surveillance, creating a permanent record of every financial activity. This could have a chilling effect on free speech and association [4].\n\nAnother key battleground is **cybersecurity**. The affirmative touts decentralized ledger technology, but this does not eliminate the risk of a single point of failure [5]. Centralizing all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, leading to widespread economic disruption [6]. Diversifying across many financial institutions, as we do now, provides a more resilient and secure financial system [7].\n\nFinally, the debate centers on **cost**. The affirmative suggests long-term savings will outweigh initial investments, but this remains unproven. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency [8]. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a U.S. CBDC poses significant risks to individual privacy, financial security, and economic stability. We urge you to oppose its adoption.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n(2) America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n(3) Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n(4) Risks of central bank digital currency in the united states, Cato Institute\n(5) ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n(6) America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n(7) Central bank digital currency impact on commercial banks, McKinsey\n(8) Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021"
