      "content": "We're here today to discuss a pivotal question shaping the future of American finance: Should the United States implement a central bank digital currency? To be clear, when we advocate for a CBDC, we propose that the Federal Reserve develop and implement a digital form of U.S. currency, accessible to all residents and businesses. This CBDC would complement existing payment methods like cash and debit cards, operating under established financial privacy laws. Our goal is to boost payment efficiency, enhance financial inclusion, and ensure the dollar's continued international prominence.\n\nThe central question in this debate is: Which approach best expands economic opportunity for all Americans while ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the evolving global financial landscape?\n\nWith that framework in mind, let's examine why a CBDC is a strategic imperative for the United States. First, a CBDC significantly promotes financial inclusion by extending access to digital payments for those currently excluded from the traditional banking system. According to the *Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)*, their most recent survey found that in 2021, 4.5% of U.S. households, representing 5.9 million families, were unbanked [1]. A CBDC offers a government-backed digital alternative, functioning as a basic digital wallet, thereby enabling full participation in the modern economy. Furthermore, the *FDIC* also noted a significant increase in smartphone access among unbanked households, with access doubling between 2013 and 2023, reaching 72.1% [2]. This widespread access to technology makes a CBDC a viable solution for reaching those currently excluded from the traditional banking system. Imagine a single mother being able to receive child tax credit payments instantly and without fees, directly to her phone.\n\nSecond, a central bank digital currency demonstrably reduces transaction costs, particularly benefiting small businesses. Small businesses currently face average credit card processing fees ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, as reported by multiple sources [3]. A CBDC streamlines transactions by reducing reliance on traditional banking systems and eliminating intermediaries, thereby lowering fees and enhancing efficiency. Think of a local bakery being able to accept payments directly from customers without paying a cut to credit card companies. This directness translates to tangible savings for businesses, fostering growth and competitiveness.\n\nFinally, the U.S. must embrace CBDC innovation to maintain its global financial leadership. Other nations are actively developing CBDCs, and the *Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker* emphasizes that the absence of U.S. leadership in setting international standards could have geopolitical consequences [5]. A U.S. CBDC can help maintain the leading role of the U.S. dollar in the world financial system. As *the Federal Reserve* has noted, as foreign monetary unions and countries like China introduce their own CBDCs, demand for U.S. dollars abroad may fall [6]. By proactively developing a CBDC, the U.S. can shape the future of digital finance, ensuring the dollar remains a dominant force in international trade and finance. To illustrate, a highly interoperable U.S. CBDC could strengthen the dollar's standing as a medium of exchange, according to the report *Implications of a U.S. CBDC for International Payments and the Role of the Dollar* [7]. The U.S. must address key issues such as interoperability, data privacy, and security to shape international standards for CBDCs.\n\nIn conclusion, a CBDC is a vital step toward a more inclusive, efficient, and competitive financial future for the United States.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] FDIC. 2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.\n[2] FDIC. 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.\n[3] A Breakdown of Payment Processing Fees for Small Businesses.\n[4] Ripple.

      "content": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[1] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[2] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[3] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[4] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021"

      "content": "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We firmly advocate for implementing a US CBDC because it's a crucial upgrade for our financial system in this digital age. It's about ensuring no one is left behind and that the U.S. remains a leader in the global economy.\n\nFirst, let's underscore how a CBDC dramatically expands financial inclusion. The *2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households* shows that a significant 14.2 percent of U.S. households, about 19 million, are underbanked [1]. A CBDC provides these individuals with a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking. It's like building a digital on-ramp, granting access to the financial system for those historically excluded. This reduces barriers and lowers transaction costs, fostering competition and ultimately reducing the cost of financial services for everyone.\n\nSecond, a CBDC significantly boosts payment system efficiency and our international competitiveness. Current systems are often slow and costly due to intermediaries. *A 2022 Fed report* highlights that a CBDC could support faster and cheaper payments, including cross-border transactions [2]. The *U.S. Department of the Treasury* has also emphasized the need for the United States to collaborate with international partners on digital payment standards to reduce inefficiencies and ensure alignment with U.S. values and legal requirements [3]. This is not just about convenience; it's about maintaining the dollar's global status as other countries actively explore and implement CBDCs.\n\nThird, a CBDC plays a crucial role in curbing illicit activities. Currently, cash is often favored for illegal transactions due to its anonymity. A CBDC, with its inherent traceability, acts as a deterrent to money laundering and terrorist financing. It's like adding a digital paper trail to every transaction, making it harder for criminals to hide their activities.\n\nNow, let's address the privacy concerns. The opposition suggests a CBDC enables government monitoring. However, this already exists with current digital payment systems! We can implement specific data anonymization techniques, such as masking and aggregation, to protect user identities. We can also establish strict limits on data retention, with automatic deletion after a set period, and create independent oversight mechanisms, like a privacy review board, to ensure compliance.\n\nRegarding the potential for abuse of power, the central bank can be subject to rigorous oversight and checks and balances to ensure accountability. Moreover, we can design the CBDC with limited traceability, focusing on detecting and preventing illicit activities while safeguarding legitimate users' privacy.\n\nFinally, concerning cyberattacks, the central bank is arguably better equipped to defend against systemic risks than private entities due to its resources and expertise. We can implement security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. Furthermore, the development costs associated with a CBDC should be viewed as an investment in modernizing our financial infrastructure, ultimately leading to a more resilient and efficient economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of a CBDC far outweigh the potential risks, especially when those risks are proactively addressed through careful design and regulation. We must embrace this innovation to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more competitive economy for all Americans.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households | FDIC.gov\n[2] Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital ...\n[3] Fact Sheet: Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets | U.S. Department of the Treasury"

      "content": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nYou tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Cato Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies, 2024\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion, The World Bank"

      "content": "Esteemed judges, we've shown how a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and security. Our opponents have concentrated on privacy, cybersecurity, and cost. However, the core issue is balance.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s tackle privacy. We agree it's crucial. However, design and regulations can ensure confidentiality. *The Brookings Institution noted in 2023* that a CBDC can incorporate privacy-enhancing technologies [1]. Existing digital systems already track financial transactions. A CBDC, with proper safeguards, doesn't fundamentally  alter this landscape.\n\nSecond, regarding cybersecurity, our opponents worry about single points of failure. However, this ignores decentralized designs. *A 2022 Atlantic Council report* indicates that CBDCs can use distributed ledger technology to boost security and resilience [2]. Our cybersecurity plans adapt to counter emerging threats. We are not static; we continuously evolve our defenses.\n\nFinally, let's consider cost. The opponents overstate implementation costs. Long-term, a CBDC is more affordable than maintaining older systems. *A 2023 study by the Digital Dollar Project* suggests that a CBDC's long-term operational costs could be lower than existing payment systems due to increased efficiency and reduced fraud [3].\n\nThis debate presents two paths: economic expansion and stability that promote freedom, or stagnation rooted in fear. Our vision promotes both liberty and security. The choice is clear. A CBDC is vital for a thriving, secure future. Vote for progress. Support a US CBDC!"

      "content": "Esteemed judges, this debate boils down to a fundamental choice: are we willing to trade our freedom for the illusion of economic efficiency? Our opponents propose a convenient financial system, but we contend that it demands an unacceptable sacrifice of privacy and liberty.\n\nFirst, consider surveillance. While the opposition suggests CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, this is fundamentally  flawed. A CBDC concentrates unprecedented power, centralizing all financial data and making it easily accessible to government entities. As *the American Civil Liberties Union* clearly stated, \"the risk of government surveillance and control over our financial lives is simply too great\" [1]. Regulations are insufficient because they can be easily altered.\n\nSecond, the cybersecurity risk is undeniable. The opposition mentioned decentralized ledger technology, but this does not eliminate the core risk. A centralized CBDC creates a massive target for hackers. According to *a 2022 report by the cybersecurity firm FireEye*, \"centralized financial systems are prime targets for sophisticated cyberattacks\" [2]. A successful attack would disrupt the entire economy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s not forget the cost to taxpayers. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management will be borne by the public, with no guarantee of any real benefits.\n\nIn closing, remember that economic stability is not the only consideration. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. A US CBDC is a step too far. Do not let the promise of efficiency blind you to the dangers of unchecked government power. We strongly urge you to oppose the implementation of a CBDC."

        "original_statement": "We're here today to discuss whether the United States should implement a central bank digital currency. To ensure we're all on the same page, let me define what we mean by a CBDC. When we say the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, we mean that the federal government, through the Federal Reserve, should develop and implement a digital currency. This currency would be available to all U.S. residents and businesses. It would complement existing forms of money, like cash and debit cards, and be regulated under existing financial privacy laws. Our goal is to improve payment efficiency, financial inclusion, and maintain the dollar's international standing.\n\nThe most important criteria for judging this debate is which side better promotes economic opportunity for all Americans and ensures the U.S. maintains its global financial leadership in an ever-changing world.\n\nWith that in mind, let's look at why a CBDC is a good idea for the United States. First, CBDCs promote financial inclusion by providing access to digital payments for the unbanked. Many low-income individuals lack bank accounts. A CBDC offers a government-backed digital alternative that's easily accessible. It's like giving everyone a basic digital wallet, allowing them to participate fully in the modern economy.\n\nSecond, a central bank digital currency will reduce transaction costs for everyone, especially for small businesses. CBDCs eliminate intermediaries and lower fees, which improves efficiency and lowers the cost of doing business. Think of it like this: today, every online purchase involves multiple parties taking a small cut. A CBDC streamlines that process, saving everyone money. These savings would be magnified for small businesses.\n\nThird, the U.S. can maintain its global financial leadership through CBDC innovation. Other countries are exploring CBDCs; the U.S. must innovate to stay competitive and influence international standards. Imagine a race where other countries are developing faster cars. If the United States doesn't innovate, it risks falling behind. By taking a proactive approach, the U.S. can help shape the future of digital finance and ensure the dollar remains a dominant force.\n\nIn short, a CBDC is a step toward a more inclusive, efficient, and competitive financial future for the United States.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan**:\n\nOkay, here's the plan for my opening statement. First, I will clarify our definition of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to set the stage for this debate (75 words). Second, I will establish that the debate should be judged based on which side best promotes economic opportunity and maintains U.S. financial leadership (50 words). Third, I'll present three main arguments: CBDCs promote financial inclusion, reduce transaction costs, and help the U.S. maintain global financial leadership (375 words).\nI will use simple analogies and metaphors to explain my points more clearly, and I will avoid the straw man fallacy by accurately representing my opponent's potential arguments. Finally, I will conclude with a summary (22 words).",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The opening statement clearly defines a CBDC and its intended purpose, focusing on improving payment efficiency, financial inclusion, and maintaining the dollar's international standing. The logical flow is easy to follow, with three main arguments presented sequentially. The concept of a CBDC is made accessible, though the explanation of its regulation under existing financial privacy laws could be further elaborated for complete clarity.\n\nEngagement Impact: The statement employs relatable examples and analogies, such as \"giving everyone a basic digital wallet\" and comparing CBDC development to a \"race where other countries are developing faster cars.\" These analogies connect with the audience's interests and make the arguments more memorable. The attention is maintained through clear, concise language and a focus on practical benefits.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The statement provides logical reasons to support each argument. The arguments for financial inclusion, reduced transaction costs, and maintaining global financial leadership are logically presented. While no specific data or expert opinions are cited, the rationale behind each point is easy to understand.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The statement appeals to emotions by highlighting the potential for greater financial inclusion and economic opportunity for all Americans. It also emphasizes the practical relevance of a CBDC in a rapidly changing global financial landscape. The call to action is implicit - supporting the implementation of a CBDC.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of specific data or evidence to support claims. For example, stating that CBDCs reduce transaction costs is a good point, but lacking numbers could make the statement weak.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience might view the arguments as speculative or lacking a strong foundation. Without evidence, the claims of improved efficiency, financial inclusion, and global competitiveness are not very persuasive.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Include a statistic or a real-world example of another country's experience with a CBDC that demonstrates reduced transaction costs or increased financial inclusion. Quantifiable data strengthens the arguments.\n\n2. Issue: The statement that a CBDC would be \"regulated under existing financial privacy laws\" is vague.\n   Impact on Audience: This statement is not very helpful, and might be confusing since existing financial privacy laws were not made to regulate cryptocurrency, and cryptocurrency is anonymous by nature. A CBDC's regulation under existing financial privacy laws would be one of its competitive advantages.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Briefly mention the specific types of privacy protections that would be in place. For example, \"ensuring that transactions are subject to the same privacy protections as traditional bank accounts\" or \"adhering to existing laws regarding data security and consumer protection.\"\n\n3. Issue: Over-reliance on broad generalizations without addressing potential downsides.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience may perceive the argument as one-sided and may wonder about potential risks or challenges associated with implementing a CBDC, such as security concerns or the impact on commercial banks.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Acknowledge a potential counter-argument, such as concerns about cybersecurity or government overreach, and briefly offer a rebuttal or mitigation strategy. This demonstrates a balanced perspective.\n\n4. Issue: The \"global financial leadership\" argument is abstract and needs stronger justification.\n   Impact on Audience: It is not immediately clear why a CBDC is essential for maintaining U.S. global financial leadership. The analogy of the \"race\" is helpful, but it lacks a concrete explanation of the mechanisms through which a CBDC would ensure the dollar remains dominant.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Elaborate on the specific ways a CBDC would help the U.S. shape the future of digital finance and maintain the dollar's dominance, such as by setting international standards for digital currency interoperability or facilitating cross-border payments.\n"

            "We're here today to discuss a critical question for the future of American finance: Should the United States implement a central bank digital currency? To ensure clarity, when we advocate for a CBDC, we mean the Federal Reserve should develop and implement a digital form of U.S. currency, accessible to all residents and businesses. This CBDC would complement existing payment methods like cash and debit cards, operating under established financial privacy laws. Our aim is to foster payment efficiency, enhance financial inclusion, and preserve the dollar's international prominence.\n\nThe central question in this debate is: Which approach best expands economic opportunity for all Americans while ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the evolving global financial landscape?\n\nWith that framework in mind, let's examine why a CBDC is a strategic imperative for the United States. First, a CBDC significantly promotes financial inclusion by extending access to digital payments for the unbanked and underbanked. According to the *Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)*, their most recent survey found that in 2021, 4.5% of U.S. households, representing 5.9 million families, were unbanked [1]. A CBDC offers a government-backed digital alternative, functioning as a basic digital wallet, thereby enabling full participation in the modern economy. Furthermore, the *FDIC* also noted a significant increase in smartphone access among unbanked households, with access doubling between 2013 and 2023, reaching 72.1% [2]. This widespread access to technology makes a CBDC a viable solution for reaching those currently excluded from the traditional banking system.\n\nSecond, a central bank digital currency demonstrably reduces transaction costs, particularly benefiting small businesses. Currently, small businesses face average credit card processing fees ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, as reported by multiple sources [3]. A CBDC streamlines transactions by reducing reliance on traditional banking systems and eliminating intermediaries, thereby lowering fees and enhancing efficiency. As *Ripple* pointed out, digital currencies can remove frictions and improve merchant operations via new efficiency models that enable real-time payments [4]. This directness translates to tangible savings for businesses, fostering growth and competitiveness.\n\nFinally, the U.S. must embrace CBDC innovation to maintain its global financial leadership. Other nations are actively developing CBDCs, and the *Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker* emphasizes that the absence of U.S. leadership in setting international standards could have geopolitical consequences [5]. A U.S. CBDC can help maintain the leading role of the U.S. dollar in the world financial system. As foreign monetary unions and countries like China introduce their own CBDCs, demand for U.S. dollars abroad may fall, according to *the Federal Reserve* [6]. By proactively developing a CBDC, the U.S. can shape the future of digital finance, ensuring the dollar remains a dominant force in international trade and finance. As noted in *Implications of a U.S. CBDC for International Payments and the Role of the Dollar*, a highly interoperable U.S. CBDC could strengthen the dollar's standing as a medium of exchange [7].\n\nIn conclusion, a CBDC is a vital step toward a more inclusive, efficient, and competitive financial future for the United States.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] FDIC. 2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.\n[2] FDIC. 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.\n[3] A Breakdown of Payment Processing Fees for Small Businesses.\n[4] Ripple.

        "original_statement": "We're here today to discuss a critical question for the future of American finance: Should the United States implement a central bank digital currency? To ensure clarity, when we advocate for a CBDC, we mean the Federal Reserve should develop and implement a digital form of U.S. currency, accessible to all residents and businesses. This CBDC would complement existing payment methods like cash and debit cards, operating under established financial privacy laws. Our aim is to foster payment efficiency, enhance financial inclusion, and preserve the dollar's international prominence.\n\nThe central question in this debate is: Which approach best expands economic opportunity for all Americans while ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the evolving global financial landscape?\n\nWith that framework in mind, let's examine why a CBDC is a strategic imperative for the United States. First, a CBDC significantly promotes financial inclusion by extending access to digital payments for the unbanked and underbanked. According to the *Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)*, their most recent survey found that in 2021, 4.5% of U.S. households, representing 5.9 million families, were unbanked [1]. A CBDC offers a government-backed digital alternative, functioning as a basic digital wallet, thereby enabling full participation in the modern economy. Furthermore, the *FDIC* also noted a significant increase in smartphone access among unbanked households, with access doubling between 2013 and 2023, reaching 72.1% [2]. This widespread access to technology makes a CBDC a viable solution for reaching those currently excluded from the traditional banking system.\n\nSecond, a central bank digital currency demonstrably reduces transaction costs, particularly benefiting small businesses. Currently, small businesses face average credit card processing fees ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, as reported by multiple sources [3]. A CBDC streamlines transactions by reducing reliance on traditional banking systems and eliminating intermediaries, thereby lowering fees and enhancing efficiency. As *Ripple* pointed out, digital currencies can remove frictions and improve merchant operations via new efficiency models that enable real-time payments [4]. This directness translates to tangible savings for businesses, fostering growth and competitiveness.\n\nFinally, the U.S. must embrace CBDC innovation to maintain its global financial leadership. Other nations are actively developing CBDCs, and the *Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker* emphasizes that the absence of U.S. leadership in setting international standards could have geopolitical consequences [5]. A U.S. CBDC can help maintain the leading role of the U.S. dollar in the world financial system. As foreign monetary unions and countries like China introduce their own CBDCs, demand for U.S. dollars abroad may fall, according to *the Federal Reserve* [6]. By proactively developing a CBDC, the U.S. can shape the future of digital finance, ensuring the dollar remains a dominant force in international trade and finance. As noted in *Implications of a U.S. CBDC for International Payments and the Role of the Dollar*, a highly interoperable U.S. CBDC could strengthen the dollar's standing as a medium of exchange [7].\n\nIn conclusion, a CBDC is a vital step toward a more inclusive, efficient, and competitive financial future for the United States.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] FDIC. 2021 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.\n[2] FDIC. 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households.\n[3] A Breakdown of Payment Processing Fees for Small Businesses.\n[4] Ripple.

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The opening statement is well-structured and presents a clear argument for the implementation of a CBDC in the United States. The definition of a CBDC is accessible, and the logical flow of the three main arguments (financial inclusion, reduced transaction costs, and global financial leadership) is easy to follow. The use of specific data and sources enhances the credibility of the claims.\n\nEngagement Impact: The statement effectively uses data and examples to connect with the audience's interests. Highlighting the percentage of unbanked households and the prevalence of smartphone access makes the argument for financial inclusion more relatable. The discussion of credit card processing fees directly addresses a pain point for small businesses. The \"race\" analogy is still effective but now reinforced with actual sources and competitive implications.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The inclusion of specific data from the FDIC and the Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker significantly strengthens the evidence presentation. The sources are relevant and support the claims made. The interpretation of the data is clear and easy to understand.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The statement appeals to emotions by emphasizing the potential for greater financial inclusion and economic opportunity for underserved populations. The discussion of reduced transaction costs has practical relevance for businesses. The argument regarding global financial leadership taps into a sense of national pride and competitiveness. The overall feasibility of the solution is enhanced by the inclusion of data on smartphone access.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: The statement is source-heavy, but the sources are presented awkwardly in the statement.\n   Impact on Audience: Overuse of sources in the statement can impact the flow and the overall impact to the audience.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Integrate the source properly. For example, instead of \"*Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)*, their most recent survey found that in 2021, 4.5% of U.S. households...\" try \"According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), 4.5% of U.S. households...\".\n\n2. Issue: The \"Ripple\" source seems out of place and might be perceived as biased.\n   Impact on Audience: Including a statement from a company that has a vested interest in the adoption of digital currencies could undermine the objectivity of the argument.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Replace the \"Ripple\" citation with a more neutral and authoritative source, such as a study from a reputable academic institution or a report from a government agency that analyzes the potential for digital currencies to reduce transaction costs. If Ripple offers unique data, present the data instead.\n\n3. Issue: While the statement acknowledges the importance of U.S. leadership in setting international standards, it doesn't elaborate on the specific challenges or opportunities that the U.S. would face in this area.\n   Impact on Audience: The argument for maintaining global financial leadership could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples of the potential consequences of falling behind or the benefits of taking a proactive approach.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Briefly discuss some of the key issues that the U.S. would need to address in shaping international standards for CBDCs, such as interoperability, data privacy, and security. This would demonstrate a deeper understanding of the complexities involved and enhance the credibility of the argument.\n"

As *the Federal Reserve* has noted, as foreign monetary unions and countries like China introduce their own CBDCs, demand for U.S. dollars abroad may fall [6]. By proactively developing a CBDC, the U.S. can shape the future of digital finance, ensuring the dollar remains a dominant force in international trade and finance. To illustrate, a highly interoperable U.S. CBDC could strengthen the dollar's standing as a medium of exchange, according to the report *Implications of a U.S. CBDC for International Payments and the Role of the Dollar* [7]. The U.S. must address key issues such as interoperability, data privacy, and security to shape international standards for CBDCs.",

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[1] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[2] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[3] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[4] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021",

Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny.

        "original_statement": "Let's dive right in. We believe a US CBDC is a necessary step for economic stability and growth, as we have discussed.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce how a CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Millions of Americans are currently unbanked or underbanked. A CBDC offers a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative. It reduces barriers and transaction costs, fostering competition in the payment market and lowering financial service costs. Think of it as building a digital on-ramp to the financial system for those left behind.\n\nSecond, a CBDC improves payment system efficiency and boosts international competitiveness. Current systems are slow and costly due to intermediaries. A CBDC streamlines transactions, making payments faster and more secure, especially for cross-border deals. It also protects the dollar's global status. Other countries are moving forward with CBDCs; the U.S. needs to stay in the game!\n\nThird, a CBDC reduces illicit activities. Cash is king for illegal transactions because it\u2019s anonymous. A CBDC, with its traceability, deters money laundering and terrorist financing. It's like adding a digital paper trail to every transaction, making it harder for criminals to hide.\n\nNow, let\u2019s address the privacy concerns. The opposition claims a CBDC allows government monitoring. But this concern already exists with current digital payments! Strict regulations and privacy safeguards can be built into a CBDC. It's not an either-or situation.\n\nAs for the potential for abuse of power, the central bank can be subject to oversight and checks and balances. Plus, we can design the CBDC with very limited traceability.\n\nFinally, regarding cyberattacks and costs, the current financial system also has vulnerabilities. The central bank is better equipped to defend against systemic risks than private entities. Moreover, the development costs are an investment in modernizing our financial infrastructure.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of a CBDC far outweigh the potential risks. We must embrace this innovation for a stronger, more inclusive economy.",
        "allocation_plan": "**Rebuttal Plan**\n\nOkay, let's get to our rebuttal. We are still strongly FOR the implementation of a US CBDC. Our main goal is to show why a CBDC is crucial for economic stability and growth. First, I will give a short overview (30 words). Then, we'll reinforce our key arguments: financial inclusion (100 words), payment system efficiency (100 words), and reduced illicit activities (90 words). After that, we will address the concerns raised by the opponent, which are regarding the individual privacy, financial freedom (70 words), the potential for abuse of power (50 words), and cyberattacks and costs (82 words).\n\nFor rhetorical techniques, I plan to use an analogy to explain the balance between security and convenience. I will also point out the \"false dilemma\" fallacy in the opponent's argument that we must choose between privacy and economic benefits.",
        "simulated_audience_feedback": [
          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal statement reiterates the main arguments from the opening statement (financial inclusion, payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities) but doesn't directly engage with the specific points made by the opposition. The explanation of how a CBDC addresses each concern is superficial.\n\nEngagement Impact: The rebuttal uses analogies (\"digital on-ramp,\" \"digital paper trail\") to make the arguments more relatable, but these analogies are not particularly fresh or compelling. The statement lacks the depth of evidence and specific examples needed to truly resonate with the audience. The arguments have been repeated without meaningfully addressing the opposition's points.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The rebuttal statement does not provide any new evidence or data to support its claims. It simply repeats the previously stated benefits of a CBDC without addressing the specific concerns raised by the opposition regarding privacy, security, and cost. There is a lack of direct engagement with the opponent's evidence.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The statement attempts to address the opposition's concerns by claiming that privacy safeguards can be built into a CBDC and that the central bank is better equipped to defend against cyberattacks. However, these claims are not supported by evidence or detailed explanations, making them seem unconvincing.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: The rebuttal fails to directly engage with the opposition's arguments. Instead, it mostly restates the original claims without addressing the specific concerns raised about privacy, security, and cost.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience may perceive the rebuttal as dismissive and unconvincing, as it does not demonstrate a genuine effort to address the opponent's points.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Structure the rebuttal to directly address each of the opposition's main points. For example, \"The opposition argues that a CBDC would violate privacy. However, we believe...\" and then provide a specific counter-argument with supporting evidence.\n\n2. Issue: The responses to the opposition's concerns are vague and unsubstantiated. For example, the statement claims that \"strict regulations and privacy safeguards can be built into a CBDC\" without providing any details about what those safeguards would be or how they would be implemented.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience may find these claims unconvincing because they lack specificity and supporting evidence.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Provide concrete examples of the types of privacy safeguards that could be implemented in a CBDC, such as data anonymization techniques, limits on data retention, or independent oversight mechanisms. Cite examples from other countries that have successfully implemented similar safeguards.\n\n3. Issue: The rebuttal does not adequately address the opposition's concerns about the potential for abuse of power and the vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.\n   Impact on Audience: These are significant concerns that could undermine public trust in a CBDC. Failing to address them adequately weakens the argument for implementation.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Explain how the central bank would be subject to oversight and checks and balances to prevent abuse of power. Discuss specific measures that would be taken to protect the CBDC system from cyberattacks, such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, and regular security audits. Provide evidence that the central bank has a strong track record of protecting financial data and systems.\n\n4. Issue: The rebuttal lacks a strong call to action.\n   Impact on Audience: The conclusion simply states that \"the benefits of a CBDC far outweigh the potential risks\" without providing a clear sense of what the audience should do or think as a result of hearing the arguments.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: End with a more compelling call to action that encourages the audience to support the implementation of a CBDC and to engage in constructive dialogue about the specific issues that need to be addressed, such as privacy and security.\n"

            "Alright, let's get straight to it. We remain firmly in favor of implementing a US CBDC. We believe it's a vital step towards ensuring economic stability and fostering growth in our increasingly digital world.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce how a CBDC dramatically enhances financial inclusion. The *2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households* reveals that a significant portion of our population, about 14.2 percent of U.S. households, representing about 19 million households, are underbanked [1]. A CBDC offers these individuals a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking. It reduces barriers to entry and lowers transaction costs, fostering competition in the payment market and ultimately reducing the cost of financial services. Think of a CBDC as building a digital on-ramp, providing access to the financial system for those who have been historically left behind.\n\nSecond, a CBDC significantly improves payment system efficiency and boosts our international competitiveness. Current payment systems are often slow and costly due to the involvement of numerous intermediaries. A CBDC streamlines these transactions, making payments faster and more secure, particularly for cross-border transactions. As highlighted in *a Fed report in 2022*, a CBDC could support faster and cheaper payments, including cross-border payments [2]. Furthermore, it's crucial for protecting the dollar's global status. As the *U.S. Department of the Treasury* pointed out in a fact sheet, the United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for the development of digital payment architectures and CBDCs to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new payment systems are consistent with U.S. values and legal requirements [3]. Other countries are actively exploring and implementing CBDCs, and the U.S. needs to remain competitive in this evolving landscape.\n\nThird, a CBDC plays a crucial role in reducing illicit activities. Currently, cash is often the preferred method for illegal transactions due to its anonymity. However, a CBDC, with its inherent traceability, acts as a deterrent to money laundering and terrorist financing. It's akin to adding a digital paper trail to every transaction, making it significantly more difficult for criminals to conceal their activities.\n\nNow, let's directly address the privacy concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that a CBDC would enable government monitoring of financial transactions. However, this concern already exists with our current digital payment systems! The key is that strict regulations and robust privacy safeguards can and must be built into a CBDC from the outset. It's not an either-or situation where we must sacrifice privacy for economic benefits. We can implement data anonymization techniques, establish limits on data retention, and create independent oversight mechanisms to protect individual privacy.\n\nRegarding the potential for abuse of power, we acknowledge the importance of preventing this. The central bank can be subject to rigorous oversight and checks and balances to ensure accountability. Moreover, we can design the CBDC with limited traceability, focusing on detecting and preventing illicit activities while safeguarding legitimate users' privacy.\n\nFinally, concerning cyberattacks and development costs, it's important to recognize that our current financial system also faces vulnerabilities. The central bank is arguably better equipped to defend against systemic risks than private entities due to its resources and expertise. Furthermore, the development costs associated with a CBDC should be viewed as an investment in modernizing our financial infrastructure, ultimately leading to a more resilient and efficient economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of a CBDC, including enhanced financial inclusion, improved payment system efficiency, and reduced illicit activities, far outweigh the potential risks, especially when those risks are proactively addressed through careful design and regulation. We must embrace this innovation to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more competitive economy for all Americans.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households | FDIC.gov\n[2] Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital ...\n[3] Fact Sheet: Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets | U.S. Department of the Treasury\n",

        "original_statement": "Alright, let's get straight to it. We remain firmly in favor of implementing a US CBDC. We believe it's a vital step towards ensuring economic stability and fostering growth in our increasingly digital world.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce how a CBDC dramatically enhances financial inclusion. The *2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households* reveals that a significant portion of our population, about 14.2 percent of U.S. households, representing about 19 million households, are underbanked [1]. A CBDC offers these individuals a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking. It reduces barriers to entry and lowers transaction costs, fostering competition in the payment market and ultimately reducing the cost of financial services. Think of a CBDC as building a digital on-ramp, providing access to the financial system for those who have been historically left behind.\n\nSecond, a CBDC significantly improves payment system efficiency and boosts our international competitiveness. Current payment systems are often slow and costly due to the involvement of numerous intermediaries. A CBDC streamlines these transactions, making payments faster and more secure, particularly for cross-border transactions. As highlighted in *a Fed report in 2022*, a CBDC could support faster and cheaper payments, including cross-border payments [2]. Furthermore, it's crucial for protecting the dollar's global status. As the *U.S. Department of the Treasury* pointed out in a fact sheet, the United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for the development of digital payment architectures and CBDCs to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new payment systems are consistent with U.S. values and legal requirements [3]. Other countries are actively exploring and implementing CBDCs, and the U.S. needs to remain competitive in this evolving landscape.\n\nThird, a CBDC plays a crucial role in reducing illicit activities. Currently, cash is often the preferred method for illegal transactions due to its anonymity. However, a CBDC, with its inherent traceability, acts as a deterrent to money laundering and terrorist financing. It's akin to adding a digital paper trail to every transaction, making it significantly more difficult for criminals to conceal their activities.\n\nNow, let's directly address the privacy concerns raised by the opposition. They argue that a CBDC would enable government monitoring of financial transactions. However, this concern already exists with our current digital payment systems! The key is that strict regulations and robust privacy safeguards can and must be built into a CBDC from the outset. It's not an either-or situation where we must sacrifice privacy for economic benefits. We can implement data anonymization techniques, establish limits on data retention, and create independent oversight mechanisms to protect individual privacy.\n\nRegarding the potential for abuse of power, we acknowledge the importance of preventing this. The central bank can be subject to rigorous oversight and checks and balances to ensure accountability. Moreover, we can design the CBDC with limited traceability, focusing on detecting and preventing illicit activities while safeguarding legitimate users' privacy.\n\nFinally, concerning cyberattacks and development costs, it's important to recognize that our current financial system also faces vulnerabilities. The central bank is arguably better equipped to defend against systemic risks than private entities due to its resources and expertise. Furthermore, the development costs associated with a CBDC should be viewed as an investment in modernizing our financial infrastructure, ultimately leading to a more resilient and efficient economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the benefits of a CBDC, including enhanced financial inclusion, improved payment system efficiency, and reduced illicit activities, far outweigh the potential risks, especially when those risks are proactively addressed through careful design and regulation. We must embrace this innovation to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more competitive economy for all Americans.\n\n**Reference**\n[1] 2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households | FDIC.gov\n[2] Money and Payments: The U.S. Dollar in the Age of Digital ...\n[3] Fact Sheet: Framework for International Engagement on Digital Assets | U.S. Department of the Treasury",

          "[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal statement is significantly improved, directly addressing the opposition's concerns and providing more specific details and evidence. The logical flow is clear, and the arguments are presented in a structured manner. The use of data and sources strengthens the credibility of the claims.\n\nEngagement Impact: The inclusion of the FDIC data on underbanked households makes the argument for financial inclusion more compelling. Citing a Fed report on faster and cheaper payments and a Treasury Department fact sheet on international engagement enhances the perceived importance and relevance of a CBDC. The arguments are more relatable and engaging than in the previous rebuttal.\n\nEvidence Presentation: The rebuttal provides relevant data and sources to support its claims, including the FDIC survey, a Fed report, and a Treasury Department fact sheet. The interpretation of the data is clear and easy to understand. The sources directly address the concerns raised by the opposition.\n\nPersuasive Elements: The statement appeals to emotions by emphasizing the potential for greater financial inclusion and economic opportunity. It also addresses the practical relevance of a CBDC in a rapidly changing global financial landscape. The discussion of privacy safeguards and oversight mechanisms enhances the perceived feasibility of the solution.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: The explanation of privacy safeguards, while improved, still lacks a compelling and comprehensive solution. The mention of \"data anonymization techniques, limits on data retention, and independent oversight mechanisms\" is a good start, but it needs more depth.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience might still be skeptical about the effectiveness of these safeguards in preventing government surveillance and protecting individual privacy.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Elaborate on the specific data anonymization techniques that would be used, how limits on data retention would be enforced, and the structure and authority of the independent oversight mechanisms. Provide examples of how these safeguards have been successfully implemented in other contexts. Consider citing specific legal or technical standards that the CBDC would adhere to.\n\n2. Issue: The response to the concern about cyberattacks could be strengthened by providing more details about the specific security measures that would be implemented to protect the CBDC system.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience might still be worried about the potential for a catastrophic system failure due to a cyberattack.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Discuss specific security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. Explain how the central bank would work with cybersecurity experts to identify and mitigate potential threats. Emphasize the central bank's experience and expertise in protecting financial data and systems.\n\n3. Issue: While the rebuttal mentions the need for the U.S. to work with international partners, it doesn't fully address the geopolitical implications of a U.S. CBDC.\n   Impact on Audience: The audience might not fully appreciate the strategic importance of a U.S. CBDC in maintaining the dollar's global dominance and countering the influence of other countries, such as China.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Briefly discuss the potential geopolitical benefits of a U.S. CBDC, such as strengthening the dollar's role in international trade and finance, promoting U.S. values and legal requirements in the development of digital payment architectures, and countering the influence of countries with less transparent and accountable financial systems.\n"

Independent oversight would be provided by a board of experts with legal authority to investigate and address privacy violations.\n\nRegarding the potential for abuse of power, we acknowledge the importance of preventing this. The central bank can be subject to rigorous oversight and checks and balances to ensure accountability. Moreover, we can design the CBDC with limited traceability, focusing on detecting and preventing illicit activities while safeguarding legitimate users' privacy.\n\nFinally, concerning cyberattacks and development costs, it's important to recognize that our current financial system also faces vulnerabilities. The central bank is arguably better equipped to defend against systemic risks than private entities due to its resources and expertise.

            "Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We firmly advocate for implementing a US CBDC because it's a crucial step towards a more inclusive and competitive digital economy.\n\nFirst, let's reinforce how a CBDC dramatically enhances financial inclusion. The *2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households* reveals that a significant portion of our population, about 14.2 percent of U.S. households, are underbanked [1]. A CBDC offers these individuals a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking. It reduces barriers to entry and lowers transaction costs, fostering competition and ultimately reducing the cost of financial services. Think of a CBDC as building a digital on-ramp, providing access to the financial system for those historically left behind.\n\nSecond, a CBDC significantly improves payment system efficiency and boosts our international competitiveness. Current payment systems are often slow and costly due to intermediaries. *A Fed report in 2022* highlights that a CBDC could support faster and cheaper payments, including cross-border payments [2]. Furthermore, it's crucial for protecting the dollar's global status. As the *U.S. Department of the Treasury* pointed out, the United States must continue to work with international partners on standards for digital payment architectures and CBDCs to reduce payment inefficiencies and ensure that any new payment systems are consistent with U.S. values and legal requirements [3].\n\nThird, a CBDC plays a crucial role in reducing illicit activities. Currently, cash is often the preferred method for illegal transactions due to its anonymity. However, a CBDC, with its inherent traceability, acts as a deterrent to money laundering and terrorist financing. It's akin to adding a digital paper trail to every transaction, making it significantly more difficult for criminals to conceal their activities.\n\nNow, let's directly address the privacy concerns raised. The key is that strict regulations and robust privacy safeguards can and must be built into a CBDC from the outset. We can implement data anonymization techniques, establish limits on data retention, and create independent oversight mechanisms to protect individual privacy.\n\nRegarding the potential for abuse of power, the central bank can be subject to rigorous oversight and checks and balances to ensure accountability.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden.

Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy [3]. Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities [4]. Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy\u2014something a CBDC is designed to promote\u2014is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism [5].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks [6]. However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design [7]. DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security [8]. This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 [9]. Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing [10]. Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers [11]. While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems [12]. The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion [13]. Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role [14]. The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Emmer.house.gov.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nYou tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Cato Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies, 2024\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion, The World Bank",

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[1] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[2] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[3] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[4] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021",

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.\n\nFirst, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy [1]. However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data [2]. Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy [3]. Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities [4]. Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy\u2014something a CBDC is designed to promote\u2014is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism [5].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks [6]. However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design [7]. DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security [8]. This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 [9]. Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing [10]. Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers [11]. While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems [12]. The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion [13]. Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role [14]. The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Emmer.house.gov.

CBDCs face cybersecurity risks similar to existing systems but also unique challenges like increased centralization and potential privacy issues. They require robust cybersecurity frameworks to protect against cyber-attacks and maintain financial stability. Effective risk management is crucial for CBDC implementation. https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/missing-key/\n(7) Parangat.com. Decentralized ledger technology avoids single points of failure by distributing data across multiple nodes. This structure enhances security and resilience against attacks. It eliminates the risk of a single entity controlling the system. https://www.parangat.com/understanding-differences-between-distributed-ledger-dlt-vs-blockchain/\n(8) Investopedia.com. Because DLT is a decentralized system, there is no central point of control or failure. This makes DLT more resilient to attacks and less vulnerable to system-wide failures. Also, because DLT uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data, it is nearly impossible to tamper with or forge records. This enhances the trustworthiness of the data and reduces the risk of fraud. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp\n(9) Statista.com. Financial institutions faced a 330% increase in cyberattacks from 2019 to 2023, with 744 incidents in the U.S. alone in 2023. Ransomware attacks on financial institutions rose significantly, and the average cost of a data breach in this sector is $5.85 million. Banks experienced a 53% increase in cyber attacks per week in the past year. https://www.statista.com/topics/9918/cyber-crime-and-the-financial-industry-in-the-united-states/\n(10) Gi-de.com. CBDC security experts emphasize cryptography, quantum-resistant algorithms, and robust cybersecurity measures. Central banks collaborate with tech firms and academia for secure design. Post-quantum computing threats require proactive cryptographic solutions. https://www.gi-de.com/en/currency-technology/digital-currency-ecosystem/retail-cbdc/cbdc-implementation\n(11) Federalreserve.gov. CBDCs can be more costly than traditional payment systems due to operational complexities, but may reduce cash handling costs for businesses. Central bank design and technology choices significantly impact CBDC costs. Some implementations may lower costs through private sector involvement. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(12) Federalreserve.gov. Ultimately, however, a central bank's operating costs for a CBDC would depend greatly on its design. In some cases, these costs could be lower than that of an automated clearinghouse, instant payment system, or large value payment system if a decentralized arrangement involving the private sector were used to process transactions. In such arrangements, the private sector would maintain and operate some of the hardware used to settle and record transactions. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(13) Atlanticcouncil.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nYou tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Cato Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies, 2024\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion, The World Bank",

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

To be clear, we understand they define a CBDC as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Think about it: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A CBDC is like putting all your eggs in one basket, and then leaving that basket on the internet for hackers to find. One successful attack, and the entire system could come crashing down. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration and promotes decentralization, which are major safeguards against tyranny. The inherent risk outweighs any potential benefits or future safeguards.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden.

        "allocation_plan": "**Opening Plan:**\n\nOkay, here's the plan. I'll start by briefly addressing the opponent's definition of CBDC, just to clarify that we understand the scope of the debate. Then, I will quickly point out the limits of their judging criteria, which focuses solely on economic stability and growth, and propose that we also need to consider things like personal freedom. After that, I will present three main arguments against a U.S. CBDC. First, a CBDC could enable government surveillance. Second, a CBDC creates a single point of failure. Third, a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers. I will allocate more words to the surveillance and single point of failure arguments because those are the most compelling and have the biggest potential impact. I will use one analogy to enhance the single point of failure arguments.\n\nHere's the word allocation:\n\n*   Definition: 30 words\n*   Judging Criteria: 40 words\n*   Surveillance: 150 words\n*   Single Point of Failure: 180 words\n*   Taxpayer Costs: 122 words\n\nTotal: 522 words",

          "## Output:\n\n[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The core message is generally clear: The against side opposes a US CBDC due to concerns about privacy, security, and cost. The arguments are presented in a logical order. However, some of the connections between the risks and the proposed CBDC could be strengthened with more specific examples or explanations. The explanation of \"single point of failure\" could be more explicit.\nEngagement Impact: The examples used are relatable and help to illustrate the potential negative consequences of a CBDC (e.g., government monitoring of spending habits, cyberattacks). The analogy of \"putting all your eggs in one basket\" is effective. The questions posed to the audience (\"Would this money be better spent on infrastructure, education, or healthcare?\") are designed to engage them emotionally and intellectually.\nEvidence Presentation: This opening statement relies more on logical arguments and potential consequences than on empirical evidence. While this can be effective, incorporating some data or expert opinions on the risks of surveillance, cyberattacks on financial systems, or the costs of implementing a CBDC would strengthen the arguments. The \"promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration and promotes decentralization\" sounds good, but needs to be supported and/or fleshed out.\nPersuasive Elements: The emotional resonance is strong, playing on fears of government overreach, financial insecurity, and wasted taxpayer money. The arguments are framed in terms of protecting individual freedoms and financial stability, which are likely to resonate with a broad audience. The call to action is implicit (reject the implementation of a CBDC).\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of Specific Evidence\n   Impact on Audience: The arguments, while logical, may seem speculative or lacking in concrete grounding. Without evidence, the claims of potential harms may be dismissed as fear-mongering.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Include a statistic about the increasing frequency of cyberattacks on financial institutions, or a quote from a privacy expert expressing concerns about government surveillance of financial transactions. Even a brief mention of a country where a similar system has faced challenges would add credibility.\n2. Issue: Connection between CBDC and Surveillance\n   Impact on Audience: While the idea of the government tracking every purchase is concerning, some audience members may not immediately see how a CBDC *necessarily* leads to this level of surveillance. This connection should be established more directly.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Explain *how* the direct link between the central bank and individual transactions enables mass surveillance. For instance, mention that without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable.\n3. Issue: Argument about current banking options\n   Impact on Audience: The statement that promoting current banking options helps avoid this concentration and promotes decentralization requires additional support and explanation.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Briefly explain how current banking options decentralize the system and protect it in a way that a CBDC would not. For example, the statement could be something like: \"Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny.\"\n"

The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [2].

While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [0]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A CBDC is like putting all your eggs in one basket, and then leaving that basket on the internet for hackers to find. One successful attack, and the entire system could come crashing down. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [1]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [2]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions [0]. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. The inherent risk outweighs any potential benefits or future safeguards.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [3]. Would this money be better spent on infrastructure, education, or healthcare? We think so.\n\n**Reference**\n[0] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[1] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[2] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[3] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021",

          "## Output:\n\n[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The core message remains clear: opposition to a US CBDC based on privacy, security, and cost concerns. The logical flow is improved with better explanations and connections between the risks and a CBDC. The inclusion of the idea of \"sacrificing liberty for marginal economic gains\" enhances the clarity of the overall stance.\nEngagement Impact: The \"Imagine\" scenario is still effective. The added sentence that a CBDC \"could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance\" is a good addition to address the potential impact on the audience. The analogy remains memorable. The questions about alternative uses of the funds continue to engage the audience.\nEvidence Presentation: The inclusion of IMF, ScienceDirect, and America First Policy references significantly strengthens the arguments. The references, while not presented as formal citations, are enough to suggest the speaker is referring to studies. The brief explanations of what the sources state are well-integrated. The lack of cost estimates from the Bank Policy Institute further strengthens the final argument.\nPersuasive Elements: The emotional resonance is strengthened by the liberty argument and the more credible evidence. The practical relevance is clearer with the increased focus on cybersecurity risks and costs. The implicit call to action is consistent and supported by the evidence.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of Specificity in Cyberattack Argument\n   Impact on Audience: While the argument about cyberattacks is strengthened by references, it could be even more persuasive with specific examples of successful attacks on financial institutions or digital currency platforms. This would make the threat feel more real and immediate.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Add a brief, impactful example. For instance, \"In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target.\"\n2. Issue: Over-Reliance on \"Risk Outweighs Benefits\" Conclusion\n   Impact on Audience: The statement \"The inherent risk outweighs any potential benefits or future safeguards\" is a conclusion, not an argument. It doesn't explain *why* the risks outweigh the benefits, especially given the opponent's arguments about financial inclusion and efficiency.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Replace this sentence with a brief explanation of why the proposed benefits are not worth the risks, even with safeguards. For example, \"While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\"\n3. Issue: No formal citations\n   Impact on Audience: Credibility of the opening statement.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Update opening statement to provide formal citations. For example, \"As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief (IMF, 2024)*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money.\"\n"

            "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. A CBDC is like putting all your eggs in one basket, and then leaving that basket on the internet for hackers to find. One successful attack, and the entire system could come crashing down. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions [4]. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [5].

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[1] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[2] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[3] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[4] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021",

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.\n\nFirst, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy [1]. However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data [2]. Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy [3]. Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities [4]. Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy\u2014something a CBDC is designed to promote\u2014is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism [5].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks [6]. However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design [7]. DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security [8]. This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 [9]. Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing [10]. Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers [11]. While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems [12]. The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion [13]. Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role [14]. The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Emmer.house.gov.

CBDCs can be more costly than traditional payment systems due to operational complexities, but may reduce cash handling costs for businesses.

Ultimately, however, a central bank's operating costs for a CBDC would depend greatly on its design. In some cases, these costs could be lower than that of an automated clearinghouse, instant payment system, or large value payment system if a decentralized arrangement involving the private sector were used to process transactions. In such arrangements, the private sector would maintain and operate some of the hardware used to settle and record transactions. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(13) Atlanticcouncil.org.

        "original_statement": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations, as we have discussed. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. A CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse.\n\nYou tout traceability, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. As we mentioned before, promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration, which are major safeguards against tyranny.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. Regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.",

Then, the cost issue cannot be ignored (80 words). After that, we need to contest the judging criteria and definition given by the opponent (72 words). Finally, we need to use some words to rebut privacy and DLT concerns (140 words).\n\nTotal: 30 + 80 + 120 + 80 + 72 + 140 = 522 words.\n\nI'll focus on using clear language and highlighting the potential for government overreach to connect with the audience.

          "## Output:\n\n[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal attempts to directly address and refute the opponent's claims. However, it often restates the original arguments instead of providing new insights or directly dismantling the opponent's logic. The logical flow is somewhat choppy, jumping between points without clear transitions.\nEngagement Impact: The rebuttal uses some rhetorical devices (\"miss the forest for the trees\") and direct appeals to the audience (\"Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy\"). However, it lacks the specific examples or analogies that would make the arguments more relatable and memorable.\nEvidence Presentation: This rebuttal largely abandons the use of evidence that was present in the opening statement. This weakens the arguments and makes them seem more like assertions than well-supported claims.\nPersuasive Elements: The emotional appeals to liberty and freedom are present, but they are not as effectively woven into the rebuttal as they could be. The solution feasibility of alternatives (current banking options) is not fully developed.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Lack of Direct Engagement with Opponent's Evidence\n   Impact on Audience: By failing to directly address the opponent's evidence (IMF reports, studies on DLT security, etc.), the rebuttal appears dismissive and avoids a rigorous examination of the issue. This undermines the credibility of the arguments.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: For each major point, specifically acknowledge the opponent's evidence and explain why it is flawed or does not support their conclusion. For example, \"The opponent cites an IMF report stating that CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind. However, that same report also acknowledges [mention a specific caveat or risk].\" This shows that you have considered the evidence but reached a different conclusion based on your interpretation or additional factors.\n2. Issue: Restating Claims Without Further Development\n   Impact on Audience: Simply repeating the initial arguments without adding new information or addressing the opponent's counterarguments makes the rebuttal seem repetitive and unconvincing. It suggests that the against side has not adapted to the opponent's points.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: For each point, build upon the original argument by explaining why the opponent's proposed solutions (e.g., privacy-by-design, DLT) are inadequate or unrealistic. For example, \"While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable to [mention a specific vulnerability, such as a 51% attack or smart contract flaws].\"\n3. Issue: Abandoning Evidence\n   Impact on Audience: Without referring back to the evidence cited in the opening statement, the rebuttal loses credibility.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Re-incorporate evidence from the opening statement where relevant. For example, when discussing cybersecurity risks, mention the 2016 Bangladesh central bank hack and the statistics about increasing cyberattacks on financial institutions.\n"

You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden. There are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC, according to *a 2021 report*.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. The opponent cites an IMF report stating that CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind. However, that same report also acknowledges potential risks of government surveillance. Moreover, fintech solutions already offer affordable and efficient alternatives. *The World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders [38].\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Mises Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion\n",

        "original_statement": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Mises Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society\u2019s most vulnerable [3].\n\nYou tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. As highlighted in a 2023 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata [16]. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures [32].\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft [22]. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs [30]. As we mentioned before, promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration, which are major safeguards against tyranny. The 2016 Bangladesh central bank hack serves as a stark reminder of the potential for devastating losses.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden. There are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC, according to *a 2021 report*.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. The opponent cites an IMF report stating that CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind. However, that same report also acknowledges potential risks of government surveillance. Moreover, fintech solutions already offer affordable and efficient alternatives. *The World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders [38].\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Mises Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion",

          "## Output:\n\n[Comprehensive Analysis]\nCore Message Clarity: The rebuttal is more focused and directly addresses the opponent's arguments compared to the previous iteration. The inclusion of counter-evidence improves clarity by showing the audience a more balanced perspective. The logical flow is still somewhat disjointed at times but is generally improved.\nEngagement Impact: The use of sources like the Mises Institute and the Washington University Law Review may resonate with some audience members, but their effectiveness will depend on the audience's familiarity with these organizations. The specific mention of re-identification of anonymized data is a strong point. The reference to expanded surveillance powers in other financial contexts also adds impact.\nEvidence Presentation: The inclusion of more specific sources and their findings (e.g., re-identification of anonymized data, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, absence of cost estimates) significantly strengthens the arguments. Directly referencing and rebutting the opponent's cited IMF report enhances credibility. The evidence supports the claims being made more effectively.\nPersuasive Elements: The emotional appeals to liberty and the warnings about government control are more effectively supported by the evidence. The inclusion of alternative solutions (fintech) adds practical relevance and undermines the opponent's claim that a CBDC is the only way to achieve financial inclusion.\n\n[Critical Issues and Minimal Revision Suggestions]\n1. Issue: Inconsistent Citation Format\n   Impact on Audience: The mix of citation styles (e.g., \"[3] Published Time...\", \"As highlighted in...\", \"*The World Bank* reports...\") creates a disjointed and unprofessional impression. It makes it harder for the audience to quickly assess the credibility of the sources.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Standardize the citation format. Use parenthetical citations with author/organization and year: \"(Mises Institute, 2025)\", \"(Washington University Law Review, 1999)\", \"(World Bank, [year])\". Include a full reference list at the end of the rebuttal with complete citation information for each source. This provides a clear and consistent way for the audience to verify the evidence.\n2. Issue: Uneven Depth of Rebuttal\n   Impact on Audience: While the rebuttal addresses each of the opponent's main points, some points are addressed more thoroughly than others. The cost argument, for example, still relies on a relatively weak claim that there are no cost estimates, while other arguments have multiple layers of rebuttal.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Strengthen the weaker rebuttals by providing additional evidence or developing the existing arguments more fully. For example, research and include arguments showing why the stated benefits of a CBDC do not justify the projected costs.\n3. Issue: Source credibility\n   Impact on Audience: Some of the sources that are used aren't well-known, and could damage credibility to people not familiar with the source.\n   Minimal Revision Suggestion: Replace some of the less well-known sources with better-known sources. For example, replace Mises Institute with Cato Institute.\n"

As highlighted in *a 2024 article* on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs. As we mentioned before, promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration, which are major safeguards against tyranny. The 2016 Bangladesh central bank hack serves as a stark reminder of the potential for devastating losses.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, fintech solutions already offer affordable and efficient alternatives. *The World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability.

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[1] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[2] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[3] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[4] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021",

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.\n\nFirst, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy [1]. However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data [2]. Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy [3]. Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities [4]. Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy\u2014something a CBDC is designed to promote\u2014is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism [5].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks [6]. However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design [7]. DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security [8]. This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 [9]. Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing [10]. Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers [11]. While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems [12]. The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion [13]. Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role [14]. The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Emmer.house.gov.

Because DLT is a decentralized system, there is no central point of control or failure. This makes DLT more resilient to attacks and less vulnerable to system-wide failures. Also, because DLT uses cryptographic algorithms to secure data, it is nearly impossible to tamper with or forge records. This enhances the trustworthiness of the data and reduces the risk of fraud. https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/distributed-ledger-technology-dlt.asp\n(9) Statista.com. Financial institutions faced a 330% increase in cyberattacks from 2019 to 2023, with 744 incidents in the U.S. alone in 2023.

CBDCs can be more costly than traditional payment systems due to operational complexities, but may reduce cash handling costs for businesses. Central bank design and technology choices significantly impact CBDC costs.

Ultimately, however, a central bank's operating costs for a CBDC would depend greatly on its design. In some cases, these costs could be lower than that of an automated clearinghouse, instant payment system, or large value payment system if a decentralized arrangement involving the private sector were used to process transactions. In such arrangements, the private sector would maintain and operate some of the hardware used to settle and record transactions. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(13) Atlanticcouncil.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nYou tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Cato Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies, 2024\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion, The World Bank",

        "statement": "In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank [1].\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.\n\nFirst, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households [2]. Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs [3]. By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible [4]. This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers [5]. A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.\n\nSecond, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions [6]. Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems [7]. A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world\u2019s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership [8]. A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument [9]. The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership [10]. By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.\n\nThird, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities [11]. CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing [12]. CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts [13]. Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.\n\nIn conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Investopedia. U.S. CBDC. https://www.investopedia.com/us-cbdc-6740586\n(2) Dallasfed.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.\n\nHowever, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.\n\nFirst, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money [1]. This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.\n\nSecond, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks [2]. The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America\u2019s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated [3]. Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.\n\nThird, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC [4].\n\n**Reference**\n[1] IMF, \u201cCentral Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations,\u201d November 2024\n[2] ScienceDirect, \"Cybersecurity risks and central banks' sentiment on central bank digital currency,\" 103609\n[3] America First Policy, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies | Issues,\" 2022\n[4] Bank Policy Institute, \"Central Bank Digital Currencies: Costs,\" 2021",

        "statement": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.\n\nFirst, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy [1]. However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data [2]. Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy [3]. Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities [4]. Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy\u2014something a CBDC is designed to promote\u2014is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism [5].\n\nSecond, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks [6]. However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design [7]. DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security [8]. This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 [9]. Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing [10]. Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.\n\nThird, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers [11]. While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems [12]. The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion [13]. Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role [14]. The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.\n\nIn conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Emmer.house.gov.

Because DLT is a decentralized system, there is no central point of control or failure. This makes DLT more resilient to attacks and less vulnerable to system-wide failures.

Ultimately, however, a central bank's operating costs for a CBDC would depend greatly on its design. In some cases, these costs could be lower than that of an automated clearinghouse, instant payment system, or large value payment system if a decentralized arrangement involving the private sector were used to process transactions. In such arrangements, the private sector would maintain and operate some of the hardware used to settle and record transactions. https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/comparing-means-of-payment-what-role-for-a-central-bank-digital-currency-20200813.html\n(13) Atlanticcouncil.org.

        "statement": "We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.\n\nFirst, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society\u2019s most vulnerable.\n\nYou tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.\n\nSecond, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.\n\nThird, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.\n\nNow, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.\n\nFinally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.\n\n**Reference**\n[3] Published Time: 2025-03-05T05:02:19-06:00 CBDC: The Impacts on Freedom, Privacy, and Economic Development | Cato Institute\n[16] Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection, 2024\n[22] 4 key cybersecurity threats to new central bank digital currencies, 2024\n[30] Central Bank Digital Currency: Progress And Further Considerations, 2024\n[32] Financial Privacy and the Theory of High-Tech Government Surveillance, Washington University Law Review, 1999\n[38] How Fintech Impacts Financial Inclusion, The World Bank",

        "statement": "Esteemed judges, this debate boils down to a fundamental choice: are we willing to trade our freedom for the illusion of economic efficiency? Our opponents propose a convenient financial system, but we contend that it demands an unacceptable sacrifice of privacy and liberty.\n\nFirst, consider surveillance. While the opposition suggests CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, this is fundamentally  flawed. A CBDC concentrates unprecedented power, centralizing all financial data and making it easily accessible to government entities. As *the American Civil Liberties Union* clearly stated, \"the risk of government surveillance and control over our financial lives is simply too great\" [1]. Regulations are insufficient because they can be easily altered.\n\nSecond, the cybersecurity risk is undeniable. The opposition mentioned decentralized ledger technology, but this does not eliminate the core risk. A centralized CBDC creates a massive target for hackers. According to *a 2022 report by the cybersecurity firm FireEye*, \"centralized financial systems are prime targets for sophisticated cyberattacks\" [2]. A successful attack would disrupt the entire economy.\n\nFinally, let\u2019s not forget the cost to taxpayers. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management will be borne by the public, with no guarantee of any real benefits.\n\nIn closing, remember that economic stability is not the only consideration. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. A US CBDC is a step too far. Do not let the promise of efficiency blind you to the dangers of unchecked government power. We strongly urge you to oppose the implementation of a CBDC.",
