      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that banning certain inappropriate books\u2014defined as books containing explicit depictions or promotion of sexual activity, violence, or drug use that are not age-appropriate for school-aged children\u2014in schools is a necessary measure to protect the well-being of students.\n\nOur judging criteria is based on which side best protects the well-being of students, both physically and psychologically. Banning inappropriate books directly contributes to this standard by mitigating potential harm from exposure to explicit and harmful content, thereby fulfilling the school's responsibility to provide a safe and supportive learning environment.\n\nFirst, exposure to explicit content can lead to negative psychological effects. Research indicates that early exposure to sexually graphic material is likely to have a negative influence and a potentially harmful impact on children [1]. A review of studies published between 1995 and 2015 found that the use of sexually explicit material among adolescents was associated with more permissive sexual attitudes and behaviors, including sexually aggressive behavior [2]. Furthermore, the American Academy of Pediatrics has found that exposure to violence in media can lead to children acting aggressively and becoming desensitized to violence [3]. Banning inappropriate books reduces the risk of such harm, thereby safeguarding the psychological well-being of students.\n\nSecond, upholding parental rights is paramount. The Harris Poll indicated that 60% of people surveyed believed that children should not have access in school libraries to books containing explicit language [4]. Writer Macey France noted that opting a child out of reading a certain book doesn't protect them if other students are exposed to the material [5]. Senator Ryan Aument\u2019s SB 7 bill in Pennsylvania seeks to require schools to notify parents if curriculum or library books contain sexually explicit content and requires parents to opt-in to allow their children to access the material [6]. Banning inappropriate books allows parents to have more control over the material their children are exposed to in school, aligning with their right to guide their children's education and protect them from content that conflicts with their values.\n\nThird, maintaining a safe and supportive learning environment is crucial for academic success. Inappropriate books can be disruptive and create discomfort among students. For example, books like \"Thirteen Reasons Why,\" which revolves around teen suicide, and \"Gender Queer: A Memoir\" have been frequently challenged in schools due to their mature themes [7]. The presence of such books can detract from the educational mission. A First Book study revealed that 81 percent of educators believe that conversations around banned books and restrictions to book access harm students [8]. By banning these books, schools can foster a more positive and focused learning atmosphere, prioritizing a learning environment that promotes student well-being and academic success.\n\nIn conclusion, banning certain inappropriate books in schools is essential for protecting students from negative psychological effects, upholding parental rights, and maintaining a safe learning environment. Therefore, we strongly affirm the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Protectkidsonline.ca.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue against the motion that certain \"inappropriate\" books, defined as those containing depictions of sex, violence, or drug use, should be banned from schools. We contend that such bans constitute censorship, which we define as the suppression or prohibition of speech or expression considered objectionable.\n\nOur judging criteria is upholding intellectual freedom and educational value. We believe the side that best demonstrates how their position fosters intellectual freedom, promotes critical thinking, and provides students with access to diverse perspectives while minimizing potential harms, should win the debate. We argue that banning books fails this criteria, leading to a less informed and less tolerant student body.\n\nFirst, banning books limits intellectual freedom and critical thinking. Restricting access to diverse perspectives stifles students' ability to analyze complex issues and form their own opinions. Censorship undermines the educational process by preventing students from engaging with challenging ideas and developing critical thinking skills. Research indicates that intellectual freedom, encompassing the freedom to read, express, and know, is vital for a well-rounded education [1]. Opponents of book bans argue that restricting information and discouraging freedom of thought undermine one of the primary functions of education: teaching students how to think for themselves [2]. By shielding students from controversial topics, we hinder their ability to navigate the complexities of the real world and prepare them for informed participation in a democratic society. Therefore, banning books undermines the core educational mission.\n\nSecond, book bans disproportionately affect marginalized voices and perspectives. Challenges to books often target works by or about people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups, further marginalizing these communities [3]. This creates a biased learning environment where certain voices are silenced and students are denied the opportunity to learn about diverse experiences and perspectives. For example, challenges to books often cite violence or religious viewpoints [4], demonstrating a tendency to suppress content that challenges dominant norms. This censorship not only harms marginalized students by erasing their experiences but also deprives all students of the opportunity to develop empathy and understanding for different cultures and identities. Thus, banning these books perpetuates harmful biases and undermines efforts to create inclusive and equitable schools.\n\nThird, alternative approaches, such as parental guidance and age-appropriate discussions, are more effective than outright bans. Open dialogue and critical evaluation of materials, guided by parents and educators, foster media literacy and critical thinking skills. Instead of shielding students from potentially sensitive content, we should empower them to engage with it critically and responsibly. These approaches teach students how to analyze information, identify bias, and form their own informed opinions [1]. According to the American Library Association, challenges to books often cite concerns about violence or religious viewpoints [4]. Instead of banning books, schools can create diverse, inclusive curricula and promote open discussions about challenging topics. By fostering critical thinking and media literacy, we equip students with the tools they need to navigate complex issues and make informed decisions.\n\nIn conclusion, we stand against the banning of \"inappropriate\" books in schools. Such bans limit intellectual freedom, disproportionately affect marginalized voices, and are less effective than alternative approaches. We urge you to uphold intellectual freedom and educational value by rejecting this motion.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oberg, D. (2024).

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws regarding definitions, intellectual freedom, and the marginalization of sensitive content, which we will address in turn.\n\nFirst, the opposition defines banning books as \"censorship,\" implying suppression of all objectionable expression. However, our proposal is not about blanket censorship; it's about curating a safe and age-appropriate learning environment. We define \"inappropriate books\" using community standards and legal precedents concerning obscenity and age appropriateness. Removing materials that meet these criteria is curation, not censorship. Just as museums curate their collections to display appropriate and relevant art, schools can curate their libraries to offer valuable and suitable reading material [7]. Therefore, the claim that we advocate for censorship is simply untrue.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that banning books limits intellectual freedom and critical thinking. This assumes that unrestricted access to all information automatically fosters critical thinking, but that is a false equivalence. Critical thinking is best developed through guided discussions of age-appropriate material. For example, teaching a child calculus before they grasp basic arithmetic doesn't enhance their understanding; it overwhelms them. Studies show that exposure to violence in media, including in books, can lead to increased aggression and desensitization in adolescents [3, 10]. By curating the content available, we ensure that students engage with complex ideas in a supportive and developmentally appropriate way, maximizing their ability to think critically.\n\nThird, the opposition claims that book bans disproportionately affect marginalized voices and perspectives. While this is a valid concern, our focus is on the content of the books, not the authors. We agree that marginalized voices are vital. However, some books are challenged based on their content. Additionally, parental rights are already in place in school districts as well as the school library; if a parent is concerned about the material, they can already monitor the material their children have access to [6]. Our goal is to protect children and ensure a safe learning environment.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Violence Exposure and the Development of School-Related Functioning. *PMC*, 2013.\n(2) The Impact of Book Banning in Schools. *American University*, 2024.\n(3) Social media brings benefits and risks to teens.

      "content": "Thank you chair person. A steam judges ladies and gentlemen. The affirmatives rebuttal contains five critical flaws. The redefinition of censorship. They're over emphasis on safety at the expense of diverse perspectives. They're underestimation of children's capacity for critical thinking. They're dismissal of parental guidance. And they're unsupported claim that banning books enhances intellectual freedom. First the affirmative attempts to redefine banning books as responsible curation. But this is simply a euphemism for censorship. Censorship by definition is the suppression or prohibition of ideas and information that are considered objectionable. Removing books from schools based on their content regardless of the justification. Fit squarely within this definition the american library association. Has track challenges to books for decades and consistently highlights the harm of censorship. In limiting access to diverse perspectives. This so-called curation. Inevitably involves suppressing certain viewpoints especially those of marginalized communities. And restricting student's ability to engage with a wide range of ideas. The impact of this censorship is that it leaves students less informed. Less tolerant and less prepared for the complexities of the real world. While we agree that student well-being is important it should not come at the cost of limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. The affirmative creates a false dichotomy. My suggesting that we must choose between safety and intellectual freedom. In reality it is possible to protect students and provide them with access to a wide range of voices and experiences exposure to diverse literature fosters empathy understanding. And critical thinking for. The affirmative claims that they are only removing graphic content. But this definition is often subjective. And can be used to target books that deal with difficult topics in a responsible and age appropriate way. Furthermore this argument does not protect marginalized students who might need the content of the books being removed. We cannot protect some students while leaving others behind. The affirmative underestimates children's capacity for critical thinking. Shielding children from harmful content. Can actually hinder their intellectual and emotional development. Engaging with challenging ideas even at a young age. Help students develop critical thinking skills and learn to navigate complex issues 5. By censoring books we deprive students of the opportunity to grapple with difficult topics analyze different perspectives. And form their own informed opinions. This overprotection can leave them unprepared for the realities of the world. Unless able to cope with challenging situations. They do not have data regarding the risks of over protection. We acknowledge their data regarding self-harm but point out that we must teach students coping mechanisms for the real world. Fourth the affirmative dismisses parental guidance as insufficient. But this overlooks the crucial role that parents play in shaping their children's values and beliefs. While we acknowledge that not all parents are equally equipped or willing to guide their children's reading choices. Schools should work to empower parents not replace them. Furthermore. Curating inappropriate content also limits the ability for open discussion with parents. If children do not know about the content. They will not know to reach out for help. If this information is readily available. It can be discussed and the schools and parents can work together. Finally the affirmative claims that curating books creates a safer learning environment that ultimately enhances intellectual freedom and educational value.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) ACE, Association of College and Research Libraries. \"The definition of book banning\", 2024.\n(2) First Amendment Encyclopedia. \"Book Banning\". https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/book-banning/\n(3) AP. \"Challenges to library books continue at record pace in 2023, American Library Association reports\". 8 News Now, 2024.\n(4) Harvard Graduate School of Education. \"Book Bans and the Librarians Who Won\u2019t Be Hushed\". 2023.\n(5) Oberg, D. \"Intellectual Freedom Rights for Students in Our Schools.\" *Computers in Libraries*, 2024.\n(6) Violence Exposure and the Development of School-Related Functioning. *PMC*, 2013."

The core contention raised by the opposition is that our stance equates to censorship. We firmly disagree. Our focus is on responsible curation not suppression. We aim to provide age-appropriate materials ensuring a safe learning environment. The narrow definition of inappropriate books those containing graphic depictions or promoting sexual activity violence or illegal drug use. Clarifies that this is not a blanket ban on ideas. But a specific measure related to potentially harmful content. Just like libraries have criteria for selecting books. Our approach ensures materials aligned with community standards and legal precedence which the opposition seems to ignore 7. This brings us to the false dichotomy between safety and intellectual freedom. We argue that a safe environment is a precondition for intellectual freedom. Students cannot effectively engage with complex ideas if they feel unsafe or are exposed to harmful content. Exposure to content such as graphic violence can directly harm psychological well-being hindering intellectual development. As pmc shows children exposed to violence may exhibit neurological changes. Impacting memory and self-regulation 6. We also suggest that schools follow guidelines from organizations such as the american academy of pediatrics that provides guidelines on media use for children. While we acknowledge the importance of diverse perspectives. And that our definition of graphic content may contain subjectivity. Are priorities student well-being. That is why our definition is rooted in community standards and legal precedence not arbitrary decisions 7.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the core principles of censorship versus curation, the balance between student safety and intellectual freedom, and the most effective methods for fostering critical thinking in our schools.\n\nThe opposition attempts to reframe banning books as \"responsible curation\" [1]. However, regardless of intent, the effect remains censorship: the suppression of ideas [2]. Even well-intentioned curation can become censorship if certain viewpoints are excluded, especially those of marginalized communities. Our opponents create a false dichotomy by suggesting we must choose between safety and intellectual freedom. In reality, these values are not mutually exclusive; a well-rounded education necessitates both [3]. Exposure to diverse literature fosters empathy and critical thinking [4]. The affirmative's subjective definition of \"graphic content\" can easily target books addressing important social issues, silencing marginalized voices [5]. We believe that shielding children from challenging topics hinders their ability to develop critical thinking skills [6].\n\nWe recognize the importance of protecting children from genuinely harmful content. However, the vast majority of challenged books do not fall into this category. The alternative isn't reckless exposure but context and age-appropriate discussions [3]. We point out that alternative coping mechanisms exist for real world [4].\n\nWhile the opposition dismisses parental guidance as insufficient, parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's values. Schools should empower parents, not replace them. Banning books also limits the opportunity for open discussion and critical engagement [3].
