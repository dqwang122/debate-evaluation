      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling, a legislative limit on the amount of national debt the U.S. Treasury can incur. We define \"abolish\" as formally putting an end to the system, practice, or institution of the debt ceiling.\n\nOur judging criteria is the promotion of economic stability and efficient governance. We contend that the debt ceiling, while intended to promote fiscal responsibility, has repeatedly created economic instability and political gridlock. Abolishing it will lead to a more stable economic environment where the government can reliably meet its obligations and focus on long-term economic growth.\n\nFirst, the debt ceiling creates unnecessary economic instability and uncertainty. The debt ceiling has repeatedly led to political standoffs and threats of default, which negatively impact financial markets and the overall economy. For instance, the 2011 debt ceiling crisis led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, resulting in increased borrowing costs for the government and businesses [1]. A report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) found that the 2011 debt ceiling impasse resulted in billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs [2]. Eliminating the debt ceiling would remove this recurring source of instability and prevent future economic damage. According to a CNN article in June 2023, reforms that make future standoffs less risky would be a \"positive\" from a credit ratings perspective [3]. By removing the debt ceiling, we are actively securing the U.S. credit rating and avoiding needless economic damage.\n\nSecond, the debt ceiling does not effectively control government spending. The debt ceiling is a poor tool for fiscal discipline, as it only addresses the *result* of spending decisions, not the decisions themselves. Congress still has the power to set the budget, and the debt ceiling simply creates a potential crisis when the government needs to pay its bills. The debt ceiling has not achieved its stated goal of imposing fiscal discipline on Congress. The statutory debt ceiling is a completely arbitrary value, there has never been any economic justification for any of its historical values [4]. A New York Times article argues that the debt ceiling has not served a useful purpose in living memory [5]. Congress can implement other fiscal restraints that provide more direct oversight and impact on fiscal policy.\n\nThird, abolishing the debt ceiling would streamline government operations and reduce political gridlock. The debt ceiling process consumes significant time and resources, diverting attention from more pressing economic issues. It also provides opportunities for political posturing and gridlock, hindering the government's ability to address important challenges. Louise Sheiner, in her testimony to the House Budget Committee, argued that the debt ceiling distracts from real, tangible economic challenges [6]. Freeing Congress from these manufactured crises would allow them to focus on actual economic policies that bolster the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the debt ceiling causes unnecessary economic instability, fails to control government spending, and fosters political gridlock. Abolishing the debt ceiling will promote economic stability, improve government efficiency, and allow policymakers to focus on addressing real economic challenges. For these reasons, we strongly affirm the resolution: Congress should abolish the debt ceiling.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) U.S. Government Accountability Office.

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that **Congress should not abolish the debt ceiling**. The debt ceiling is defined as a legislative limit on the amount of national debt that the U.S. Treasury can incur, effectively limiting the amount of money the federal government can borrow [4]. It serves as a tool to control government spending and maintain fiscal responsibility.\n\nOur judging criteria is **fiscal stability and responsibility**. The most desirable outcome is one that ensures long-term fiscal stability, promotes responsible government spending, and avoids economic crises. We contend that maintaining the debt ceiling, while imperfect, is more likely to achieve this stability than abolishing it.\n\nFirst, **the debt ceiling acts as a necessary check on excessive government spending**. While it may occasionally lead to political standoffs, the debt ceiling forces Congress to confront the implications of its spending decisions. Economist Veronique de Rugy from the National Review argues that removing the debt ceiling eliminates a major check on government, emphasizing that the federal budget is already in a \"horrible mess,\" and Congress is to blame [7]. The debt ceiling provides a mechanism for oversight and encourages fiscal accountability, which would be lost if it were abolished.\n\nSecond, **abolishing the debt ceiling significantly increases the risk of economic instability**. Multiple sources highlight the potential dangers of removing this fiscal restraint. The Economic Policy Institute (EPI) warns that abolishing the debt ceiling could lead to economic recession, financial market disruptions, and higher borrowing costs [1]. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget (CRFB) echoes these concerns, stating that removing the debt ceiling could lead to default, higher interest rates, and severe economic downturn [2]. Brookings adds that eliminating the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. Treasuries and trigger a financial crisis [1]. These are not theoretical risks; they are concrete threats to the stability of the U.S. and global economies.\n\nThird, **viable alternatives exist to improve fiscal responsibility without resorting to abolishing the debt ceiling altogether**. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recommends that Congress consider immediately replacing the current process with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions at the time they are made [8]. The CRFB proposes other alternatives, such as granting the President authority to increase the debt limit if specific fiscal targets are met, or indexing the debt limit to GDP growth [8]. These alternatives offer a more nuanced approach to fiscal management, preserving a degree of oversight and accountability without the drastic consequences of abolishment.\n\nIn conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal stability and economic well-being. It removes a necessary check on government spending and increases the likelihood of economic instability. More responsible and effective solutions exist to address the challenges of fiscal management. Therefore, we strongly advocate against abolishing the debt ceiling.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) EPI. \"Abolish the debt ceiling before it commits austerity again: The GOP used the debt ceiling to force spending cuts in 2011.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition's arguments rest on a flawed premise: that the debt ceiling is a necessary tool for fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that it undermines fiscal responsibility and introduces more problems than it solves. We will address their claims about fiscal responsibility, investor confidence, and prioritization of government services.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that abolishing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial check on government spending, fostering fiscal irresponsibility. However, economic stability is actually a prerequisite for responsible fiscal policy. The debt ceiling undermines this stability, making responsible fiscal planning even more challenging. The Government Accountability Office found that the 2011 debt ceiling crisis resulted in billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs [1]. It\u2019s hard to be fiscally responsible when the debt ceiling needlessly makes things more expensive. Michael Ettlinger from the Economic Policy Institute notes that the debt ceiling is arbitrary and lacks economic justification [4]. The opposition is essentially saying we need the debt ceiling to force fiscal discipline, but as we've shown, the debt ceiling itself makes us less fiscally sound.\n\nSecond, they claim that eliminating the debt ceiling will erode investor confidence in U.S. debt. But the debt ceiling itself is a recurring source of instability that harms investor confidence. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis, which led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, shows that the debt ceiling actually undermines investor confidence [1]. It also causes massive market uncertainty. Francis, an executive at Fitch Ratings, stated that reforms making future standoffs less risky would be a \"positive\" from a credit ratings perspective [2]. Therefore, abolishing the debt ceiling would increase, not decrease, investor confidence by removing the risk of manufactured crises.\n\nThird, our opponents argue that the debt ceiling forces Congress to prioritize essential government services. Congress must make spending choices during the budget process with or without the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling only distracts from real economic challenges. As Louise Sheiner testified to the House Budget Committee, the debt ceiling distracts from tangible economic challenges [6]. It does not help to address them. While the negative might claim we want to spend recklessly, this is a strawman. Abolishing the debt ceiling will not eliminate prioritization. It will just mean that we prioritize in a more effective and rational way.\n\nIn conclusion, the debt ceiling fails to promote fiscal responsibility, harms investor confidence, and hinders effective prioritization of government services. Abolishing it will promote economic stability, improve government efficiency, and allow policymakers to focus on addressing real economic challenges. For these reasons, we maintain our strong support for the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) U.S. Government Accountability Office.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition attempts to paint a rosy picture of a world without the debt ceiling, but their arguments are based on short-sightedness and a misunderstanding of fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that the debt ceiling, while imperfect, is a crucial tool for maintaining economic stability in the long run. We will address their claims about fiscal responsibility, investor confidence, and prioritization of government services.\n\nFirst, the opposition claims the debt ceiling undermines fiscal responsibility and makes things more expensive, citing increased borrowing costs during the 2011 crisis. However, they commit a logical fallacy by focusing solely on the short-term instability caused by debt ceiling debates while ignoring the potential for long-term fiscal irresponsibility. While these debates may cause temporary market jitters, *true* fiscal responsibility requires tools to prevent excessive government spending [3]. As Veronique de Rugy notes in *National Review*, eliminating the debt ceiling removes a major check on government, and \"the bottom line is that the federal budget is a horrible mess, and Congress is to blame for it\" [7]. We acknowledge the instability caused by the debt ceiling, but the alternative\u2014uncontrolled spending\u2014is equally, if not *more*, unstable in the long run, burdening future generations with unsustainable debt.\n\nSecond, they argue the debt ceiling harms investor confidence, pointing to the 2011 downgrade. But the debt ceiling is a *necessary evil*. While it can lead to short-term market fluctuations, it ultimately signals to investors that the U.S. government is committed to fiscal discipline, even if that commitment is sometimes tested. As the *World Economic Forum* points out, only a handful of countries employ a debt ceiling to \"signal fiscal discipline to their lenders and investors,\" demonstrating its value as a credible commitment [2]. Eliminating this signal could be interpreted as a lack of commitment to managing debt responsibly, undermining long-term investor confidence and potentially leading to higher borrowing costs. Therefore, while there are short-term risks, there are significant long-term benefits to investor confidence with the debt ceiling present.\n\nThird, our opponents argue that the debt ceiling distracts from real economic challenges, but the debt ceiling *forces* Congress to confront these challenges head-on. Rather than distracting, it creates a moment of reckoning where lawmakers must seriously consider the nation's financial health and make difficult decisions. The claim that abolishing the debt ceiling will automatically lead to more effective and rational prioritization is a fallacy. Without the pressure of the debt ceiling, Congress is likely to continue its pattern of unchecked spending, jeopardizing the nation's economic future. Getting rid of the debt ceiling would eliminate a major check on the government [7]. A breach of the debt limit would mean stopping payments to programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, child nutrition programs, and others [2]. As such, it is critical to prioritize and consider the essential needs of our citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, the debt ceiling fosters fiscal prioritization and is a necessary evil that promotes fiscal discipline and ultimately increases investor confidence. Abolishing it carries significant risks, including economic recession, financial market disruptions, and increased borrowing costs [1]. We stand firm in our opposition to abolishing the debt ceiling.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Abolishing the debt ceiling could lead to economic recession, financial market disruptions, and higher borrowing costs.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the economic stability, fiscal responsibility, and government efficiency related to the debt ceiling.\n\nThe core clash centers on whether the debt ceiling promotes or undermines economic stability and investor confidence. Our opponents suggest it signals fiscal discipline, but we've demonstrated it's a recurring source of instability. The 2011 downgrade and Fitch's statement [1, 2] prove reforms reducing standoffs are viewed positively. The debt ceiling causes brinkmanship, which harms the economy. By removing this risk, we increase investor confidence, since it removes a *source* of instability rather than attempting to manage the symptoms. The idea that investors value the *potential* for crisis over *actual* stability is simply irrational.\n\nNext, we must consider fiscal responsibility and government spending. Our opponents believe the debt ceiling is the only thing preventing reckless spending. This is false. The debt ceiling addresses the *result* of spending, not the cause. Budget processes, while imperfect, are a more direct means of control. As Michael Ettlinger from the Economic Policy Institute notes, the debt ceiling is arbitrary [4]. We aren't advocating for reckless spending, just a more rational process. Moreover, the negative has stated that those who want to constrain spending do not enjoy the leverage conferred on coalitions built to protect the status quo. However, these processes are already in place and do not require additional confusion.\n\nFinally, consider political gridlock and government efficiency. The debt ceiling leads to artificial and damaging gridlock. As Louise Sheiner testified [6], it distracts from real economic challenges and prevents addressing important issues. The debt ceiling debates are manufactured crises serving political purposes rather than promoting good governance.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) U.S. Government Accountability Office.

The opposition suggests budget resolutions are sufficient. But the baker institute states that these measures have proven ineffective. They also argue that the debt ceiling increases borrowing costs and is arbitrary. However the government accountability office report they cite doesn't explicitly state that the debt ceiling caused increased borrowing costs in 2011. Other factors were involved. Well not perfect alternative mechanisms are even less effective. Furthermore the debt ceiling signals fiscal discipline to investors. Removing it could a road investor confidence and potentially increase borrowing costs. Are opponents claim the debt ceiling itself causes instability. Pointing to the 2011 downgrade. However that downgrade was due to broader concerns about us debt. The world economic forum points out that only a handful of countries employ a debt ce. Because it provides a valuable signal of fiscal discipline. To lenders and investors too. The debt ceiling introduces uncertainty. That compels negotiation and compromise. Potentially leading to spending cuts or fiscal reforms. Removing it eliminates this pressure point. Our opponents imply congress will simply cut spending responsibly. Through the normal budget process. However a report titled reforming the appropriations process highlights how the appropriations process is stacked against fiscal hawks.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Reflecting on the Budget Control Act of 2011 and Its Relevance Now | Baker Institute.\n(2) US debt ceiling: Everything you need to know | World Economic Forum.\n(3) Hubbard, Glenn and Kane, Tim. *Reforming the Appropriations Process*.\n(4) *The Debt Ceiling Will Be Reinstated on January 1*."
