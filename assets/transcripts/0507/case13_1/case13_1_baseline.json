      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. We define a **four-year college degree** as the successful completion of a program of study at an accredited higher education institution, typically resulting in a Bachelor's degree. **Beneficial** is defined as producing favorable or advantageous results; contributing to improvement or well-being. And **young adults** are individuals typically between the ages of 18 and 25.\n\nOur judging criteria is **Societal Advancement**. You should prioritize the side that demonstrates the greatest contribution to the overall advancement and well-being of society. This encompasses economic, social, and personal benefits.\n\nFirst, a four-year college degree leads to **enhanced economic opportunity**. A college degree significantly increases earning potential and job security for young adults in today's competitive job market. Bachelor\u2019s degree holders earn 68% more than those with only a high school diploma [1]. The earnings gap between college graduates and those without continues to widen [1]. Median lifetime earnings are $1.2 million higher for bachelor\u2019s degree holders [2]. This isn't just about individual wealth; it strengthens the economy. Moreover, college graduates are half as likely to be unemployed as their peers whose highest degree is a high school diploma [3]. This economic stability translates to a more productive workforce and a stronger tax base, contributing to overall societal well-being. Research consistently demonstrates that a college education is a sound investment in one's future and a catalyst for economic growth. A more educated populace contributes to a stronger economy and improved societal well-being.\n\nSecond, college fosters the **development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.** College education shows potential employers you can complete a long-term project, you can think critically, solve problems, and have the capacity to learn [4]. Critical thinking encourages innovative and outside-the-box problem-solving approaches [5]. By considering multiple angles and challenging conventional ideas, critical thinkers arrive at inventive solutions to complex challenges [5]. Graduates enter the world better equipped to evaluate evidence, challenge biases, and contribute positively to society [6]. In a world grappling with complex challenges, from climate change to economic inequality, the ability to analyze information, identify problems, and develop effective solutions is paramount. A college education cultivates these essential cognitive abilities, preparing individuals to be informed and engaged citizens who can contribute meaningfully to solving the pressing issues of our time. These skills are necessary for societal advancement.\n\nThird, a college degree promotes **increased civic engagement and social mobility.** College graduates are more likely to participate in civic activities, contribute to their communities, and experience upward social mobility, strengthening the fabric of society. People with a bachelor\u2019s degree earn more money than those without \u2013 $765,000 more on average in their lifetime [7]. A study from 2022 found that young people who have social capital with people from different economic statuses are more likely to achieve increased social mobility [7]. Individuals with a college degree are more likely to vote and volunteer in their communities, have higher levels of wellbeing and better access to [8]. College graduation decreases welfare use, lowers depression, and raises self-esteem more for low-ability individuals than high-ability [9]. By providing access to knowledge, networks, and opportunities, a college education empowers individuals to climb the socioeconomic ladder,\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UMassGlobal. \"How College Impacts Salary and Future Earning Potential.\"\n(2) U.S. Department of Education. \"College Payoff.\" \n(3) Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU). \"Employment & Earnings.\"\n(4) Metropolitan State University of Denver (MSU Denver). \"15 Reasons Why College Is Important for Your Career.\"\n(5) Nichols Graduate & Professional Studies. \"Why Is Critical Thinking Important?\"\n(6) JoinKnack. \"How Higher Education Fosters Critical Thinking for a More Engaged Society.\"\n(7) Unity College. \"Education as Social Mobility.\"\n(8) Postsecondary Value Commission. \"Non-Economic Benefits Overview.\"\n(9) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). \"The effect of college education on health: A life cycle analysis.\""

      "content": "In this debate we shall argue that pursuing a 4-year college degree is no longer universally beneficial for young adults in today's society. We define beneficial as producing good results or helpful effects and being advantageous. We consider young adults to be individuals between the ages of 18 and 25. Today's society refers to the current socio-economic and technological environment. Are judging criteria is opportunity cost and return on investment. We believe the winning side will demonstrate the greatest return on investment. And minimize opportunity cost for young adults. Roi should be calculated by assessing the financial investment. Tuition fees lost wages. Versus potential earnings job security and career advancement opportunities. Opportunity cost includes alternative career paths skill development options and entrepreneurial ventures that young adults may forgo by pursuing a four-year degree. First the rising cost of education outweighs the potential earnings for many fields. The financial burden of a 4-year degree has become increasingly unsustainable. Tuition costs have sky. Leading to crippling student loan debt for many graduates the college board reports that the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2023 2024 school year. Was 11,260 at 4 year public colleges for in-state students. And 41,420 at private nonprofit colleges. Meanwhile according to a study by georgetown university center on education and the workforce. 40% of bachelor's degree holders earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. This disparity highlights a critical issue. The investment in a four-year degree does not guarantee a commensurate financial return. Especially in fields like humanities and social sciences. Leaving many graduates with a negative roi and a mountain of debt. Second skills-based training and vocational programs offer a faster and more direct route to employment in high demand industries. The modern job market increasingly values specific practical skills over broad theoretical knowledge. According to a manpower group survey 69% of employers globally are struggling to find workers with the right skills. Vocational programs in skills-based training provide targeted education and hands-on experience leading to quicker job placement and higher earning potential in fields like technology healthcare and skilled trades. For example a coding bootcamp can equip an individual with the skills to become a software developer in a matter of months allowing them to enter the workforce much faster. And with significantly less debt than a traditional computer science graduate. This direct pathway to employment addresses the skills gap. And provides a more efficient use of time and resources for young adults. 3rd degree inflation devalues the four year degree. Creating unnecessary barriers to entry level positions. Employers are increasingly requiring a 4-year degree for positions that do not inherently need one. A phenomenon known as degree inflation. A harvard business school study found that many middle skills jobs now stipulate. A college degree. As a minimum requirement. Even though only a third of the adults holding those positions possess one for. This artificial credential creates an unnecessary barrier to entry for individuals with valuable skills and experience. Acquired through alternative educational path. Or on-the-job training. It also forces young adults to incur unnecessary debt for a credential that does not guarantee better job performance or career advancement. According to test gorilla only 7% of the world's population holds a bachelor's degree 5.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) College Board.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three key flaws, which are: their narrow judging criteria, the overestimation of vocational training, and a misunderstanding of degree inflation.\n\nFirst, the opposing side has framed this debate solely on \"return on investment\" and \"opportunity cost,\" neglecting the broader benefits of a college education. We contend that this narrow economic lens fails to capture the complete picture. A college education isn't just about immediate financial gain; it's an investment in a lifetime of personal and societal enrichment. We should instead be looking at \"return on life,\" encompassing civic engagement, improved well-being, and leadership skills [6]. While they focus on initial costs, we emphasize the long-term advantages, arguing that a college degree provides a foundation for not only financial security but also a more fulfilling and impactful life.\n\nSecond, our opponents champion skills-based training as a superior alternative, but this view is short-sighted. While vocational programs may offer a quicker entry into the workforce, the jobs obtained often have lower long-term earning potential and less job security [8]. Furthermore, their claim that a ManpowerGroup survey supports their argument is misleading, as the survey addresses skill shortages across *all* industries, not just those suited to vocational training [3]. A college education provides a broader skillset applicable to a wider range of jobs, making graduates more adaptable in our rapidly changing economy. For example, someone starting a business might learn a trade through vocational training, but a college degree offers a more well-rounded approach, improving their chances of overall success.\n\nThird, the opposing side argues that degree inflation devalues a four-year degree, and they cite the statistic that only 7% of the *world's* population holds a bachelor's degree [5]. This statistic is irrelevant to the American job market. In fact, the phenomenon of degree inflation actually *strengthens* our argument. While we acknowledge that employers are increasingly requiring degrees for positions that may not have needed them in the past, this makes a college degree *more* necessary to compete. Employers still value the critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills that are cultivated through a college education [4, 7].\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Social Security Research, Statistics & Policy Analysis.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal fails to address the core issues we raised. Their arguments contain several flaws, specifically regarding their judging criteria, their unsubstantiated claims about networking, their misleading statistics on lifetime earnings, their misunderstanding of adaptability, and their inadequate response to the problem of degree inflation.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues for a vague notion of \"societal benefit\" as a primary criterion, but this is far too subjective and immeasurable. We maintain that Return on Investment and Opportunity Cost are the superior metrics because they offer a tangible and concrete way to evaluate the true value of a four-year degree for young adults. What good is a \"societal benefit\" when an individual is saddled with debt and limited career prospects? Intangible benefits, such as critical thinking and problem solving, are not exclusive to college; they can also be acquired through vocational training, entrepreneurship, and real-world experiences. While college may promote social mobility, so too do successful vocational programs and entrepreneurial ventures. The focus must remain on what provides the best individual outcome, not a nebulous societal good [1].\n\nSecond, the affirmative presents the existence of Federal TRIO programs as sufficient evidence that college provides networking opportunities and resources for disadvantaged students. However, they fail to provide any actual evidence that these programs are broadly successful. The reality is that many disadvantaged students still struggle to navigate the college system, and the reach of TRIO programs is limited. Networking opportunities are not exclusive to college campuses; they are readily available through professional organizations, online communities, and industry events, often at a fraction of the cost [2].\n\nThird, the opposition's claims about increased lifetime earnings are misleading. While some graduates may earn more over their lifetimes, this is heavily dependent on their field of study. Many college graduates, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. Furthermore, they completely ignore the opportunity cost of lost wages during the four years spent in college, as well as the burden of student loan debt, which can significantly impact long-term financial well-being [3]. The affirmative's circular reasoning claims a college degree boosts lifetime earnings, which generates wealth accumulation; however, the reference for this claim comes from the same PMC report, making the argument flawed.\n\nFourth, the affirmative equivocates on the meaning of \"adaptability.\" While a general education may provide a broad base of knowledge, vocational training offers immediately applicable skills and adaptability *within* a specific field, which is often more valuable in today's rapidly changing job market. The skills gap persists despite the increasing number of college graduates, demonstrating that a college degree does not automatically translate to job readiness. Instead of preparing graduates for specific jobs, colleges provide general skills that require additional training after graduation [4].\n\nFifth, and finally, the opposition fails to adequately address the growing problem of degree inflation. Multiple sources confirm that employers are increasingly requiring a four-year degree for positions that don't necessarily need one, creating unnecessary barriers to entry-level jobs [5]. This trend forces young adults to incur unnecessary debt for a credential that does not guarantee better job performance or career advancement, exacerbating inequality and hindering economic mobility.\n\nIn conclusion,\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Fuller, J.

We maintain that \"beneficial\" encompasses not only financial gains but also personal growth, expanded career opportunities, and social mobility. Studies show that college graduates demonstrate increased civic engagement, improved well-being, and better access to healthcare, all contributing to a more fulfilling life [6]. ROI alone cannot capture these crucial aspects.\n\nWhile our opponents highlight the potential of vocational training, we argue that a college education provides a robust foundation for long-term career success and adaptability. Graduates develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that remain valuable across industries, enabling them to navigate career transitions effectively [2, 4]. The job market is rapidly evolving. College equips individuals with a framework for continuous learning, preparing them for unforeseen changes and diverse career paths, compared to the narrower focus of vocational programs.\n\nOur opponents point to rising tuition costs and student debt as significant barriers. We acknowledge these challenges, but emphasize that, on average, college graduates still earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those with only a high school diploma [3, 8]. This increased earning potential can outweigh the initial investment, providing greater financial security and opportunities for wealth accumulation [1, 3]. We must address the student debt crisis through policy changes and increased financial aid, not by dismissing the proven benefits of higher education.\n\n**Reference**\n"
