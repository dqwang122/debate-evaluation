      "content": "In this deb. We contend that the rise of artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define creative arts as human activities involving the creation of visual auditory or performing artifact. Eg painting music literature dance that expressed the artists imaginative or technical skill. And are intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power adapted from merriam-webster dictionary. Decline. Signifies a gradual and continuous decrease in quantity quality or power. Oxford dictionary. In this context it refers to a reduction in the value opportunities and cultural significance of human created art. Finally ai artificial intelligence refers to the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages oxford dictionary. Our judging criteria is the preservation of human creativity. Beside the best demonstrates the long-term protection and promotion of human artistic endeavor should prevail. We believe that human creativity is essential for cultural richness and societal progress and any decline in human creative arts would be detrimental to society. First ai is already displacing human artists across creative industries. Forbes 2 reported confirmed predictions of massive job losses evidenced by repeated layoffs in 2023 and 2024 within the entertainment sector. Many explicitly attributed to ai integration. This displacement extends across various artistic domains from graphics design and illustrations to game design. For instance video game art assets are now automatically generated with ai directly replacing the work of human environmental artists. This shift isn't just a technological advancement. It's a systemic devaluation of human skills in labor. By automating creative tasks ai reduces opportunities for artists to develop their craft earn a living and contribute to the cultural landscape. This directly undermines the preservation of human creativity by making it harder for artists to sustain their careers. Second ai art devalues human artistic expression by flooding the market with cheap mass-produced content. While a nature study 3 notes ai art may enhance perceptions of human creativity when compared the overwhelming consensus is that ai tools negatively impact professional opportunities for artists. Ai reduces work in contracts lowers the monetary value of art. And even undermines the perceived creativity and skills required to be an artist. As vox 4 highlights the limited time people spend listening to music and the finite royalty pool. Mean that the more music is made with ai the less there is for human musicians. The result is that human artist struggle to compete. Leading to a decline in their economic viability and overall cultural influence. List devaluation actively erodes the conditions necessary for human creativity to flourish. 3rd ai raises significant ethical concerns regarding originality and copyright. Further undermining the value of human artistry. Ai models are often trained on existing artwork without proper consent or compensation leading to copyright infringement and intellectual property. Seven. As highlighted by the art newspaper 6. A us district judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey were violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Illustrators such as carla ortiz have criticized ai generated art as intellectual the. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training 6. Moreover many jurisdictions including the us do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by ai 6.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UNCTAD.

      "content": "In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Oxford Dictionary. Definition of Artificial Intelligence.\n(2) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, which are their definitions of \"decline,\" their judging criterion, and their overestimation of the positive impact of AI tools on creativity.\n\nFirst, the opposition defines \"decline\" as \"gradual and irreversible,\" setting an unreasonably high bar. Even a *temporary* or *reversible* decline in the value, originality, and economic viability of human art is a significant problem, especially if it disproportionately affects human artists. It\u2019s like saying a patient isn\u2019t sick unless the illness is guaranteed to be fatal \u2013 we should treat ailments before they become irreversible. The core of our argument is the here and now. We are already seeing the initial phases of a decline in demand for human generated art as AI proliferation continues to expand across industries [1].\n\nSecond, the opposition's judging criterion\u2014the preservation of human agency and innovation\u2014misses the point. We contend that even if human artists retain agency and continue to innovate, the *value* and *economic opportunities* for those artists can still decline due to AI. The mere existence of human agency doesn\u2019t inherently guarantee a thriving art scene. Imagine a world where humans are free to create, but nobody values or buys their art because AI-generated alternatives flood the market. We should not focus on the bare minimum.\n\nThird, while the opposition argues that AI is a tool to augment human creativity, this argument overlooks the very real dangers of devaluation and homogenization. While AI *can* be a tool, its accessibility and ease of use are leading to a flood of AI-generated content that undermines the value of human skill and dedication. They claim that 20% of people view AI as a tool for human artists [7]. But that means 80% do not! And is that 20% figure from artists or just people? Furthermore, numerous reports detail how AI is already displacing human artists across various industries, from graphic design to game development [1]. Moreover, the ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding AI art are not necessarily incentivizing human artists. In fact, the lack of clear legal frameworks and the fear of having their work copied and devalued may actually *discourage* artists from pursuing their craft. Illustrators have had their art illegally used to train AI systems [6]. Why would they continue to make art if there is a high probability that it will be stolen?\n\n**Reference**\n(1) E. Clark.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.\n\nFirst, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods [6, 7].\nThus, AI expands creative horizons.\n\nSecond, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear [2].\nConsequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.\n\nThird, the opposition challenges our definition of \"decline,\" arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands \u2013 a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.\n\nFourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Amanda Weston AMME Facebook Post.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the core issues of artistic originality and the economic opportunities for human artists in the age of AI.\n\nThe opposition claims AI expands creative horizons, yet it merely remixes existing data, lacking genuine originality. AI is trained on existing data, so it can only remix and recombine existing styles. It's a sophisticated form of plagiarism, not true originality. As we said before, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition [1]. People still value quality and skill, but the *perception* that art is easily created *is* devaluing the work of human artists.\n\nThis leads to our second key point: the economic realities facing human artists. We are already seeing AI displace human artists in industries ranging from graphic design to game development [2]. How can human artists compete with AI that generates art in seconds at virtually no cost? The photography analogy falls flat; it created a new medium, but AI attempts to replace an existing one. This decline warrants immediate concern, rejecting the opposition's call for us to wait until the point of no return.\n\nWe acknowledge the importance of human agency and innovation, but they are not enough to guarantee economic opportunity. Even with agency, AI could still flood the market with cheap art, hurting human artists.\n\nOur values center on preserving human artistry, not merely for artists' sake, but for our society's cultural richness. The arts shape our understanding of the world, express our emotions, and foster connections.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD).

      "content": "Thank you chair person and a steam judges. Today we've heard a debate framed by fear. The fear that ai will spell the decline of human creative arts. We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Digital Brew.
