      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling, which we define as the total amount of money that the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations. Abolishing it means removing this limit entirely.\n\nOur judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and minimizing unnecessary political risk. We believe the most desirable outcome is one that promotes long-term economic stability for the United States and avoids manufactured crises stemming from political brinkmanship related to the debt ceiling.\n\nFirst, the debt ceiling creates artificial economic instability and uncertainty. The recurring threat of breaching the debt ceiling injects unnecessary volatility into financial markets. According to a Brookings Institution article, the impacts of a default, even if ultimately averted, are undoubtedly negative [1]. This constant brinkmanship undermines investor confidence and raises borrowing costs for the U.S. government. For instance, during the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, Standard & Poor's downgraded the U.S. credit rating, leading to increased borrowing costs [2]. Abolishing the debt ceiling would eliminate this manufactured crisis point and foster a more stable economic environment.\n\nSecond, the debt ceiling fails to achieve fiscal discipline. Former Federal Reserve economist Dr. Louise Sheiner argues that the debt ceiling has not achieved the stated goal of its proponents: imposing fiscal discipline on Congress [3]. The debt ceiling is a completely arbitrary value with no economic justification [4]. Spending decisions are made through the budget process. The debt ceiling merely authorizes the borrowing necessary to pay for already-approved expenditures. The House Budget Committee Democratic Caucus supports complete removal of the debt ceiling, arguing that the debt limit only serves to add unnecessary risk as spending decisions have already been made by other legislation [5].\n\nThird, abolishing the debt ceiling reduces political gridlock and improves government efficiency. The debt ceiling has become a political weapon, leading to unnecessary gridlock and hindering the government's ability to function effectively. As stated by NPR, abolishing the debt ceiling could prevent economic instability and ensure the government meets its financial obligations without risking default [6]. Eliminating the debt ceiling removes the need for periodic political negotiations over raising the ceiling [7]. This streamlines the process of paying the nation's bills and allows Congress to focus on more pressing issues.\n\nIn conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling is vital for fostering economic stability, preventing unnecessary political crises, and improving government efficiency. For these reasons, we strongly affirm the resolution.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Sheiner, L. (2023). The economics of the debt ceiling debate. Brookings Institution.\n(2) CNN. (2023).

      "content": "In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should not abolish the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is a legislative limit on the amount of national debt that the U.S. Treasury can incur, limiting the amount of money the federal government can borrow to pay its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, national debt interest, tax refunds, and other payments. This definition is important because it clarifies that the debt ceiling doesn't authorize new spending, but rather allows the government to pay for existing obligations already approved by Congress.\n\nOur judging criteria is fiscal stability and responsible governance. The most desirable outcome is one that promotes long-term fiscal stability and responsible governance, ensuring the U.S. government meets its obligations without jeopardizing the economic well-being of its citizens or the global economy. We should evaluate whether abolishing the debt ceiling contributes to or detracts from this stability and responsibility.\n\nFirst, the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility by requiring legislative consent, giving Congress oversight authority [1]. The Council on Foreign Relations notes that the debt limit requires legislative consent, providing Congress some oversight authority and engendering fiscal accountability [1]. Without the debt ceiling, there would be less incentive for Congress to control spending, potentially leading to a rapid accumulation of debt. Economist De Rugy argues that the debt ceiling helps keep the budget normalized, stating that \"Congress has behaved irresponsibly for years\" [2]. Abolishing the debt ceiling would remove a critical check on government spending, fostering an environment of fiscal irresponsibility and potentially increasing the national debt.\n\nSecond, the debt ceiling encourages negotiation and compromise on fiscal policy, leading to more considered decisions. While often contentious, the debt ceiling forces dialogue and potential agreements on spending and revenue. Removing this pressure could result in unilateral actions and less fiscal restraint. Scott Peters (D-CA) and Bill Huizenga (R-MI) reintroduced the Responsible Budgeting Act (RBA), which would create new mechanisms to raise the debt ceiling while promoting fiscally responsible solutions [3]. This act demonstrates that the debt ceiling can be a catalyst for bipartisan efforts to address fiscal challenges. Thus, maintaining the debt ceiling is crucial for fostering a balanced and responsible approach to fiscal policy.\n\nThird, abolishing the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. debt and trigger economic instability. Removing this fiscal restraint could signal to investors that the U.S. is not committed to fiscal discipline, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs and a financial crisis. As the Brookings Institution points out, eliminating the debt ceiling could lead to higher borrowing costs and an increased risk of economic recession [4]. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warns that removing the debt ceiling could lead to default, higher interest rates, and a severe economic downturn, risking global financial instability and significant job losses [5]. Thus, the debt ceiling provides a necessary safeguard against economic instability and maintains investor confidence.\n\nIn conclusion, maintaining the debt ceiling is essential for fiscal responsibility, encouraging negotiation, and preserving economic stability. Abolishing it would remove a crucial check on government spending, undermine investor confidence, and potentially trigger a financial crisis. For these reasons, we stand firmly against abolishing the debt ceiling.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Council on Foreign Relations. (n.d.). What Happens When the U.S. Hits Its Debt Ceiling?.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, which are their misunderstanding of the judging criterion, their assertion that the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility, and their claim that abolishing the debt ceiling would undermine confidence in U.S. debt.\n\nFirst, concerning the judging criterion, while the opposition claims to value \"fiscal stability and responsible governance,\" we contend that this is inherently dependent on a strong U.S. economy. Our focus on achieving the most beneficial outcome for the U.S. economy is not separate from fiscal stability, but rather the *foundation* upon which it rests. Abolishing the debt ceiling directly contributes to fiscal stability by preventing the manufactured crises and potential defaults that arise from political brinkmanship [1]. As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned, a default could cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy [2]. Therefore, our criterion of the most beneficial economic outcome is, in fact, the most direct path to achieving their stated goal of fiscal stability and responsible governance.\n\nSecond, the opposition argues that the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility by requiring legislative consent. However, this is demonstrably false. The debt ceiling has historically been a catalyst for political standoffs and near-defaults, undermining fiscal responsibility rather than promoting it [3]. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis, for example, led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and increased borrowing costs for the government [4]. The debt ceiling does not effectively control spending; it merely provides an opportunity for political hostage-taking. The fact that both sides benefit when agreements are reached shows that the debt ceiling does nothing to push either side to agree, as any agreement would be better than a default.\n\nThird, the opposition claims that abolishing the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. debt. We argue the opposite is true. The very *existence* of the debt ceiling introduces uncertainty and the risk of default, which inherently *harms* investor confidence. Brookings Institution notes that \"bickering over the debt ceiling...creates unnecessary uncertainty, threatens the benefits of issuing the world's safest asset\" [5]. Removing this artificial constraint would reassure investors that the U.S. is committed to meeting its obligations, thereby *strengthening* our financial standing. Furthermore, if the U.S. fails to raise the debt ceiling, confidence plummets, causing financial crises.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) U.S. Debt Ceiling Default Threatens the Global Economy. *Foreign Policy*, 2023.\n(2) Yellen, Janet.

      "content": "Thank you chair person. Steam judges ladies and gentlemen. The opponent's arguments contain five critical flaws. Which are their claims that the debt ceiling one doesn't promote fiscal responsibility to doesn't encourage negotiation constructively? 3 undermines confidence in us deb. 4 is economically devastating to breach and 5 is merely a limit on paying for already approved spending. First the opposition argues that the debt ceiling is merely a political tool. Failing to promote fiscal responsibility. However the potential for political maneuvering exists in any system. Including the budgeting process they advocate. Claiming the debt ceiling never promotes fiscal responsibility. Is a straw man. The council on foreign relations notes that the debt limit requires legislative consent thereby providing congress some oversight authority. An engendering fiscal accountability one. This oversight while sometimes contentious provides a crucial layer of scrutiny often absent in routine budget approvals. Therefore discarding the debt ceiling entirely. Is an overreaction to potential political abuse. Second the opposition claims that the debt ceiling creates artificial crises. And hinders constructive negotiation. This argument shifts the focus from the fundamental purpose of the debt. To encourage fiscal negotiation. To the manner in which those negotiations occur. We agree the process can be improved. As demonstrated by the bipartisan responsible budgeting act. Aimed at fostering more responsible solutions. However eliminating the debt ceiling entirely. Would remove a critical forcing function that compels dialogue on spending and revenue. Ultimately harming fiscal discipline. As economists darucci notes the debt ceiling is necessary. To keep the budget normal. And those criticizing it are upset about the symptom not the disease itself. Thus while the process isn't perfect. The debt ceilings core function remains vital. Third our opponents suggest that abolishing the debt ceiling strengthens investor confidence and prevents default. On the contrary removing this fiscal restraint could weaken investor confidence by signaling a lack of commitment to fiscal discipline. While they argue the risk of default undermines confidence. Abolishing the ceiling entirely could increase the likelihood of unsustainable debt accumulation. Ironically. Increase the long-term risk of default. Abolishing the debt ceiling could lead to economic recession. Financial market disruptions and higher borrowing costs potentially undermining us financial stability 5. Maintaining the debt ceiling therefore provides a necessary signal of fiscal prudence to international investors. Fourth the opposition claims that breaching the debt ceiling would be economically devastating. While we acknowledge the potential for short-term economic disruption during a debt ceiling impasse. We maintained that the long-term consequences of unchecked spending and rising national debt are far more devastating. The debt ceiling acts as a financial safety. Helping to keep the economy running 6. A brief period of uncertainty is preferable to the certainty of fiscal collapse caused by unrestrained spending. Fifth the opposition argues that the debt ceiling merely limits paying for already approved spending. This argument ignores the critical point that spending decisions are not immutable. Just because spending was approved. Doesn't mean it should continue without re-evaluation. The debt ceiling forces congress to periodically reevaluate the nation's fiscal trajectory. Providing an opportunity to adjust spending in light of evolving economic conditions. Eliminating this check removes a valuable mechanism for raining in excessive spending.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Council on Foreign Relations. (n.d.). What Happens When the U.S. Hits Its Debt Ceiling?.

      "content": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around whether abolishing the debt ceiling is the most responsible path to economic stability for the United States.\n\nThe core clash centers on fiscal responsibility and economic stability. Our opponents argue that the debt ceiling promotes fiscal discipline, but the evidence shows it's primarily a political tool that creates economic instability [1]. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis, for example, led to a U.S. credit rating downgrade and raised borrowing costs [2]. Congress already possesses the tools for fiscal control through the budget process. The debt ceiling simply adds unnecessary risk, holding the economy hostage. We are not claiming the budget process is perfect, but to suggest the alternative to the debt ceiling is unrestrained spending is a false dilemma.\n\nThis directly impacts investor confidence and U.S. creditworthiness. Rating agencies like Standard and Poor\u2019s and Fitch have already cited political gridlock surrounding the debt ceiling as a reason for downgrading the U.S.'s credit rating [3]. Abolishing the debt ceiling signals a commitment to meeting our obligations, thereby strengthening investor confidence. This isn't about giving Congress a blank check; it's about ensuring they pay the bills they've already approved.\n\nFinally, let's address negotiation. The debt ceiling doesn't foster constructive compromise; it creates artificial crises [4]. Genuine negotiation should occur during the budget process, not under the threat of economic collapse. Is creating a crisis really the best way to encourage negotiation?\n\nUltimately, this debate is about economic stability and prosperity for all Americans. By removing the manufactured threat of default, we ensure the government can meet its obligations, bolstering our economy and securing our financial future.\n\n**Reference**\n(1) Yellen, Janet.
