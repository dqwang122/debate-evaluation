                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Future Use of Information</h6>
                    <p>In the future, once we have removed all identifiable information from your data, we may use the data for our future research studies, or we may distribute the data to other investigators for their research studies. We would do this without getting additional informed consent from you (or your legally authorized representative). Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified.</p>
                </div>

As with any payment transaction, there is the risk of a breach of confidentiality from the third-party vendor. All personal information collected by the researcher will be held as strictly confidential and stored in a password-protected digital file, or in a locked file cabinet, until payments are processed and reconciled. This information will be destroyed at the earliest acceptable time. Personal information held by the third-party vendor will be held according to their terms of use policy.</p>
