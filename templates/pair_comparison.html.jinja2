    <p>
        You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. 
        You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. 
        There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. 
        The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.
