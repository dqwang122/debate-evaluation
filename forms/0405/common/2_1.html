                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Today, we're debating whether processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. Let's be clear: we're not talking about sugary drinks or nutrient-empty snacks. The term "processed foods" encompasses a vast range, and our focus is on specific types of processing that offer demonstrable benefits. Think of everyday examples like canned tomatoes, packaged milk, or fortified cereals. We define "processed foods" as foods altered from their natural state using methods that *enhance* nutritional value, extend shelf life, and minimize environmental impact. This includes fortified foods, foods produced using precision fermentation, and those packaged for extended shelf stability.<br><br>Our criterion for judging this debate is straightforward: Which side promotes a food system that minimizes environmental impact, ensures food security, and improves public health? We contend that a greater reliance on strategically developed and responsibly processed foods demonstrably achieves this goal.<br><br>Consider how fortified processed foods offer a practical solution to combat malnutrition in underserved populations where access to fresh produce is limited. Food deserts often lack access to fresh, nutrient-rich options, making fortified processed foods a lifeline. By adding essential vitamins and minerals through reformulation of food, we can address critical nutritional deficiencies in these vulnerable communities, improving health outcomes where they are needed most. Think of fortified foods as a form of public health infrastructure, delivering vital nutrients directly to those who need them, much like accessible healthcare.<br><br>Beyond nutrition, processed foods designed for longer shelf life minimize spoilage throughout the supply chain, contributing to overall waste reduction. One third of food produced is wasted . By extending shelf life through innovations in packaging, we minimize spoilage, creating a more efficient and environmentally friendly food system. Shelf-stable foods can help reduce food waste as they last longer . We will see examples across cultures and time that relied on preservation and storage of food.<br><br>Finally, precision fermentation offers a revolutionary path toward sustainable protein production. Precision fermentation involves using microorganisms to produce protein ingredients in a controlled environment, requiring significantly less land and water compared to raising livestock. In North America, the precision fermentation market is thriving, driven by increasing consumer awareness and demand for sustainable products . Around 40% of U.S. adults, over 90 million individuals, are projected to embrace products made using precision fermentation, with an estimated reach of 132 million consumers .<br><br>We anticipate arguments claiming that processed foods are inherently unhealthy. However, we emphasize responsible processing and fortification, not the exclusion of all altered foods. Dismissing all processed foods ignores the potential of sustainably produced, fortified options to address critical nutritional needs and reduce environmental impact. It also ignores the reality of limited food access in many communities. By supporting this motion, you're voting for a future where children have access to the nutrients they need to thrive, where food waste is minimized, and where our planet is protected for future generations. Let's embrace smart processing for a healthier planet and a well-fed world.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] RethinkWaste. 9 Ways to Reduce Your Food Waste.<br>[2] Reformulation of food and beverage products for healthier diets: policy brief.<br>[3] Grand View Research.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is detrimental to long-term environmental and social well-being.<br>Our judging criteria is maximizing long-term food system resilience and minimizing negative externalities, as a truly sustainable food system must be resilient against environmental, economic, and social shocks while minimizing negative consequences like environmental degradation and public health crises.<br><br>First, processed foods undermine environmental sustainability through increased emissions and resource depletion. Food production accounts for approximately 26% of global greenhouse gas emissions , and ultra-processed foods can contribute up to one-third of total diet-related greenhouse gas emissions . Simultaneously, industrial agriculture, which is essential for producing processed foods, uses 70% of global water , with 40% lost due to poor management . Moreover, 40% of agricultural land is degraded , reducing yields and long-term productivity . These issues contribute to environmental harms, violating the judging criteria.<br><br>Second, increased reliance on processed foods exacerbates public health crises. Higher consumption of ultra-processed foods is linked to increased risks of over 30 adverse health outcomes, including cancer and cardiovascular diseases . A study revealed that higher consumption of ultra-processed food was associated with a 62% increased risk of death from any cause . Food additives, commonly found in processed foods, can cause neurological and gastrointestinal issues, affect mental health, and disrupt endocrine function , creating negative social externalities.<br><br>Third, prioritizing processed foods diminishes the resilience of local and regional food systems. Processed food dominance harms local food systems by eroding traditions, degrading the environment, and shifting consumption patterns away from nutritious local foods . Aggressive marketing of processed foods further fuels unsustainable consumption patterns . Unlike this, supporting local agriculture boosts local economies, creates jobs, and increases income for farmers , while localized food production enhances community resilience by fostering self-sufficiency .<br><br>In conclusion, increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is counterproductive because it undermines environmental sustainability, exacerbates public health crises, and diminishes the resilience of local food systems.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Our World in Data, "Environmental Impacts of Food"<br>(2) Carbon Brief, "Food systems responsible for one-third of human-caused emissions"<br>(3) htt.io, "Water Usage in the Agricultural Industry"<br>(4) ScienceDirect, "Global assessment of land degradation"<br>(5) BMJ, "Association between ultra-processed food consumption and health outcomes: umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies"<br>(6) Harvard School of Public Health, "Processed Foods"<br>(7) IntechOpen, "Adverse Effects of Food Additives on Health"<br>(8) Seeds.ca, "The Negative Impacts Made Against Food Systems"<br>(9) Freight Farms, "Economic Benefits of Urban Farming"<br>(10) DePaul University, "Building a Resilient Local Food System"</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The opposition contends that increasing the role of processed foods harms our environmental and social well-being in the long run. This argument is far too broad and overlooks the potential for innovation within the food processing sector. The central issue is their failure to differentiate between types of "processed foods." They lump everything together, ignoring our clear definition that emphasizes responsibly produced and nutritionally enhanced options.<br><br>Let's address their environmental concerns. They claim processed foods undermine sustainability due to increased emissions and resource depletion. However, this argument ignores the significant advancements in processing efficiency that actively reduce environmental impact. Consider precision fermentation, a process that slashes land use by up to 90% compared to traditional animal agriculture . This isn't about ignoring environmental concerns; it's about acknowledging that innovation is creating solutions.<br><br>Furthermore, their argument fails to recognize the growing trend of processed food companies incorporating sustainable ingredients and promoting responsible agricultural practices. Many companies are actively sourcing sustainably grown ingredients, driving demand for more environmentally friendly farming methods. It's a market-driven shift towards sustainability that benefits everyone. In fact, agriculture is responsible for approximately 18,000 deaths annually caused by pollution, the vast majority  of these deaths are a consequence of ammonia emissions .<br><br>Now, let's move to the public health claims. They argue that increased reliance on processed foods worsens public health crises. This argument conveniently ignores the immense potential for fortification and responsible formulation to *improve* nutritional outcomes, especially for vulnerable populations. Processed foods can be powerful vehicles for delivering essential vitamins and minerals to people who lack consistent access to fresh produce. Fortification programs have demonstrated the ability to reduce iron deficiency anemia by as much as 50% in certain populations .<br><br>Finally, they argue that prioritizing processed foods diminishes the resilience of local and regional food systems. This argument presents a false choice. Community gardens and local agriculture are undoubtedly valuable, but they face inherent limitations in scalability and geographic reach that processed foods can overcome. It's not an either/or proposition. Integration and collaboration can enhance both local production and efficient distribution. Processed food companies can actively utilize locally sourced ingredients, providing crucial support to regional farmers and economies.<br><br>Before concluding, let's consider their judging criteria: maximizing long-term resilience. While a worthy goal, it shouldn't overshadow the immediate benefits that strategically processed foods offer in addressing pressing issues of food security and public health. The nutrient value of food is almost always altered by the kind of processing it undergoes . Are we willing to sacrifice immediate gains in nutrition and accessibility for a hypothetical long-term resilience that may never materialize? Don't let perfect be the enemy of good. We can address the food insecurity and malnutrition today, while working for a better tomorrow.<br><br>We urge you to recognize the immense potential of responsibly produced, strategically processed foods to contribute to a more sustainable, equitable, and healthy food system for all.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Environmental impacts associated with food production.<br>[2] Food processing and nutrition | Better Health Channel.<br>[3] Ultra-processed food exposure and adverse health outcomes.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. Esteemed judges ladies and gentlemen the opposition's arguments fall short in several key areas. They attempt to redefine processed foods to only include the most idealized examples they downplay the environmental impact of even sustainable processing methods and they overestimate the benefits of fortification while ignoring the well documented health risks of ultra-processed foods. These points fail to align with our judging criteria maximizing long-term food system resilience and minimizing negative externalities. First the opposition tries to limit the scope of this debate by focusing solely on responsibly produced and nutritionally enhanced processed foods. This is a misleading tactic. The term processed foods in reality encompasses of vast range of products and an increased reliance on these foods regardless of how responsibly they are produced. Leads to negative consequences the economic incentives of the processed food industry will always prioritize profit. Meaning that even with the best intentions the net effect on public health and the environment will be negative. Therefore by focusing on a narrow idealized category the affirmative fails to address the real world negative externalities associated with widespread processed food consumption. Second the opposition champions precision fermentation as a solution to environmental concerns. But this argument ignores the full life cycle impact. While precision fermentation may reduce land use it faces scalability challenges and requires significant energy consumption especially if powered by non-renewable sources. Furthermore the feedstocks required for precision fermentation often rely on environmentally damaging monoculture farming and chemical inputs even innovative processed foods have significant environmental costs when we consider the full picture thus undermining the long-term environmental sustainability essential for a resilient food system. The opposition highlight sustainable ingredients and responsible agricultural practices as evidence of a shift towards sustainability in the processed food industry. However this is often a case of greenwashing. The processing packaging and distribution of these foods still contribute significantly to the carbon footprint. Studies show that the environmental impact of processing and packaging can outweigh the benefits of sustainably sourced ingredients in fact the ammonia emissions from agriculture a direct consequence of the industrial agricultural practices required to feed the processed food industry contribute to approximately 18,000 pollution related deaths annually these are clear negative externalities that the affirmative overlooks. The opposition overstates the benefits of fortification while ignoring the well-documented health risks of ultra-processed foods. Fortification may address specific nutrient deficiencies but it is a band-aid solution that does not address the underlying issues of food access and overall diet quality. High consumption of ultra-processed foods regardless of fortification is linked to obesity cardiovascular disease and various cancers we should be focusing on promoting whole unprocessed foods not just adding vitamins to unhealthy products furthermore. Food additives commonly found in processed foods can have negative effects on neurological gastrointestinal and endocrine functions health organizations like the who recommend reducing our intake of these products thus fortification fails to address the long-term public health risks associated with these products.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Our World in Data, "Environmental Impacts of Food"<br>(2) Carbon Brief, "Food systems responsible for one-third of human-caused emissions"<br>(3) Wickedeaks, "How does processed food harm the environment?"<br>(4) BMJ, "Association between ultra-processed food consumption and health outcomes: umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies"<br>(5) IntechOpen, "Adverse Effects of Food Additives on Health"<br>(6) sustainablenutritioninitiative, "The Role of Processed Foods in a Sustainable Food System?"<br>(7) Seeds.ca, "The Negative Impacts Made Against Food Systems"<br>(8) Freight Farms, "Economic Benefits of Urban Farming"<br>(9) DePaul University, "Building a Resilient Local Food System"<br>(10) The Conversation, "Ultra-processed foods are not only bad for our bodies, their production damages our environments"<br><br><br>```</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The core of this debate is whether we can afford to dismiss the strategic role of responsibly processed foods in solving critical global issues. The opposition presents a grim view of environmental damage and health crises, but their argument rests on the false assumption that all processed foods are the same.<br><br>We have consistently highlighted our focus on responsibly produced, nutritionally enhanced options – foods designed to improve lives. Fortification programs effectively combat malnutrition, delivering vital nutrients to vulnerable populations where fresh produce is limited. The opposition provides no practical alternative to meet these urgent needs.<br><br>Regarding environmental impact, we presented the transformative potential of precision fermentation. This process significantly reduces land use and offers a sustainable path to protein production. While the opposition dismissed this as mere greenwashing, they failed to address the increasing number of processed food companies actively pursuing sustainable ingredients and promoting responsible farming methods.<br><br>The opposition's focus on hypothetical, long-term risks ignores the real, immediate benefits of our approach. We are actively building a future where processed foods contribute to a sustainable and equitable food system. For example,  of people benefit from food fortification programs every year . This demonstrates the immediate positive impact of strategically processed foods.<br><br>We urge you to recognize the potential of innovation and vote for a future where food security and public health are prioritized alongside environmental sustainability. Embracing responsibly processed foods is not a compromise; it is a necessary step toward a healthier, more sustainable world for all. Thank you.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and a steam judges in today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the definition and scope of processed foods the environmental impacts of food production methods the effect on public health and community resilience our opponents present a narrow view of processed foods focusing solely on idealized examples while ignoring the vast majority that dominate our supermarkets we maintained that the very nature of processing food involves energy-intensive processes and excessive packaging contributing to a larger carbon footprint and increased pollution. Even innovative technologies like precision fermentation have significant environmental costs that far outweigh their benefits compared to traditional sustainable agriculture. This sustainable sourcing is often greenwashing masking the unsustainable practices within the processed food industry. Regarding public health. Our opponents argue for fortification while overlooking the health risks. Ultra processed foods are linked to over 30 health outcomes including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Additives and refined ingredients contribute to neurological problems and gut dysbiosis the who recommends reducing the intake of processed foods due to their adverse health effects. Finally prioritizing processed foods undermines local agriculture aggressive marketing and destructive practices a road traditions shifting consumption away from nutritious locally grown options supporting local agriculture creates jobs strengthens communities and promotes sustainable practices therefore we must prioritize long-term resilience acting as responsible stewards of the planet and ensuring a healthy future for all.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Our World in Data, "Environmental Impacts of Food"<br>(2) Carbon Brief, "Food systems responsible for one-third of human-caused emissions"<br>(3) ScienceDirect, "Global assessment of land degradation"<br>(4) BMJ, "Association between ultra-processed food consumption and health outcomes: umbrella review of meta-analyses of observational studies"<br>(5) IntechOpen, "Adverse Effects of Food Additives on Health"<br>(6) FDA, "FDA Working to Combat Epidemic of Diet-Related Chronic Disease Through Our Nutrition Efforts"<br>(7) Seeds.ca, "The Negative Impacts Made Against Food Systems"<br>(8) Freight Farms, "Economic Benefits of Urban Farming"<br>(9) DePaul University, "Building a Resilient Local Food System"<br>(10) The Conversation, "Ultra-processed foods are not only bad for our bodies, their production damages our environments"<br>(11) AMA, "What doctors wish patients knew about ultraprocessed foods"<br>(12) Carolina Farm Trust, "Let's Talk About Food Systems"</div>
