                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that processed foods, through strategic integration and technological advancement, should play a larger role in sustainable food systems to enhance resource efficiency, ensure food security, and minimize environmental impact.<br><br>Our judging criteria is utilitarianism: Maximizing overall well-being for current and future generations by optimizing resource use, minimizing environmental impact, and ensuring equitable access to nutritious food. We believe the team that best demonstrates how increasing the role of processed foods leads to a net positive outcome in terms of resource efficiency, environmental protection, and food security should win this debate.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly reduce food waste, a major contributor to environmental damage. Food waste accounts for approximately 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions . Processing extends shelf life through methods like canning and freezing, preventing spoilage and reducing waste at the consumer level. For example, preserving foods through processing ensures food safety and prolongs their shelf life – so we throw away less food because it has . Furthermore, processing allows for the utilization of byproducts, such as turning fruit peels into pectin or whey into protein concentrate, maximizing resource use . By minimizing waste throughout the supply chain, processed foods directly address resource inefficiency and reduce the environmental burden associated with food production, thus contributing to a more sustainable food system.<br><br>Second, processed foods enhance food security by improving the affordability and accessibility of nutritious food, particularly in food-insecure regions. Food processing increases the convenience and variety of the foods available . Processing can lower costs through economies of scale and extend shelf life for distribution to remote areas, making essential nutrients accessible to vulnerable populations. For example, fortified processed foods like iodized salt and vitamin A-enriched oil have proven effective in combating micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries . Moreover, processed foods can be reformulated to be healthier and more sustainable . By ensuring consistent quality and availability, processed foods play a critical role in addressing malnutrition and supporting global food security, particularly in regions where fresh produce is scarce or unaffordable, thereby maximizing overall well-being.<br><br>Third, innovations in food processing are creating more environmentally friendly and resource-efficient methods. Advances in technologies like AI, IoT, and non-thermal processing are reducing energy consumption, water usage, and greenhouse gas emissions in food processing plants . These innovations include mild heat processing, microwave, extrusion porosification technology, high pressure thermal processing, Infra Red, and Pulsed Electric Field . Key methods involve mild heat, microwaves, and pulsed electric fields . By implementing sustainable processing practices, the food industry can minimize its environmental footprint and align with long-term sustainability goals. This shift towards greener technologies not only enhances resource efficiency but also ensures the long-term viability of food production, contributing to a more sustainable and resilient food system for future generations.<br><br>In conclusion, processed foods, when strategically integrated and technologically advanced, are essential for achieving a sustainable food system. By reducing food waste, enhancing food security, and embracing innovative processing methods, we can optimize resource use, minimize environmental impact, and ensure equitable access to nutritious food for all. We urge you to recognize the critical role of processed foods in building a more sustainable and resilient future.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Nature. 2024.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the proposition that processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. The idea that prioritizing processed foods aligns with sustainability is a dangerous misdirection.<br><br>Let's address the utilitarian framework that my opponents will likely propose – maximizing overall well-being through resource optimization, environmental protection, and equitable access to nutritious food. While seemingly logical, this framework overlooks the inherent ethical problems. It risks sacrificing long-term well-being for short-term gains, a dangerous trade-off when considering the consequences of increased processed food consumption. We must consider the true cost, not just the immediate convenience.<br><br>Now, let’s dismantle their core arguments. They will likely claim processed foods reduce waste. However, consider the sheer volume of packaging involved. The journey of a single processed item, from factory to shelf to home, is paved with wrappers, plastics, and cardboard. Food processing, transport, packaging and retail all require energy and resource inputs. They will also claim that processed foods enhance food security. However, these foods are often calorie-dense but nutrient-poor, contributing to obesity and related health problems. According to a review in the January 2024 issue of Advances in Nutrition, ultra-processed foods are linked to a higher risk of diabetes, high blood pressure, unfavorable blood lipids, and obesity .<br><br>They might argue that innovations are making processing more environmentally friendly. While advancements are commendable, they barely address the fundamental problem: the resource intensity of processed food production. Agriculture has a significant environmental impact in three key ways. First, it requires large amounts of fresh water, which can cause significant environmental pressures in regions with water stress. It needs water as input and pollutes rivers, lakes, and oceans by releasing nutrients. It is a crucial driver of climate change, responsible for around one-quarter of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions .<br><br>The increasing consolidation within the processed food industry limits opportunities for small-scale farmers, harming rural economies. The dominance of large corporations in the processed food sector makes it difficult for smaller, local farms to compete and access markets, thereby diminishing agricultural diversity. We are losing the foundation of a resilient and diverse agricultural landscape.<br><br>Finally, let's not forget the additives. Many processed foods contain artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives that have been linked to potential health problems with long-term consumption. Furthermore, many processed food companies are participating in "greenwashing". If your food packaging promises big things when it comes to their natural content but supplies no official certifications, it’s probably a prime example of greenwashing .<br><br>Therefore, we firmly believe that processed foods have no place in a truly sustainable food system. We must prioritize food systems that nourish both people and the planet, not just corporate bottom lines. I urge you to consider the long-term consequences of prioritizing convenience over health, environmental responsibility, and economic equity. Make informed choices about the food you consume and support local farmers markets and businesses.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Corliss, Julie. “Putting Processed Foods into Perspective - Harvard Health.” *Harvard Health*, April 1, 2024.<br>[2] Ritchie, Hannah.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent’s opening statement contains five key flaws, which are their overemphasis on packaging waste, their misrepresentation of the nutritional value of processed foods, their failure to recognize the environmental advantages of processing, their misunderstanding of the relationship between corporate dominance and processed foods, and their exaggeration of the issues related to additives and greenwashing.<br><br>First, the opponent claims that processed foods contribute significantly to packaging waste; however, they fail to acknowledge that fresh produce also requires substantial packaging and transportation, leading to waste . Many processed foods are available in bulk or utilize innovative, sustainable packaging solutions. For example, several companies are now using biodegradable or compostable packaging materials . The benefits of reduced food waste from processed foods outweigh the environmental impact of packaging, especially when coupled with effective recycling programs.<br><br>Second, the opponent argues that processed foods are inherently “calorie-dense but nutrient-poor,” but this is a sweeping generalization. Many fortified processed foods, such as cereals with added vitamins and minerals, contribute significantly to public health . Minimally processed options like canned tomatoes and frozen vegetables retain much of their nutritional value . Moreover, unhealthy eating habits are not exclusive to processed foods; they are a broader issue of dietary choices. Therefore, we must focus on the overall sustainability of the food system rather than fixating on individual health problems.<br><br>Third, the opponent points to the environmental impact of agriculture; however, agriculture impacts all food supplies, whether fresh or processed. Processed foods can mitigate these impacts by reducing waste and improving resource efficiency . Sustainable farming practices are increasingly being adopted, reducing water use, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions . Innovations in processed food production further enhance water and energy efficiency, contributing to a smaller overall environmental footprint.<br><br>Fourth, the opponent suggests that the processed food industry's corporate dominance harms small-scale farmers; however, many smaller businesses use food processing to sell and distribute their products, creating opportunities for local agriculture . A diverse range of processed foods relies on various agricultural sources, supporting agricultural diversity. Therefore, processed foods do not inherently lead to the demise of small farms or a lack of agricultural diversity.<br><br>Fifth, the opponent mentions artificial additives and "greenwashing" as inherent problems with processed foods; however, not all processed foods contain harmful additives, and many adhere to strict regulations and labeling requirements . The presence of greenwashing does not negate the potential for true sustainability . It simply highlights the need for greater transparency and accountability in the food industry.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) United Nations Environment Programme.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">My opposition's argument crumbles under scrutiny. They present a utilitarian facade, claiming to maximize well-being, but their vision is morally bankrupt. Where is the consideration for the small farmers crushed under the weight of processed food giants? Where is the compassion for animals subjected to inhumane conditions to fuel these industries? Their "efficiency" is a smokescreen for prioritizing profit over sustainability and justice.<br><br>They tout processed foods as waste-reducing marvels. This is a blatant falsehood. Processed foods unleash a packaging tsunami of wrappers, plastics, and cardboard that dwarfs the needs of fresh produce. While they whisper of biodegradable alternatives, the grim reality is that most of this waste chokes our landfills and poisons our oceans. Don't be fooled by claims of innovation; the truth is that processed foods generate a staggering amount of waste. We must focus on reducing packaging at the source by embracing whole, unprocessed foods.<br><br>The claim that processed foods enhance food security is a dangerous delusion. They create food *insecurity*. These foods are often calorie-rich but nutrient-poor, fueling a global health crisis of obesity and related diseases. We are sacrificing genuine nourishment for empty calories.<br><br>They conveniently ignore the brutal reality of industry consolidation. They suggest small businesses can flourish in the processed food sector. This is a fantasy. Large corporations are tightening their grip on the market, suffocating local farmers and dictating unsustainable practices. The small farmers don't stand a chance against these giants. These corporations can afford the high costs of marketing, distribution, and shelf placement that smaller farms simply cannot match. This imbalance of power leads to a system where small farmers are forced to sell their products at unfairly low prices or risk being driven out of business entirely.<br><br>The opposition glosses over the regulations and labeling requirements for additives, implying a guarantee of safety. This is a dangerous oversimplification. The sheer volume of artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives crammed into processed foods should raise alarm bells. Even if regulations are technically met, the long-term health consequences of consuming this chemical cocktail remain a grave concern. Many processed foods contain artificial colors, flavors, and preservatives that have been linked to potential health problems with long-term consumption .<br><br>They attempt to distract with talk of "innovation," but the high energy, water, and packaging demands of processed food production remain. They contribute significantly to resource depletion and environmental pollution. According to a study published in *Nature*, increased productivity has not improved efficiencies or reduced environmental impacts . Instead, resource-use intensities are excessively high regardless of crop yield . As Joseph Poore and Thomas Nemecek , published in the journal *Science*, the study looks at the environmental impacts of foods across more than 38,000 commercially viable farms in 119 countries . This chart compares emissions in kilograms of CO2eq produced per kilogram of food product . We need a fundamental shift in how we produce and consume food.<br><br>I urge you to reject the siren song of the processed food industry. Support local farmers markets, reduce your consumption of processed foods, and advocate for policies that support sustainable agriculture.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] The long-term health effects of consuming chemicals remain a serious concern.<br>[2] Nature.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chairperson and esteemed judges in today's debate our discussion has centered on a crucial question. Can processed foods play a vital role in a sustainable food system. Our opponents have painted a distorted picture attempting to cast processed foods as the enemy of sustainability. But we are not advocating for an exclusive reliance on processed foods instead we firmly believe that a strategic expansion of technologically advanced processed foods is essential to unlock a truly sustainable future. First let's dismantle their claims about food waste. They cry packaging tsunam. Yet they conveniently ignore the massive reduction in food waste that processing achieves. Processing slashes waste by extending shelf life and ensuring food safety. The nature communication study demonstrates this revealing how processing directly leads to less food being discarded. Furthermore innovative processing unlocks the potential to transform by-products such as fruit peels into valuable resources like pectin maximizing efficiency. Both fresh and processed foods generate waste but only processed foods offer this unique pathway to minimize waste through by-product utilization. Second. Their portrayal of processed foods as inherently nutrient poor is simply inaccurate they disregard the powerful impact of food fortification a proven strategy to combat malnutrition worldwide. Fortified cereals and carefully selected minimally processed options like canned tomatoes deliver essential nutrients. We acknowledge that some processed foods are less healthy but this stems from dietary choices not an intrinsic flaw of processing. As the sustainable nutrition initiative emphasizes food processing enhances nutrient availability.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Nature. 2024.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let's be clear: the processed food industry's vision of sustainability is a mirage. We've demonstrated that their pursuit of efficiency comes at the expense of genuine well-being.<br><br>Increasing our reliance on processed foods undermines the livelihoods of small farmers who are the backbone of sustainable agriculture. These foods contribute to a health crisis by offering nutrient-poor options that are often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Furthermore, the excessive packaging required for processed foods exacerbates our planet's waste problem.<br><br>Our opponents have failed to adequately address these critical issues. Their arguments about "food fortification" conveniently ignore the fundamental nutritional deficiencies inherent in many processed foods. Their claims of "innovation" disregard the significant environmental consequences of resource-intensive production methods. They attempt to sidestep ethical concerns by prioritizing profit over public health and environmental responsibility.<br><br>Think about the real-world implications. Would a small farmer, struggling to make a living, trust the promises of processed food giants? Would a parent, trying to feed their family healthy food on a budget, choose processed foods filled with artificial ingredients? The answer is obvious.<br><br>We've proven that prioritizing processed foods is not a sustainable path forward. It's a path that leads to environmental damage, economic inequality, and increased health risks for all. We urge you to reject this dangerous proposition and instead support food systems that value people, the planet, and long-term sustainability over short-term profits.</div>
