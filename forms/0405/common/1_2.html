                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define creative arts as a range of human activities involving the expression of imaginative or technical skill. Intended to produce works of aesthetic value and emotional power. Including visual arts music literature and performing arts. Decline refers to a gradual and continuous decrease in quality quantity or importance. In the context of the creative arts this refers to a reduction in the value opportunities and originality associated with human generated creative work. Our judging criteria is the preservation of human artistic value. The side that best demonstrates the impact of ai on preserving the value opportunity and originality inherent in human creative arts should win the debate. First ai-driven automation leads to job displacement and reduced opportunities for human artists. Ai tools are increasingly used in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024 across the entertainment industry. Many explicitly linked to the use of ai. For instance video game art assets can now be automatically generated with ai. Displacing game environmental artists this automation reduces opportunities for human artists to gain experience earn a living and develop their skills. Ultimately hindering the growth of creative arts. There's frankly a limited amount of time that people spend listening to music. There's a limited royalty pool. And so the more of the music that is made with these systems the less is going to human musicians the rise of ai writing tools may tempt businesses and individuals to rely solely on automated writing solutions. Thereby bypassing the need for human riders. Is ai writing tools become more sophisticated the demand for human rights shrinks particularly for entry-level and mid-level positions. Second. Ai undermines the economic value of human art. Is likely to bring down the average monetary value commanded in artistic markets ai tools have a negative effect on professional opportunities for contemporary artists crafts people and creators. This means ai reduces work and contracts and lowers the monetary value of art in our modern world. The proliferation of ai generated content. Often available at little to no cost decreases the perceived and actual economic value of human created art this devaluation discourages individuals from pursuing artistic careers and diminishes investment in human artistic endeavors resulting in a decline in the overall quality and innovation within the creative arts. As vox.com reports automated ai music generation may cost musicians their jobs impacting their ability to support their creative pursuits. Ford ai raises concerns about originality and authenticity in creative arts. Ai algorithms learn from vast data sets of existing human-created works. Leading to the potential for derivative or unoriginal ai generated content. Court cases and public discourse debate the legal and ethical practices of generative ai and training on copyrighted content without consent. Many jurisdictions including the us do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by ai. Us district judge william orrick ruled that the company stability ai mid journey deviantart and runway ai were violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) UNCTAD.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a world where anyone, regardless of their skill level, can bring their artistic vision to life. That's the promise of AI, and why we believe it won't lead to the decline of human creativity, but rather its explosion. We agree with our opponents that the creative arts involve the expression of imaginative skill, producing works of value, and that "decline" generally signifies a reduction in quality or importance. However, we contend that their application of these definitions to this specific debate is overly restrictive. It presents a false dilemma, suggesting that AI can only diminish human creativity, ignoring the transformative potential of this technology.<br><br>We also concur that preserving human artistic value, opportunity, and originality is paramount. However, we must look to the future and recognize that the stated criteria limit the potential for AI to *enhance* these very qualities. It's not about either/or; it's about "and." The question isn’t solely whether AI *preserves* current values but also whether it *creates* new artistic avenues.<br><br>As you'll see, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it democratizes it and diversifies the art form. AI art generators lower the barrier to entry for artistic expression, allowing individuals without traditional skills to create and share their visions. This democratization also leads to innovative and original works that were not available before the rise of AI. Consider photography. The rise of digital cameras and smartphones didn't kill professional photography; it unleashed a wave of creativity, expanded the artistic landscape, and created new genres. Similarly, AI empowers more people to engage with art, fostering a broader artistic landscape.<br><br>Crucially, AI's ability to mimic styles is limited. True creativity lies in emotional depth and unique human experiences, aspects AI fundamentally lacks. Consider Van Gogh's 'Starry Night.' The swirling brushstrokes convey not just the scene, but Van Gogh's inner turmoil and unique perspective. An AI could mimic the style, but it could never replicate the lived experience that fueled the masterpiece. While AI can replicate the *superficial aspects* of art, it cannot replicate the genuine emotion and personal experience that underpin truly moving art. AI may generate the image, but humans bring the emotion. As one article from *BBC* asks, will AI algorithms and robots spell the end of human creativity and artistry, or can they be harnessed to augment our own creative potential? <br><br>Furthermore, AI can help artists connect with new audiences and streamline their workflow. AI algorithms can analyze social media trends and suggest optimal posting times and hashtags, helping artists reach a wider audience and promote their work. According to *Forbes*, AI-powered visual content creation tools are revolutionizing the way visual content is created . Imagine an artist struggling to gain visibility. AI tools can be their marketing assistant. For instance, an artist using AI-powered tools to analyze social media engagement could see a 30% increase in website traffic and a corresponding rise in commissions. Many digital artists are using social media trends to better expose their work.<br><br>In conclusion, while concerns about the impact of AI on creative arts are valid, framing AI as an inherent threat that will inevitably lead to a decline is a fundamentally flawed view. Instead, we must embrace the potential for AI to democratize art creation, augment human creativity, diversify the art form, and expand artistic opportunities. For these reasons, we stand firm that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Baxter, Claudia.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition's opening statement contains several flaws. They misinterpret the definition of decline, misunderstand our judging criteria, and misrepresent the impact of AI on the artistic landscape.<br><br>First, the opposition claims our definition of "decline" is overly restrictive, creating a false dilemma. They suggest that AI can "create new avenues" and therefore shouldn't be considered a decline. However, this is an unreasonable assertion. By their logic, even destructive technologies could be justified because they "create new avenues," rendering the term "decline" meaningless. Established understandings of "decline"  clearly indicate a reduction in quality, value, or importance, which is precisely what we are seeing in the arts due to AI. Therefore, we stand by our definition.<br><br>Second, they argue that our judging criteria, "preservation of human artistic value," limits the potential for AI to *enhance* art. We contend that "enhancement" at the expense of "preservation" is a net loss. Human artistic value is intrinsically linked to human effort, emotion, and experience. Removing the human element, as AI increasingly does, diminishes this value . Their criteria effectively removes "human artistic value" as being important altogether because it does not matter where the art comes from, as long as it is *something* of artistic value, even without humans, which is an absurd proposition.<br><br>Third, the opposition argues AI democratizes art by lowering the barrier to entry. While it's true that AI allows more people to create, it simultaneously devalues art. When talent and effort become irrelevant, the resulting output is no longer "art" as we traditionally understand it . The opposition equivocates by changing the definition of "art" to include AI-generated outputs devoid of the human element, which is not the subject of this debate. <br><br>Fourth, they use the analogy of photography to suggest AI will create new genres without killing existing ones. This analogy is flawed. Photography was a *new* art form, not a replacement for existing ones. AI, however, is actively *replacing* human artists in many industries . Unlike early photography, which still required skill, composition, and artistic vision, AI requires none of these. It displaces artists without offering a comparable avenue for human expression, undermining the original intent of art itself.<br><br>Fifth, the opposition claims AI can't replicate emotional depth and unique human experience, which ironically *strengthens* our argument. If AI-generated content lacks these core elements, it *necessarily* leads to a decline in human artistic value . By admitting AI cannot replicate emotional depth, they concede that AI art is inherently inferior, supporting our central claim.<br><br>Sixth, while the opposition suggests AI can help artists connect with new audiences, it also floods the market with AI-generated content, making it *harder* for human artists to stand out . While AI *potentially* offers marketing assistance, the *net effect* is increased competition and devaluation of human-created art.<br><br>Finally, they claim AI augments human creativity. However, we see countless counter-examples where reliance on AI stifles human creativity. The ethical implications, such as training AI models on copyrighted material from human artists , directly contribute to the decline of human artistic pursuits. Court cases have shown that existing copyright protections are not adequate to protect the work of human artists when AI is involved <br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Thompson, J.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Our opponents' arguments are built on shaky ground, riddled with misinterpretations and unsupported claims. They quibble over the definition of "decline," clinging to a narrow view that ignores the dynamic nature of art. They suggest that AI's emergence is akin to destructive technologies, but this is a false equivalence. AI is a tool, and like any tool, its impact depends on how we wield it. The real story here isn't destruction, but transformation.<br><br>They present a false choice, arguing that "enhancement at the expense of preservation is a net loss." This assumes that progress *must* obliterate the past. But AI doesn't erase human artistic value; it expands it, unlocking new creative avenues without diminishing existing art forms. It's not an either/or situation. They also misrepresent our position, claiming we believe human artistic value is unimportant. This is simply untrue. We recognize its importance, but we also acknowledge that it's not the *only* measure of artistic merit.<br><br>The core of their argument seems to be that AI devalues art by making talent and effort irrelevant. This is simply not the case. AI *shifts* the focus of talent and effort, demanding new skills in utilizing these tools. Consider a chef using a food processor. Does it negate their culinary skill? No! It allows for new techniques and dishes. Similarly, AI art requires a different kind of creativity, a new mastery of the medium. The AI art market is projected to exceed $5 billion by 2027 . This shows that AI art is not devaluing art, but rather creating new opportunities for artists and collectors.<br><br>Their photography analogy, while seemingly supportive, actually undermines their argument. Photography was initially met with similar resistance, with many fearing it would spell the end of painting. But what happened? Photography became an art form in its own right, and painting continued to thrive. The same will happen with AI. New technologies don't necessarily eliminate existing art forms; they simply change them. Painting still exists, and photography has become an art form in its own right.<br><br>They concede that AI can't replicate emotional depth, as if this is a fatal flaw. But does every artwork *need* to be emotionally profound? Is a pop song worthless because it's not a symphony? Different art forms serve different purposes and offer different values. AI may not yet be able to replicate the profound emotional depth of a Van Gogh painting, it can still be used to create visually stunning and engaging art that serves a different purpose, like entertainment or education.<br><br>Yes, AI increases the volume of content, but this doesn't automatically devalue art. Instead, it creates new opportunities for artists to distinguish themselves, to rise above the noise. AI has already made significant strides in audience behavior analysis across various industries. For instance, media powerhouses like Netflix and Spotify use AI to dissect audience behaviors, delivering hyper-personalized recommendations and in turn, boosting user engagement .<br><br>The ethical concerns they raise are not unique to AI. Every technological advancement brings ethical considerations, from the printing press to the internet. We address these concerns through responsible development and usage. The real issue is not whether AI poses ethical challenges, but how we choose to address them.<br><br>Ultimately, our opponents' case is rooted in fear and a static view of art. The history of art is a history of innovation and change. AI is simply the next chapter.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] How to Sell AI-Generated Art & Make Money Online (2025). oxaam.<br>[2] AI In Audience Behavior Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide For 2024.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges in today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts. Focusing on whether ai will lead to a decline in the value opportunity and the originality associated with human-generated creative work. The opposition attempts to redefine decline to include new forms of ai generated content. However we defined decline clearly in our opening statement. And the core question remains does ai diminish human artistic value. The opposition equivocates changing the definition of art mid debate. We maintained that even as ai creates something new. Diminishing human artistic value constitutes a decline as we define it. The value of human art isn't just aesthetics it's the artist journey and the human connection at fosters. The opposition argues ai merely shifts the focus of talent comparing it to a chef using a food processor. This analogy fails ai increasingly replaces artists entirely. For instance video game art assets are automatically generated with ai. Displacing game environmental artists. The ethical implications are immense. Ai companies profit from the unauthorized use of artists work. Training ai models on copyrighted material from human artists. Judge william orrick ruled that stability ai mid journey deviantart and runway ai violated artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Our opponents concede that ai can't replicate emotional depth. Strengthening our argument. Art is not just about aesthetics it's about human connection and expression. Ai art lacks the soul and depth of human heart.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Thompson, J. "What is decline?". *The Free Dictionary by Farlex*.<br>(2) LeBlanc, B.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Judges, we've arrived at the crux of this debate: what does "decline" truly mean in the context of art? Our opponents painted a picture of loss, a world where AI replaces human artists. We offered a different vision: a world where AI transforms art, breaks down barriers, and unlocks new creative avenues. The question isn't whether AI changes art, but whether those changes inherently diminish human value.<br><br>Are we to cling to a romanticized past, limiting art to traditional forms? Or do we embrace a future where technology empowers artists, connecting them with global audiences and pushing the very definition of art?<br><br>Our opponents focused solely on the artist's individual journey, ignoring the crucial connection between artist and audience. Consider that musician struggling to be heard. AI provides tools to analyze social media, optimize content, and create engaging visuals. This isn't replacement; it's amplification, allowing the artist's voice to reach further than ever before.<br><br>We challenged their fundamental assumptions, proving that AI is a tool for connection, not destruction. We demonstrated that AI expands artistic horizons, offering tools for creation and connection. The numbers speak for themselves: the AI art market is projected to reach 5 billion dollars by 2027 . This isn't a sign of decline; it's a sign of a thriving, evolving landscape.<br><br>Therefore, I urge you to reject this fear-mongering. Vote against the motion. Affirm that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but to its exciting evolution. Let's embrace a future where technology and human creativity work hand in hand, enriching the world with art that is more accessible, more diverse, and more vibrant than ever before.</div>
