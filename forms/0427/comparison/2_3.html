                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that financial literacy, defined as the understanding of how money works encompassing budgeting, saving, investing, and responsible credit use, should be a required course in schools. This ensures all students gain crucial financial skills, regardless of background.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing long-term student well-being. We believe the judge should prioritize the side that best promotes students' lasting financial health and success. This aligns with education's goal of preparing students for a secure future.<br><br>First, a required financial literacy course demonstrably improves financial decision-making. Students gain essential skills in budgeting, saving, and debt management. For instance, a 2023 report by Champlain College found that financial literacy lessons have an "overwhelmingly" positive impact on students’ future financial habits . Moreover, research indicates that students who receive financial education in high school exhibit better financial outcomes as adults, including less debt and an improved quality of life . This directly contributes to long-term student well-being by providing the tools necessary for responsible financial management, reducing the risk of debt accumulation and promoting financial stability.<br><br>Second, financial literacy enhances economic opportunity, particularly for students of color who often face unique financial challenges . By providing all students with a foundational understanding of financial principles, they are empowered to make informed decisions about education, career paths, and investments. Studies show that financial literacy equips individuals to budget, save, and invest wisely, securing their futures . It allows them to break free from cycles of poverty and build lasting intergenerational wealth. Ultimately, this contributes to long-term student well-being by equipping students with the financial knowledge necessary to take advantage of opportunities and improve their socioeconomic standing.<br><br>Third, integrating financial literacy reduces financial stress and improves mental health. Managing finances poorly causes significant stress and anxiety, negatively impacting students' well-being. Equipping students with effective financial management skills lowers stress and enhances mental well-being . Informed financial decisions lead to peace of mind, as mentioned by USC's career blog . By fostering a mindset that views budgeting and managing money as empowering rather than restrictive, financial literacy contributes significantly to students' overall happiness and success.<br><br>In conclusion, requiring financial literacy in schools is crucial. It equips students with vital skills for improved financial decisions, promotes economic opportunity, and reduces financial stress, all contributing to their long-term well-being. We urge the judge to support our position and invest in the future financial success of all students.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss a critical issue impacting the future of our students: whether financial literacy should be a required course in schools. We firmly believe that it should.<br><br>Let's clarify what we mean by "financial literacy." It's more than just balancing a checkbook. It encompasses the knowledge and skills needed to make informed and effective decisions with all your financial resources. This includes budgeting, saving, investing, understanding debt, and navigating the complexities of the financial world.<br><br>Our judging criterion for this debate is straightforward: Which side best demonstrates the potential to improve the financial well-being of students? We contend that equipping students with financial knowledge is the key to unlocking their future success.<br><br>As you'll see, financial literacy is not just an advantage; it's a necessity, especially for those who need it most.<br><br>Our first crucial argument is that mandatory financial literacy empowers students from disadvantaged backgrounds to break cycles of poverty by fostering informed financial decision-making. Students from low-income families often lack exposure to sound financial practices. A required course levels the playing field, providing essential knowledge and skills for managing money, saving, and investing, thus increasing economic mobility. As *Forbes* reported in 2024, financial literacy empowers individuals to navigate economic systems and leverage opportunities for wealth accumulation, helping to bridge the stark disparities in financial well-being. Think of it like this: Financial literacy is a ladder that helps students climb out of financial hardship.<br><br>Moving beyond empowering disadvantaged students, financial literacy also addresses critical gender disparities in financial knowledge. Studies indicate that women often have lower levels of financial literacy than men. A required course ensures that all students, regardless of gender, have access to essential financial knowledge, empowering women to make informed financial decisions and secure their financial future. *Forbes* reported in 2024 that while 52% of U.S. women achieved financial literacy, a gap remains compared to 62% of men. This highlights the importance of targeted financial education to address gender-based challenges.<br><br>Finally, and perhaps most urgently, by promoting informed financial decision-making, financial literacy education reduces reliance on high-cost alternative financial services like payday loans and check-cashing services. These services often trap vulnerable individuals in cycles of debt. Financial literacy education provides the knowledge and skills to avoid these services and access more affordable financial options. According to a 2023 report by Champlain College featured on *Edutopia*, financial literacy lessons have an overwhelmingly positive impact on students’ future financial habits, from budgeting and saving to avoiding predatory loans. Financial literacy acts as a protective shield, safeguarding students from predatory practices.<br><br>While implementing a new required course may present logistical challenges, incorporating financial literacy into existing curricula or offering it as a semester-long elective can mitigate these concerns.<br><br>In conclusion, requiring financial literacy in schools isn't just a good idea, it's a necessary step toward ensuring a brighter, more equitable future for all students. We are confident that our arguments clearly demonstrate the profound benefits of financial literacy education. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that mandating financial literacy as a required course in schools is not the most effective approach to promoting financial well-being, as it diverts resources from other crucial areas of education and may not lead to lasting behavioral change.<br>Our judging criteria is educational efficacy and resource allocation. We believe the most effective educational policies maximize positive student outcomes while minimizing the consumption of limited resources, including time, funding, and personnel. We will demonstrate that mandating financial literacy is not the best use of these resources compared to other educational investments or alternative approaches to financial education.<br><br>First, mandatory financial literacy courses are ineffective in changing long-term financial behavior. While proponents argue these courses equip students with essential knowledge, studies show that such education often fails to translate into lasting behavioral changes . For instance, a study by the Fordham Institute found school-delivered financial literacy courses largely ineffectual, with personal habits, life experiences, and access to financial knowledge as an adult being far more influential . This suggests that simply mandating a course does not guarantee improved financial habits.<br><br>Second, requiring financial literacy creates curriculum overload and significant opportunity costs. Integrating financial literacy into already packed school curricula raises concerns about overload, with many educators worried about adding to existing workloads . This additional burden can lead to student stress and burnout, negatively impacting academic performance . As curriculum overload results in stress and reduces student engagement, it can lower achievement levels . Furthermore, the opportunity cost of mandating financial literacy means sacrificing other potentially valuable subjects . Schools may have to cut back on arts, humanities, or other STEM courses to accommodate this new requirement, potentially hindering students' overall educational development.<br><br>Third, alternative approaches to financial literacy are more effective and flexible. Instead of a mandatory course, integrating financial literacy into existing subjects like math and social studies, or offering optional workshops and online resources, allows for tailored learning experiences that cater to diverse student needs and interests . These methods are more adaptable and less resource-intensive. For example, stand-alone personal finance courses would be a more comprehensive option . Moreover, community-based initiatives and online tools can provide accessible and relevant financial education, reaching a broader audience and accommodating different learning styles .<br><br>In conclusion, while financial literacy is undoubtedly important, mandating it as a required course is not the most effective solution.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss whether financial literacy should be a required course in schools. While we acknowledge the importance of financial literacy, we firmly believe that mandating it is not the most effective or equitable approach.<br><br>Let's begin by defining "financial literacy." Our opponents likely define it narrowly, focusing on budgeting, saving, and investing. While these are important components, a truly comprehensive understanding of financial literacy extends far beyond. It encompasses understanding the complexities of the economy, how government policies impact personal finances, and how global events can ripple through individual financial situations. This broader definition is crucial because it highlights the limitations of a standardized course. Mandating a course that attempts to cover such a vast scope would be unwieldy and ultimately less effective.<br><br>Now, regarding the judging criteria, our opponents may argue that long-term student well-being should be the primary focus. Of course, we agree that it's important. However, education is about more than just preparing for a secure financial future. It's about fostering critical thinking, creativity, and a lifelong love of learning. We must consider all aspects of a student’s development, not just their potential financial success.<br><br>So, why are we against making financial literacy a required course? Our first argument is that it neglects the diversity of student needs and interests. A "one-size-fits-all" approach simply doesn't work. Not every student aspires to be a financial expert. Many students are passionate about the arts, humanities, or skilled trades. Forcing them into a standardized financial literacy course could stifle their passions and limit their opportunities to excel in other areas. It's akin to forcing every athlete to train for the marathon, even if they are naturally gifted sprinters. Instead, we should focus on personalized learning approaches that cater to individual student needs and aspirations.<br><br>Second, effective financial literacy is best learned through real-world experience. It's about managing a personal budget, participating in investment simulations, or receiving guidance from a financial mentor. A classroom setting simply cannot replicate these experiences. As highlighted in *a 2022 study published in Frontiers*, experiential learning methods and life-event-focused content significantly enhance the effectiveness of financial education. It's like trying to learn how to swim by reading a book; you need to get in the water.<br><br>Finally, focusing solely on financial literacy deflects attention from the larger issue of systemic economic inequalities. Many individuals struggle financially not because they lack knowledge, but because they face systemic barriers such as low wages, limited access to affordable healthcare, and discriminatory lending practices. According to *a study in the UIC John Marshall Law Review*, ordinary citizens have little to no independent influence on policy decisions due to the deep entrenchment of money in American politics. Therefore, even financially literate individuals from marginalized communities may struggle to overcome these systemic barriers. It's like putting a band-aid on a broken leg; we need to address the root causes of financial insecurity.<br><br>Instead of a mandatory course, we propose alternative approaches such as integrating financial literacy concepts into existing subjects like math and social studies, offering optional workshops and extracurricular activities, and promoting online resources and mentorship programs.<br><br>Therefore, we urge you to vote against the motion and instead advocate for policies that empower students through tailored education and address the root causes of economic inequality.<br>***<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three key flaws, specifically their overly broad definition of financial literacy, their misrepresentation of our stance on long-term student well-being, and their arguments regarding the practicality and impact of financial literacy education.<br><br>First, the opposition attempts to define financial literacy so broadly that it becomes impractical for a high school course. While understanding the complexities of the global economy is beneficial, the core skills of budgeting, saving, investing, and responsible credit use are fundamental . Studies show that focusing on these practical skills equips students with essential tools for making informed financial decisions . Insisting that a financial literacy course must cover everything from government policy to global events is like arguing that a basic math class must delve into advanced calculus. It's an unreasonable expectation that obscures the real value of providing a solid foundation in personal finance .<br><br>Second, our opponents suggest that prioritizing financial literacy somehow diminishes the importance of critical thinking, creativity, and a love of learning. However, financial literacy directly supports these very qualities. Making informed financial decisions requires critical thinking. Finding innovative solutions to financial challenges fosters creativity. And understanding how money works can spark curiosity about economics and business . By empowering students to manage their finances effectively, we are not limiting their horizons, but rather providing them with the means to pursue their passions with greater confidence and security .<br><br>Third, the opposition argues that a "one-size-fits-all" financial literacy course neglects the diversity of student needs. However, core subjects like math and English are also required, because they provide essential skills for everyone . Moreover, financial literacy equips all students with universally applicable knowledge, regardless of their career paths . It's a false dilemma to suggest that students must choose between financial literacy and other subjects . Furthermore, basic financial literacy teaches necessary skills for college, such as how loans work and how to avoid predatory loans.<br><br>Fourth, they claim that financial literacy is best learned through real-world experience, not in the classroom. While real-world experience is valuable, it needs a foundation. Students need to learn the basics of budgeting, saving, and investing before they can effectively apply those skills in real-world scenarios . A classroom setting can provide this essential foundation through simulations, case studies, and guest speakers, preparing students to navigate the complexities of personal finance with greater confidence . They cannot claim that only real world experience matters, as they learned the information they now use from prior instruction .<br><br>Finally, our opponents suggest that focusing on financial literacy deflects attention from systemic economic inequalities. However, financial literacy empowers individuals to navigate these inequalities more effectively. While financial literacy may not solve systemic problems, it equips individuals with the knowledge and skills to make the best possible choices within the existing system . Knowing how finances and laws work is important and helpful in the face of financial inequality, and not knowing simply puts those in need at an even greater disadvantage .<br><br>In conclusion, the negative side’s arguments are unfounded. Therefore, we continue to advocate that requiring financial literacy in schools is crucial for equipping students with the tools they need to thrive in an increasingly complex financial world.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">They acknowledge the importance of financial literacy, but argue that mandating it is ineffective and inequitable. However, the crucial issue here is access. We believe that requiring financial literacy ensures that *all* students have access to this essential knowledge, leveling the playing field. The value of a mandatory course is that it ensures equitable access, whereas optional programs risk excluding those most in need. It’s like other fundamental skills. We don't leave reading or math to chance; we ensure every student receives a baseline understanding.<br><br>The claim that a mandatory financial literacy course neglects the diversity of student needs misses a key point. It's like saying learning to read is pointless if you want to be a musician. Financial literacy is a universally applicable life skill. Consider this: financial literacy provides a foundational skill set applicable to all career paths. Artists need to manage their income, and scientists need to understand research grants. According to *Forbes in 2024*, financial literacy empowers individuals to take control of their finances and navigate the challenges and opportunities that arise. Basic financial knowledge empowers individuals to succeed in any field.<br><br>You say that effective financial literacy is best learned through real-world experience, and this is true. However, real-world experience isn't always available for everyone. It’s like learning grammar. While real-world practice is valuable, a standardized course provides that foundation, allowing for more productive and insightful individual guidance later on. Mentorship is far more effective when students possess a base level of financial understanding.<br><br>Now, about systemic economic inequalities. We agree that these issues are important. However, financial literacy provides individuals with the tools to navigate and mitigate the impact of these inequalities. They are not mutually exclusive, but mutually reinforcing. We agree that addressing systemic economic inequalities is crucial, and we support policies that promote economic justice. However, financial literacy is not a substitute for these efforts; it's a complementary tool that empowers individuals, particularly those from marginalized communities, to make informed financial decisions and build wealth despite these challenges. Furthermore, financially literate citizens are more likely to advocate for policies that address these systemic issues. As *Medium* reported, financial literacy is a powerful tool for empowering women, promoting gender equality, and closing the gender wealth gap.<br><br>Finally, remember that our goal is to set students up for a lifetime of success. By prioritizing financial health, we empower them to make informed decisions that will positively impact their lives. This aligns perfectly with education’s goal of long-term well-being, preparing students for a secure and fulfilling future. It’s like equipping a ship for a long voyage; financial literacy provides the necessary charts and compass to navigate the complexities of life.<br><br>Ultimately, the most important judging criterion should be which approach best prepares students for long-term well-being. While academic knowledge is important, it's incomplete without the practical skills to manage one's finances. A mandatory financial literacy course ensures that all students, regardless of their background, have the opportunity to build a secure and fulfilling future. This is not just about money; it's about empowering individuals to live their best lives.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition's rebuttals contain several flaws, specifically regarding the definition of financial literacy, the importance of mandatory financial literacy, the applicability of financial literacy to different careers, the necessity of real-world experience, and the ability of financial literacy to solve systemic inequality.<br><br>First, the opposition claims our definition of financial literacy is too broad, but even their "core skills" require a broader economic understanding . For example, understanding interest rates, a "core skill," requires understanding how government policies and economic trends influence them. A narrow focus on budgeting and saving without this context provides a limited and potentially misleading picture. We must remember that financial literacy is more than just balancing a checkbook; it’s about understanding the world that shapes our financial realities .<br><br>Second, the opposition suggests prioritizing financial literacy enhances creativity, but mandating a specific course forces students to spend time on a subject misaligned with their passions . The opposition claims financial literacy leads to well-being, but well-being often stems from pursuing one's passions. Forcing all students into a financial literacy course means they miss out on exploring other subjects they might be more passionate about, like art or music. The opportunity cost is significant .<br><br>Third, the opposition argues that financial literacy is as universally applicable as math and English, but this simply isn't true . While math and English are foundational across nearly all fields, a student pursuing a career in the arts might benefit more from additional art classes than a mandatory financial literacy course. We must prioritize personalized learning approaches that allow students to focus on their strengths and interests, rather than forcing them into a "one-size-fits-all" curriculum .<br><br>Fourth, the opposition claims that financial literacy needs a foundation before real-world experience, but this doesn't necessitate a mandatory course . Financial literacy concepts can be effectively integrated into existing subjects like math or social studies, as we initially proposed . Moreover, studies show that financial literacy programs in schools often lack long-term effectiveness. In fact, a study by the Fordham Institute shows, personal habits, life experiences, and access to financial knowledge as an adult are far more impactful on financial literacy than schooling .<br><br>Finally, the opposition suggests that financial literacy empowers individuals to navigate systemic economic inequalities, but equipping someone with financial knowledge doesn't solve the problem if they lack access to opportunities . Systemic issues like low wages and discriminatory lending practices require policy changes, not just individual financial knowledge. Knowing finances and laws is important and helpful in the face of financial inequality, and not knowing simply puts those in need at an even greater disadvantage. Therefore financial literacy is a band aid on a bullet wound .<br><br>In conclusion, we continue to believe that while financial literacy is important, it should not be a mandatory course in schools.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let's get straight to the heart of the matter. First, regarding their definition, my opponent presents a view of financial literacy that is far too limited. They define it in a way that only scratches the surface, like calling someone who can apply a band-aid a fully qualified doctor. A true understanding of finance requires grasping the larger economic forces at play. It demands an understanding of how government policies, global events, and broader economic shifts impact personal finances. This isn't just an opinion; it's a fundamental reality that their definition overlooks.<br><br>Second, my opponent argues that financial literacy helps students follow their passions. But this is akin to saying that learning to hammer makes you an architect. While it might be a helpful skill, other subjects are far more effective at nurturing passions. The arts, sciences, and humanities directly engage with and cultivate these interests. Financial literacy is a useful tool, but it's no substitute for a well-rounded education that fosters diverse intellectual and creative pursuits.<br><br>Third, they claim financial literacy demonstrably improves decision-making, citing a report from Champlain College. However, we must ask: is one report truly representative of the entire population? What about the significant impact of individual differences? Factors such as family background and personal experiences play a far more substantial role in shaping financial decision-making. Studies conducted in South Korea and Hong Kong, as reported in *Frontiers*, emphasize the impact of parental financial behaviors and experiences on shaping financial literacy, especially for adolescents from low-income families. Therefore, before we declare financial literacy the king of decision-making, let's acknowledge the full landscape of influences.<br><br>Fourth, our opponents suggest that the classroom provides a sufficient foundation for real-world financial experience. But that's like saying reading a cookbook makes you a chef. You need to get into the kitchen and cook! True financial literacy comes from managing a real budget, making actual investment decisions, and navigating the consequences of those choices. *Finsimco.com* emphasizes that experiential learning, through simulations and decision-based exercises, replicates the uncertainty and complexity of real financial environments, forcing students to make trade-offs and adjust strategies as conditions change. Those who learn by doing are far more likely to develop genuine financial competence.<br><br>Fifth, they contend that financial literacy helps navigate systemic inequalities. This is simply not the case. Focusing solely on individual financial skills while ignoring broader systemic issues is like giving someone swimming lessons and dropping them in the middle of the ocean. It's a fallacy of composition to assume that individual skills training addresses the root causes of low wages and limited access to healthcare. As highlighted by the *Center for American Progress*, shrinking the wealth gap requires large, targeted policy interventions. We need policy changes that address these inequalities directly, not just better budgeting skills.<br><br>In conclusion, while financial literacy has its place, it is not a panacea. We must not allow it to distract us from the more fundamental reforms needed to create a truly equitable society. Instead of mandating a one-size-fits-all financial literacy curriculum, let's focus on personalized learning approaches and systemic reforms that address the root causes of economic inequality. I urge you to consider the limitations of the proponent's arguments and instead prioritize a more holistic and effective approach to education and economic empowerment.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chairperson and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the core skills and purpose of financial literacy in schools. If it should be a required course. First the opposition defines financial literacy too broadly rendering it impractical. They claim it's like giving someone a band-aid and calling them a doctor. However insisting financial literacy cover all aspects of the global economy. Is like saying a basic first aid course must train you to perform open heart surgery. Both provide essential foundational skills. Our focus is on equipping students with core skills in budgeting saving and responsible credit use. These are achievable and fundamental providing a solid foundation for future financial decisions. Second they suggest financial literacy detracts from other passions however financial literacy supports students in pursuing their passions by providing financial security. It's a compliment not a replacement. Learning to play an instrument requires both practice and understanding the financial aspect. Such as buying the instrument or paying for lessons. While the opposition questions the representativeness of the champlain college report. Multiple studies support our stance. Research indicates that financial literacy lessons positively impact students financial habits. While family background matters. Are coarse aims to level the playing field. Equipping all students with essential knowledge. Breaking cycles of poor financial habits. They claim real-world experience is superior to classroom learning. Comparing it to reading a cookbook versus being a chef. However learning to cook requires both recipes and practice you need recipes to know what ingredients to use. Our course provides those recipes. Finally the opposition suggests financial literacy doesn't address systemic inequalities.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The heart of this debate is simple: should we give all students the financial skills they need to succeed? We firmly believe the answer is yes, through a required financial literacy course. While our opponents propose other ways, their ideas just don't measure up.<br><br>We've shown how financial literacy, built on the basics of budgeting, saving, and using credit wisely, sets students up for a better future. It gives them more chances to succeed financially and lowers their stress levels. Our opponents, on the other hand, make financial literacy so general that it's hard to put into practice. They also create a fake problem, suggesting that focusing on money skills somehow takes away from other interests. But learning about money actually helps students chase any dream they have.<br><br>They also argue that real-world experience is the best way to learn. We agree that experience is important, but it needs a base of knowledge, which our course provides. Plus, they claim that financial literacy doesn't fix unfair systems. While it's not a complete fix, it does give people the tools to deal with these problems. According to *a 2021 report by the Brookings Institution*, financial literacy programs can empower individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds to make informed financial decisions and improve their economic mobility . The opposition doesn't offer any solutions to overcome systemic issues.<br><br>The opposition's plan leaves students unprepared for the real world. We offer a clear path to a more secure future. For the sake of our students' well-being and future success, we strongly encourage you to support financial literacy for all. As *the JumpStart Coalition for Personal Financial Literacy emphasized in 2022*, financial education is not just about managing money; it's about empowering individuals to achieve their life goals and contribute to society .

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the true meaning of financial literacy. And how best to empower students for long-term well-being. The affirmative side presents a view of financial literacy that is far too limited. Scratching the surface. They want a basic understanding of financial literacy. While we advocate for comprehensive one. Tru financial literacy requires grasping larger economic forces government policies global events and their impact on personal finances. A basic understanding leaves individuals vulnerable to exploitation and poor financial decisions. The claim that financial literacy helps students follow their passions is misleading. Well helpful it's no substitute for subjects that directly foster creativity and critical thinking. A poorly taught course can lead to resentment. Hindering future financial habits time spent on financial literacy could be better used on subjects that directly foster creativity and critical thinking. Mandatory courses lead to curriculum overload and students stress negatively impacting overall well-being. Citing a report from champlain college. They argue financial literacy improves decision making. What is one report representative? Individual differences and factors like family background play a significant role. They suggest the classroom provides a sufficient foundation for real-world experience. But true financial literacy comes from managing real budgets and making actual investment decisions. Those who learn by doing develop genuine competence. Finally they contend that financial literacy helps navigate systemic inequalities. Which is not the case? It's insufficient to overcome systemic barriers like low wages and discriminatory lending. Policy changes are needed to address these inequalities directly. Not just better budgeting skills. The core value at stake is empowerment.<br><br>

Our opponents champion a narrow, skills-based definition of financial literacy, while we advocate for addressing the deep-rooted systemic issues that perpetuate economic inequality and for personalized education.<br><br>We've demonstrated that a mandatory, one-size-fits-all course simply cannot address the diverse needs and passions of all students. Real-world experience, like managing a budget firsthand, is far more valuable than passively learning about it in a classroom. More importantly, we've shown that systemic inequalities, such as low wages and lack of access to healthcare, are far greater barriers to financial well-being than a simple lack of financial literacy. As the saying goes, giving someone a recipe is useless if they can't afford the ingredients.<br><br>Our opponents cling to an unrealistic definition of financial literacy, failing to grasp the overwhelming influence of broader economic forces on individual financial outcomes. Their limited scope ignores the harsh realities of many students' lives. Their overreliance on the *Champlain College report* neglects the crucial roles of family background, parental influences, and individual struggles in shaping financial capabilities.<br><br>Their vision is merely a superficial fix on a fundamentally broken system. We offer a comprehensive cure. Therefore, we urge you to oppose this motion. Instead, advocate for tailored educational approaches that truly empower individuals, alongside systemic changes that dismantle the economic barriers holding so many back. Our students deserve nothing less than a chance to thrive, not just survive.
