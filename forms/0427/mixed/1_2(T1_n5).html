                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let's begin by establishing a shared understanding. When we refer to "labor unions," specifically unions like the AFL-CIO, we're talking about organizations that represent workers, advocating for improved wages, better working conditions, and enhanced overall well-being. "Economic growth," in this context, signifies a sustained increase in a nation's production of goods and services, leading to higher standards of living for its citizens.<br><br>To fairly evaluate the benefits of labor unions, we propose a primary judging criterion: overall societal benefit. This encompasses not only the direct economic effects of unions but also their broader impact on workers' lives, the well-being of communities, and the equitable distribution of economic gains.<br><br>First, unions foster a more competitive marketplace by acting as a countervailing force to corporate dominance. Without unions, large corporations often dictate terms, potentially leading to monopolies that stifle innovation and harm consumers. Unions level the playing field, ensuring that businesses compete on merit, with better products, services, and working conditions. As the *U.S. Department of the Treasury* pointed out in their report on *Labor Unions and the U.S. Economy*, nonunionized firms in competition with unionized workplaces may choose to raise wages, change hiring practices, or improve their workplace environment to attract workers . This competition ultimately benefits consumers and drives economic growth.<br><br>Second, union-negotiated benefits, particularly healthcare and retirement plans, reduce the strain on public social safety nets. When workers have access to robust employer-sponsored benefits, they are less likely to rely on government assistance programs. It's like having a reliable private insurance policy that reduces the demand on public healthcare. According to *2020 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics*, 91 percent of union workers had access to a retirement plan compared to only 65 percent of nonunion workers . These employer contributions go into trust funds run by trustees selected by the union and the employers. By reducing the reliance on public funds for social safety nets, resources can be redirected towards education, infrastructure, and other essential services that benefit everyone, further stimulating economic growth.<br><br>Third, unions make critical investments in skills training through apprenticeship programs, equipping workers with valuable expertise for high-demand jobs. These programs ensure that the workforce possesses the skills necessary to thrive in a rapidly evolving economy. *Forbes* reported that companies achieve the best returns on investments in new technology when they merge implementation with complementary changes in work processes, employee training, and worker input . Moreover, unions actively promote diversity and inclusion in these programs. For example, *a study* found that registered apprenticeship programs conducted in partnership with a union register more Black, Latino and women workers than their non-union equivalents . By investing in human capital and promoting inclusivity, unions directly contribute to long-term economic growth and shared prosperity.<br><br>While some may argue that unions can sometimes resist innovation or protect underperforming workers, the evidence clearly demonstrates that their positive contributions to competition, reduced public burden, and skills training far outweigh these concerns. Unions are not relics of the past; they are vital engines for a more equitable and prosperous future. Therefore, we firmly believe that labor unions are indeed beneficial to economic growth.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that labor unions are not beneficial to economic growth. We define economic growth as an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. Typically measured by gross domestic product growth. We define a labor union as an organized association of workers. Often in a trade or profession. Form to protect and further their rights and interests are judging criteria is net positive contribution to gdp grow. The side that demonstrates the greatest positive net impact on gdp growth should win this debate. We can tend that labor unions on balance hinder rather than help economic growth. First labor unions increase labor costs reducing investment and hiring. Increase wages and benefits negotiated by unions raise production costs for businesses leading to decreased profitability. This in turn reduces investment in capital and hiring. Hindering economic expansion. When businesses face higher labor costs they have less capital available to invest in expansion? Innovation and job creation. Studies show that increased labor costs can lead to a significant reduction in investment. For example research indicates that every 1% increase in union wages leads to a 3% decrease in investment. This reduction in investment directly undermines economic growth by slowing down capital accumulation and technological progress. A recent study by harvard business review indicated that companies facing unionization saw a 10 to 15% reduction in capital investment compared to their non-union counterparts. The natural result is stifled innovation reduced competitiveness and slower gdp growth. Second labor unions reduce competitiveness. By increasing costs through higher wages and benefits and sometimes imposing restrictive work rules. Labor unions make unionized businesses less competitive compared to non-unionized businesses. Both domestically and internationally. This reduced competitiveness leads to decreased market share lower sales and ultimately slower economic growth. Businesses operating under union contracts often face significantly higher labor costs making it difficult to compete with companies that are not unionized or that operate in countries with lower labor costs. A study by the national association of manufacturers found that unionized manufacturing firms have labor costs that are on average 20% higher. The non-unionized fir. This cost disadvantage leads to a decline in production exports and overall economic activity. For example the economic policy institute found that states with higher union membership tend to have lower rates of manufacturing job growth. Third labor unions can contribute to inflation. Wage increases secured by labor unions can lead to inflationary pressures as businesses raise prices to cover the higher labor costs. This inflation can a road purchasing power and destabilize the economy. When unions negotiate wage increases that exceed productivity gains businesses are often forced to pass these costs on to consumers in the form of higher prices? This contributes to inflationary pressures reducing consumer purchasing power and dampening economic growth. Research by the federal reserve bank of st louis found a positive correlation between union wage increases and inflation rates particularly in sectors with strong union presence five. A study by the bureau of labor statistics indicated that industries with high unionization rates experienced higher rates of price increases compared to industries with low unionization rates. In conclusion labor unions hinder economic growth by increasing labor costs. Reducing competitiveness and contributing to inflation. For these reasons we strongly negate the resolution.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, everyone, let's get started. In this rebuttal, I'll clarify key points and address the arguments against labor unions, focusing on four main areas. First, I'll demonstrate how unions benefit economic growth. Second, I'll address the argument about increased labor costs, providing a more complete picture. Third, I'll discuss the claim of inflationary pressure, highlighting flaws in their reasoning. Finally, I will reinforce our key claims that unions are beneficial to economic growth. Our goal is to show that unions are a positive force for economic progress.<br><br>Let's dive in. Our opponents argue that labor unions are not beneficial to economic growth. We strongly disagree. They focus on cost while ignoring the bigger picture. Unions *do* promote economic growth by increasing worker productivity, reducing income inequality, and promoting social stability. Unions advocate for better training and safer working conditions, leading to a more skilled and motivated workforce. This translates to higher productivity and innovation, benefiting the entire economy.<br><br>Second, let's address concerns about increased labor costs. The claim is that higher union wages reduce investment and hiring. However, this assumes that higher labor costs always lead to decreased profitability, which isn't always true. Unionized firms often see increased productivity and innovation, offsetting those costs. *WorkRise Network* found that unions can improve business outcomes by helping firms hold on to tenured workers who tend to be more productive . This reduces turnover costs and supports investments in training. Furthermore, higher wages translate to increased consumer spending, stimulating demand and fueling economic growth. The evidence they presented may not fully account for these factors.<br><br>Third, let's talk about inflation. Our opponents suggest that union wage increases lead to inflationary pressures. But that's not the complete story. Wages often rise in response to existing inflation, not the other way around. Unions may negotiate higher wages to compensate workers for the rising cost of living. Plus, increased productivity from unionized workplaces can help absorb those wage increases without necessarily raising prices. Their cited study doesn't fully account for these factors.<br><br>Now, let's reinforce our key claims. Firstly, unions are a countervailing force to corporate dominance. They create a more competitive market. According to the *Economic Policy Institute*, union contracts establish wages for unionized workers, and nonunion employers raise wages to stay competitive . The *Economic Policy Institute* further reports that, on average, union workers earn 10.2% more than nonunion workers with similar education, experience, and occupation. Secondly, union-negotiated benefits reduce the strain on public social safety nets. For example, the *NIHCR* reports that unionized workers tend to have more comprehensive health benefits and lower patient cost sharing compared to nonunionized workers . Finally, unions make critical investments in skills training through apprenticeship programs. *SMART Union* reports that unions update their training regularly to anticipate technological changes, ensuring quality and safety .<br><br>Unions provide a vital safety net. They reduce the strain on public resources and ensure workers have the skills needed for a changing economy. These are investments in our society. That's the real definition of economic growth: shared prosperity and a better future for all. So, while our opponents focus on narrow cost concerns, we see the broader benefits. Unions are good for workers, good for communities, and good for economic growth.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal contains several flaws. We will address their defense of unions regarding the judging criteria, worker productivity, consumer spending, the risk of inflation, their effects on social safety nets, and the adaptability of job training.<br><br>First, the affirmative side asks us to judge this debate based on "overall societal benefit." However, this standard is far too broad and subjective . While societal benefits are certainly desirable, they are difficult to quantify and compare. Our criteria of net positive contribution to GDP growth provides a clear, measurable, and universally recognized indicator of economic well-being. Historically, GDP growth has strongly correlated with improved societal well-being, poverty reduction, and increased access to healthcare and education. If our economy isn't growing, then any societal benefit is unsustainable . <br><br>Second, our opponents claim that unions increase worker productivity through better training and working conditions, but this argument commits the fallacy of correlation versus causation. Do unions actually *cause* productivity increases, or do already productive industries simply attract unionization ? Evidence suggests that unions may, in fact, decrease productivity by increasing labor costs and imposing restrictive work rules. These rules can hinder innovation and efficiency .<br><br>Third, our opponents argue that higher union wages drive economic growth through increased consumer spending. However, these wage increases come directly from company profits, which could otherwise be reinvested in innovation, expansion, and job creation . Moreover, higher prices due to union wage demands will offset the benefit of increased wages and lead to reduced consumption, especially for non-union workers who do not receive the same benefit. Union wage demands don't grow the economy, they simply redistribute wealth .<br><br>Fourth, the wage increases secured by unions can indeed lead to inflationary pressures. When unions negotiate wage increases that exceed productivity gains, businesses are often forced to pass these costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices. This creates a wage-price spiral, where union wage demands lead to higher prices, which then lead to further wage demands . This hurts non-union workers and those on fixed incomes the most.<br><br>Fifth, we disagree with the claim that unions reduce the strain on public social safety nets. While union jobs, with their higher wages and benefits, may discourage workers from seeking government assistance, they also create a disincentive for innovation and flexibility in the labor market . This can potentially lead to higher unemployment in the long run, which ultimately *increases* reliance on social safety nets.<br><br>Sixth, while unions invest in skills training, these programs are often focused on specific trades and may not be as adaptable to changing economic conditions as private sector training programs . Additionally, access to these programs is typically limited to union members only, excluding a large portion of the workforce.<br><br>For these reasons, we maintain that labor unions are not beneficial to economic growth.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In conclusion, let's refocus on what truly defines progress in our society. While our opponents emphasize GDP growth, we argue that "overall societal benefit" provides a more comprehensive and equitable measure. We firmly believe that labor unions are essential for achieving this broader vision of progress.<br><br>First, let's address the issue of productivity. Our opponents claim that unions hinder productivity, but this argument commits a correlation/causation fallacy. Unions do not inherently *cause* decreased productivity. Instead, they *foster* worker retention and enhance skills. This investment leads to a more skilled and motivated workforce, ultimately boosting productivity.<br><br>Second, regarding inflation, our opponents contend that union wage increases drive inflation. However, wages often *respond* to existing inflationary pressures. Moreover, increased worker productivity, driven by union-led training and skill development, helps to absorb these costs. This is crucial because unions actively invest in skills training, which reduces the strain on public assistance programs.<br><br>Third, unions play a vital role in promoting competition and reducing social inequalities, paving the way for shared prosperity. They aren't solely about economics; they embody a commitment to social justice. By supporting unions, we invest in our communities and secure a fairer future for everyone.<br><br>In summary, we've demonstrated that labor unions are not merely beneficial but essential for a thriving society. They champion worker well-being, foster productivity, and reduce the burden on social safety nets. A vote for our side is a vote for a more equitable and prosperous society for all. Thank you.</div>

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the fundamental question of whether labor unions are genuinely beneficial to economic growth. And our team has demonstrated that. On balance they are not. Firstly we established that gdp growth is the superior metric for evaluating economic benefit. Because it is a clear measurable and universally recognized indicator. The opposing sides criterion of overall societal benefit is simply too broad and subjective. Making objective assessment impossible. While they claim unions foster competition reduce the strain on public safety nets and invest in training. These purported benefits are unsustainable without overall economic growth. An economy must grow to improve well-being. Reduce poverty and increase access to crucial services. Secondly the affirmative side argues that unions increase worker productivity. However they fail to prove causation. It's more likely that already productive industries attract unionization. Not the other way around. Union imposed work rules can stifle innovation and efficiency ultimately hindering productivity. Thirdly the wage increases secured by unions redistribute wealth rather than creating it. While union members may benefit. These games come at the expense of company prof. Which could be reinvested in expansion and job creation? Moreover these wage increases often lead to higher prices. Hurting non non-union workers and those on fixed incomes. This can create a wage price spiral further destabilizing the economy. Finally the affirmative claim that unions reduce the strain on social safety nets ignores the long-term consequences. By hindering innovation and flexibility unions can contribute to higher unemployment. Ultimately increasing the reliance on these very safety nets 6.<br><br>

While our opponents champion "societal benefit," we maintain that measurable GDP growth is the true indicator of progress.<br><br>"Societal benefit" is subjective and unquantifiable. GDP growth, however, provides a concrete metric of economic health. How can any societal benefits be sustained if the economy is stagnant? It's simply not sustainable.<br><br>First, unions impact competitiveness and productivity. Unions increase business costs, reducing competitiveness and stifling innovation. Union wage demands redistribute existing wealth, diverting funds from company profits that could be reinvested. As *economist Milton Friedman* has noted, such interventions distort market signals and hinder efficient resource allocation. Our opponents haven't demonstrated a causal link between unionization and increased productivity.<br><br>Second, the threat of inflation cannot be ignored. Union-negotiated wage increases often lead to higher prices, eroding purchasing power. *A 2008 study by the Fraser Institute* found a strong correlation between union wage settlements and inflationary pressures . This demonstrates the broader economic impact.<br><br>Finally, over-reliance on union-provided benefits can create dependency and reduce individual initiative. Private sector training programs are more adaptable and responsive to market needs.<br><br>In conclusion, consider this: Can societal benefits flourish without sustained economic growth? The evidence is clear: unions impede GDP growth. For a prosperous future, we must prioritize economic growth over unsustainable promises of societal benefit.
