                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that labor unions are indeed beneficial to economic growth. We define economic growth as a sustained increase in a country's real gross domestic product  over time, typically measured as the percentage change in real GDP. A labor union is defined as an organization of workers formed to promote and protect its members' interests through collective bargaining with employers regarding wages, working conditions, and other terms of employment.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing overall economic prosperity. The side that demonstrates how labor unions contribute to or detract from the overall economic well-being of a nation, considering factors such as GDP growth, income equality, worker productivity, and innovation, should be favored.<br><br>First, labor unions reduce income inequality, fueling economic growth. Labor unions are proven to raise wages for their members. Studies show union members earn 10.2% more on average than nonunion workers who have comparable jobs and comparable experience . Furthermore, unions improve benefits, including retirement plans, paid vacation, and paid sick leave. By increasing wages and improving benefits for workers, unions reduce the gap between the highest and lowest earners. This increased disposable income for a larger portion of the population leads to greater consumer spending, stimulating demand, and boosting economic activity. The Treasury Department finds that unions spur the economy by reducing income inequality . This reduction in inequality reverses decades of damage and can support economic growth . Therefore, by decreasing income inequality, labor unions empower the middle class, which in turn drives economic growth.<br><br>Second, labor unions enhance worker productivity and innovation. Unions improve workplace environments and engagement with management . By providing a collective voice and improving working conditions, unions empower workers to contribute to workplace improvements and innovation. For example, unions give experienced workers more of a voice in management decisions . This ultimately leads to more efficient processes and higher quality goods and services, boosting overall productivity. Studies show that the effects of unions are particularly strong among manufacturing firms . Therefore, labor unions allow for increased productivity and innovation.<br><br>Third, labor unions promote economic stability and resilience. Unions advocate for policies that support workers and the middle class, such as unemployment insurance and fair labor standards. These policies create a more stable economic environment, reducing the risk of economic downturns and promoting long-term growth. For example, unions increase political participation, particularly voter turnout, in democracies . Additionally, research from the American Progress shows that union households hold significantly more wealth. Union households hold $338,482 in median wealth while nonunion households hold $199,948 . Thus, the advocacy and stability created by labor unions leads to economic resilience.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions are beneficial to economic growth because they reduce income inequality, enhance worker productivity and innovation, and promote economic stability and resilience. For these reasons, we affirm the resolution.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We're here today to debate whether labor unions are beneficial to economic growth, and we firmly stand against that proposition. While we acknowledge the definitions presented, it's vital to focus on the tangible economic consequences of labor unions. We agree that overall economic prosperity is the key judging criterion. However, we define prosperity not merely as a rising GDP, but as encompassing sustainable growth, efficient resource allocation, and a vibrant private sector that benefits everyone.<br><br>Our opposition to labor unions rests on three core arguments. First, union wage premiums create distortions in labor markets. Unions, through collective bargaining, artificially inflate wages for their members. This inflation isn't tied to market value or individual productivity; instead, it's based on the power of the union. This creates a divided system where union workers often earn significantly more than their non-union counterparts for comparable work. According to *an analysis by the U.S. Department of the Treasury, which has conducted extensive research on labor markets*, this union wage premium typically ranges from 10 to 15 percent . This leads to increased costs for businesses, diminishing their competitiveness. Furthermore, it impedes the efficient allocation of labor, as skilled workers might be drawn to union jobs even if their skills could be more productively utilized elsewhere. This ultimately stifles innovation and hinders overall economic dynamism.<br><br>Second, strikes and other union-related disruptions inflict significant harm on economic activity. When unions resort to strikes, the flow of goods and services is disrupted. This results in lost production, decreased sales, and reduced investment. These disruptions not only harm businesses but also undermine investor confidence, leading to long-term economic damage. As *reported by Fool Wealth in 2022, a business and investment trend analysis group*, the market value of affected businesses can decrease by 10 to 14% following a union win . Imagine the impact of a major strike in critical sectors like transportation or manufacturing; the ripple effects can be felt throughout the entire economy.<br><br>Third, unionization within the public sector can lead to unsustainable government spending and increased taxes. Public sector unions frequently negotiate exceptionally generous contracts, including high salaries, extensive benefits, and near-guaranteed job security. These contracts can strain government budgets, forcing taxpayers to bear the burden. We acknowledge that unions can raise wages for their members, which *appears* to reduce income inequality, this often happens at the expense of lower wages and fewer opportunities for non-union workers, creating a different kind of inequality. Furthermore, unions' focus on wage increases overlooks the crucial role of productivity gains in sustainable economic growth, incentivizing what economists call 'rent-seeking behavior,' where unions focus on extracting higher wages regardless of productivity gains, rather than creating more value for the company and the economy. By embracing policies that promote competition, reward innovation, and allow labor markets to function freely, we can unlock a more prosperous and equitable future for all. Therefore, we maintain that labor unions, on balance, are detrimental to economic growth.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four key flaws, concerning definitions, labor market distortions, economic harm from strikes, and public sector union impacts.<br><br>First, the opposition attempts to redefine economic growth beyond the standard measure of GDP, emphasizing "sustainable growth, efficient resource allocation, and a vibrant private sector," but this deviates from established economic principles. Textbooks and economists widely accept GDP as a primary indicator of economic health . Furthermore, these additional factors they mention are not mutually exclusive from unions and in fact can be *caused* by the benefits unions provide.<br><br>Second, they claim union wage premiums distort labor markets, creating artificial inflation, but they fail to acknowledge the distortions caused by excessive executive compensation. The Economic Policy Institute reports that CEO compensation has grown exponentially, far outpacing worker wage growth, which creates income inequality and market instability . Much of executive pay is tied to short-term stock prices and not long term sustainability. Additionally, the Treasury Department supports the idea that unions can increase economy-wide growth and resilience . Therefore, let's address all sources of market distortion, not just those affecting workers.<br><br>Third, the negative team exaggerates the economic harm caused by strikes, citing a "Fool Wealth" report, but this source lacks the credibility and rigor of academic studies. Strikes are often a symptom of underlying economic inequalities and unfair labor practices, not the root cause of economic problems. Furthermore, the Economic Policy Institute shows that business decisions like layoffs and plant closures cause more significant and lasting economic disruptions . Thus, focusing solely on strikes ignores the broader context of economic instability.<br><br>Fourth, they argue that public sector unions lead to unsustainable government spending, relying on ideologically driven sources like the Cato Institute, but they ignore the essential services these unions provide. Public sector unions ensure quality education, healthcare, and infrastructure, which are crucial for long-term economic growth. A study by the Center for Economic and Policy Research found that unionized public sectors are often more efficient and less prone to corruption than non-unionized sectors . Therefore, the value of these services outweighs the perceived costs.<br><br>In conclusion, we stand firm that labor unions are beneficial for economic growth, and we urge you to affirm the resolution.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate the opportunity to clarify our position. However, there are critical flaws in the arguments presented. We will address four key areas: the definitions of economic growth and labor unions, the impact on income inequality, the effect on worker productivity, and the role of public sector unions. As you'll see, their perspective oversimplifies complex economic realities and overlooks key economic principles.<br><br>First, let's address definitions. The opposition narrowly defines economic growth solely as an increase in GDP. But is that a comprehensive view? True economic prosperity includes *sustainable* growth, efficient resource allocation, and a thriving private sector that benefits everyone. While it's true that labor unions may advocate for worker interests, defining them merely as protectors of worker interests ignores potential downsides like market distortions and reduced competitiveness. It's like focusing only on the immediate comfort of a bandage while ignoring the underlying infection.<br><br>Second, regarding income inequality, the opposition claims unions reduce it. But do they truly foster widespread economic equality? Union wage increases, often disconnected from productivity, distort market signals, benefiting union members at the expense of others. According to *IZA World of Labor*, which provides expert analysis on labor market issues, union-negotiated wage increases can negatively impact firms without "excess" profits, reducing their ability to invest and create jobs. Consider this: is it fair to inflate wages for some through collective bargaining while potentially limiting opportunities and depressing wages for non-union workers? That's not economic growth for all; it's a redistribution of wealth that can stifle overall economic expansion.<br><br>Third, the opposition asserts that unions boost worker productivity. However, this is not always the case, and in some instances, unions can hinder productivity. Sometimes, union rules and rigid contracts stifle innovation and flexibility, preventing companies from adapting to changing market conditions. As *Payscale*, a compensation data and software company, notes, the time spent on union negotiations can adversely affect productivity. Moreover, union contracts in the public sector can make it difficult to terminate underperforming employees, as highlighted by *FedSmith*, a news site for federal employees. It's like a gardener so focused on weeding according to a strict schedule that they forget to water the plants when they need it most. The crucial issue here is whether unions truly foster an environment of innovation and efficiency, or whether they create rigid structures that impede progress.<br><br>Finally, let's examine the public sector. The opposition claims public sector unions provide essential services that outweigh the costs. While quality education and healthcare are vital, unsustainable spending and increased taxes are still harmful to economic growth. As we have discussed, generous union contracts strain government budgets. Furthermore, the *Institute for Government* points out the difficulty in accurately measuring productivity gains in the public sector, making it challenging to assess the true value of these services. The question is: at what cost do we provide these services? A balanced approach is needed, not blind acceptance of union demands that can lead to long-term fiscal instability. The ratchet effect, where union gains are locked in regardless of economic conditions, further exacerbates this problem.<br><br>Therefore, we believe the evidence clearly demonstrates that labor unions are not always beneficial to economic growth and can, in many cases, be detrimental. We urge you to oppose the resolution.<br><br></div>

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the definition of economic growth. The impact of labor unions on income inequality worker productivity and the role of public sector unions. Regarding the definition of economic growth the opposition argues for a broad definition beyond gdp. Encompassing sustainability and resource allocation. However while these factors are important. Gdp remains the most widely accepted and practical measure. Furthermore unions contribute to a more robust private sector by reducing inequality as supported by the treasury department. These factors are not mutually exclusive as we previously mentioned. Unsustainable practices will eventually hurt gdp while unions by reducing inequality lead to a more robust private sector. On income inequality the opposition claims unions simply redistribute wealth unfairly. However union wage increases stimulate the economy by increasing spending thereby growing the economic pi as noted by the treasury department. Furthermore they focus exclusively on union distortions. While ignoring other much larger distort. Such as executive compensation. Which contributes far more to income inequality? The economic policy institute indicates that ceo compensation has grown exponentially. Far outpacing worker wage growth. The negative has also failed to prove that wage increases are disconnected from productivity. Concerning worker productivity. We maintain that unions enhance productivity by providing workers with job security. Encouraging investment in skills and training. Unions can spur overall economic productivity by improving working environments and giving experienced workers more of a voice in management decisions. The opposition sources lack the credibility of academic studies. And they failed to provide examples of unions decreasing productivity. Finally regarding public sector unions.<br><br>

The opposition views unions as economic liabilities, emphasizing wage premiums and market distortions. However, this perspective overlooks unions' significant contributions to a thriving economy. We've demonstrated that unions are vital for economic growth by reducing inequality and boosting productivity.<br><br>First, regarding wage concerns, the opposition suggests union wages are disconnected from productivity, leading to market distortions. However, unions drive workplace improvements, fostering efficiency and quality. Executive compensation also contributes to labor market distortions.<br><br>Second, unions empower workers, fostering a more stable and equitable economic landscape. By providing workers a collective voice, unions ensure better working conditions, training, and job satisfaction. This empowerment translates to increased productivity and innovation, directly benefiting economic growth.<br><br>Third, concerning the opposition's concerns about strikes, strikes are not the cause of economic problems, but a symptom of underlying issues. Suppressing workers' rights has far-reaching consequences that outweigh the disruptions caused by occasional strikes.<br><br>In conclusion, the question is: do we prioritize short-term gains for a few, or long-term prosperity for many? The evidence demonstrates that unions play a crucial role in fostering economic growth by reducing inequality, boosting productivity, and empowering workers. We urge you to affirm that labor unions are beneficial to economic growth. Thank you.
