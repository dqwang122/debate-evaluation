                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss the vital role labor unions play in fostering economic growth. Let's begin with a clear definition: labor unions are organizations of workers formed to protect and advance their collective interests through bargaining with employers.<br><br>To properly evaluate this debate, we propose judging the impact of labor unions based on three core pillars of a thriving economy: equitable wealth distribution, workforce stability, and innovation. We will demonstrate how unions are undeniably beneficial across these metrics.<br><br>First, labor unions demonstrably reduce income inequality, leading to a more equitable distribution of wealth and a healthier economy. Unions achieve this by securing better wages and benefits for workers. According to the Economic Policy Institute, workers covered by a union contract earn, on average, 10.2% more in wages than their nonunion counterparts with similar education, occupation, and experience [1]. This "union wage premium" directly addresses income disparities. Consider that, as revealed in a fact sheet by the Program on Race, Ethnicity and the Economy, income inequality was at its lowest point following World War II, coinciding with peak union membership in 1945 [2]. As union strength declined after 1979, income inequality worsened, reaching levels not seen since the Great Depression [2]. By narrowing the gap between high and low earners, unions promote social stability and increase the spending power of lower-income individuals, further driving economic growth as measured by GDP growth and consumer spending. It's a simple concept: when more people have more money, they spend more, stimulating the economy.<br><br>Second, unions are instrumental in creating a stable and productive workforce. They achieve this through comprehensive, union-negotiated benefits packages, including healthcare and retirement plans, which attract and retain skilled workers. In fact, over 90% of unionized workers have access to employer-sponsored health benefits, compared to just 68% of nonunion workers [3]. This difference is significant. Moreover, unions reduce employee turnover by increasing job satisfaction and insulating workers from retaliation when communicating discontent [4]. *WorkRise Network* indicates that unionized workers are less likely to leave their jobs, fostering stability crucial for investments in firm-specific human capital and training [4]. Consider the impact of union apprenticeship programs. A report indicates that apprentices are more likely to complete union programs with a 42% completion rate versus 22% for nonunion apprentices [5]. This stability translates directly into increased productivity and allows companies to plan for the future with confidence.<br><br>Finally, labor unions foster a culture of innovation by encouraging workers to share their ideas for improving products, processes, and services, leading to increased competitiveness and economic growth. By creating a safe and supportive environment for workers to express their ideas, unions help to unlock the collective intelligence of the workforce and drive innovation within organizations. While some might argue that unions can hinder business efficiency, the evidence suggests that the benefits of increased worker morale, stability, and innovation often outweigh these potential costs.<br><br>In conclusion, by promoting fair wages, securing comprehensive benefits, and fostering innovation, labor unions are a powerful engine for economic growth. We firmly believe that supporting labor unions is supporting a stronger and more prosperous economy for all.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Banerjee, Asha, Margaret Poydock, Celine McNicholas, Ihna Mangundayao, and Ali Sait.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that labor unions are beneficial to economic growth. We define "economic growth" as a sustained increase in a country's real gross domestic product (GDP) over a period of time, typically measured annually, reflecting an increase in the production of goods and services [13]. We define "labor unions" as organizations of workers formed to promote and protect their members' interests through collective bargaining with employers regarding wages, benefits, and working conditions [2]. Our judging criteria is maximizing long-term economic productivity; the side that demonstrates policies which lead to the greatest sustainable increase in a nation's overall productivity and prosperity should win the debate.<br><br>First, labor unions reduce income inequality, stimulating demand and economic growth. Higher union density correlates with lower income inequality and stronger economic growth [1]. Unions promote fair wages and social policies, directly combating the harmful effects of inequality on economic expansion [1]. Studies show that sectoral bargaining, often facilitated by unions, is particularly effective at closing pay gaps [3]. By increasing wages for workers, unions boost consumer spending, enhancing overall consumer spending and stimulating economic growth [4]. The increased purchasing power among union members fuels demand, leading to a more robust economy [4]. Therefore, labor unions play a crucial role in fostering economic growth by mitigating income inequality and boosting consumer demand.<br><br>Second, labor unions increase worker productivity through collective bargaining and improved working conditions. Unionization enhances employee satisfaction and productivity through improved workplace policies and collaboration [5, 6]. When organizations engage in meaningful discussions with unions, policies that ensure employee satisfaction and safety often exceed regulatory standards [5]. The collaborative dynamic fostered by unions enhances trust and improves morale, creating a more harmonious work environment [5]. This encourages employer-union collaboration, leading to higher employee satisfaction and productivity, making it a win-win for both employers and employees [5]. By improving workplace environments and fostering collaboration, labor unions drive productivity gains that contribute to overall economic growth.<br><br>Third, labor unions limit corporate risk-taking, promoting financial stability conducive to long-term economic growth. Labor unions can limit corporate risk-taking to protect their interests [9, 10]. Research indicates that unionization is associated with less risk-taking in corporate investments [7]. By advocating for their members' interests, unions encourage more stable and sustainable corporate strategies, which in turn reduces the likelihood of financial crises [9, 10]. This stability fosters a more predictable economic environment, encouraging long-term investment and growth. Therefore, unions indirectly contribute to economic growth by promoting corporate financial responsibility and stability.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions are beneficial to economic growth. They reduce income inequality, increase worker productivity, and limit corporate risk-taking, all of which contribute to a more stable and prosperous economy. For these reasons, we affirm the motion.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) PMC, Higher union density correlates with lower income inequality and stronger economic growth.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">While our opponents paint a favorable picture of labor unions as drivers of economic growth, we contend that their arguments overlook critical factors, demonstrating the opposite. The motion before us is that labor unions are beneficial to economic growth, and we stand firmly opposed.<br><br>Let's first address their definitions and judging criteria. While we acknowledge that economic growth includes an increase in GDP – which simply means the total value of goods and services produced in a country – limiting the definition to this metric alone neglects crucial elements like environmental sustainability and social well-being. Moreover, maximizing long-term economic productivity must also consider adaptability and innovation, areas where union rigidity can be a hindrance, not a help.<br><br>Our opponents claim that unions reduce income inequality, but this assertion is a gross oversimplification. In reality, union wage premiums often create disparities between unionized and non-unionized workers, negatively impacting overall market efficiency. The argument that increased spending power of union members necessarily 'drives economic growth' is based on a flawed understanding of economic principles and ignores the detrimental effects of union wage hikes. What benefits a specific sector can harm the wider economy – the fallacy of composition. Imagine a local bakery forced to raise prices because of union wage demands, potentially losing customers to cheaper, non-union competitors.<br><br>They further argue that unions increase worker productivity, but the resulting higher labor costs can reduce a company's ability to invest in innovation and expansion, ultimately offsetting any productivity gains. In fact, research from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley shows that passing a union election results in an 8.7% decline in patent quantity, demonstrating a clear reduction in innovation [1]. Lastly, while unions may limit corporate risk-taking, excessive caution can stifle innovation and prevent companies from pursuing potentially high-growth opportunities, ultimately hindering long-term economic expansion.<br><br>Now, let's turn to the core of our opposition. First, union-negotiated wage increases, detached from individual productivity, inflate labor costs, diminishing overall economic competitiveness. According to the Economic Policy Institute, major strike activity increased by 280% in 2023 [2]. Artificially elevated wages, driven by collective bargaining rather than individual output, can price businesses out of the market, leading to reduced hiring and slower economic expansion. This undermines the argument that unions contribute to economic growth.<br><br>Second, union work rules and rigid job classifications stifle innovation and operational efficiency, hindering a business's ability to adapt to market changes. Such rules prevent employers from adapting quickly to changing market conditions and adopting innovative technologies, ultimately reducing efficiency and flexibility.<br><br>Third, union-driven strikes and work stoppages disrupt supply chains and economic activity, leading to significant financial losses. For example, the United Auto Workers strike against General Motors in 2019 cost the automaker approximately $4 billion [3]. These disruptions can cause ripple effects throughout the economy, impacting businesses, consumers, and overall economic stability.<br><br>For these reasons, we firmly oppose the motion, asserting that labor unions are, in fact, detrimental to economic growth.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Our opponents argue that labor unions hinder economic growth, but their claims crumble under scrutiny when examined against established economic principles and empirical evidence.<br><br>First, let's dismantle their argument concerning wages and prices. They assert that union-negotiated wage increases artificially inflate labor costs, thereby diminishing competitiveness. This argument rests on the shaky foundation that wage increases are somehow divorced from productivity gains, a notion that is demonstrably false. According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, simple comparisons show that union workers typically make about 20 percent more than nonunion workers [1]. This "union wage premium" reflects the fact that unions improve both fringe benefits and non-wage features of the workplace [1]. Moreover, the Economic Policy Institute reported in 2003 that unions have a positive impact on the wages of nonunion workers in industries and markets where unions have a strong presence [2]. This demonstrates that the benefits of unionization extend beyond union members themselves.<br><br>The claim that union wage gains come at the expense of non-union workers is a straw man fallacy. It misrepresents our argument. We are not claiming that unions *necessarily* harm non-union workers. Rather, we contend that the overall effect is positive due to increased economic activity and potential spillover effects. Higher wages translate directly into increased consumer spending, which in turn fuels demand and stimulates economic activity. As unions improve wages, they put pressure on other employers to increase wages too. It's like a rising tide lifting all boats.<br><br>Second, let's address the issue of unions and innovation. Our opponents suggest that union work rules and rigid job classifications stifle innovation. This argument erroneously assumes a fixed pool of capital, ignoring the stimulus to aggregate demand from higher wages that fuels economic expansion. Innovation isn't solely about patents; it encompasses workplace safety and worker satisfaction. Furthermore, this argument commits the fallacy of reversing cause and effect, suggesting that a decrease in patent quantity after unionization necessarily indicates a lack of innovation. It overlooks the possibility that unionization may lead to a greater focus on worker safety and well-being, which are also crucial aspects of economic progress. In fact, unions may reduce turnover by increasing job satisfaction [3]. This effect is reinforced by the ability of unions to mitigate job losses during downturns, avoiding the negative consequences of unemployment on workers’ well-being [3].<br><br>Third, regarding the broader economic effects of union activity, our opponents highlight the disruption caused by union-driven strikes, arguing that these lead to financial losses. However, they fail to consider the crucial role of strikes in correcting systemic imbalances. These actions, while sometimes disruptive in the short term, are essential for ensuring fair labor practices, adequate worker safety, and equitable distribution of economic gains. Moreover, unions spur the economy by reducing income inequality [4]. Inequality harms overall economic growth by putting more money into the hands of the very wealthy, who tend to save that money, and less money into the hands of lower-income and middle-income people, who are very likely to spend it—and thus spur the economy—by buying cars, fuel, washing machines, furniture, baby strollers, food, clothing, and other necessities [4].<br><br>Finally, our definition of economic growth as a sustained increase in real GDP provides a clear and measurable metric for evaluating the impact of labor unions.<br><br>For these reasons, we firmly maintain that labor unions are indeed beneficial to economic growth.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Labor Unions and the U.S. Economy | U.S. Department of the Treasury.<br>[2] Walters, Matthew and Lawrence Mishel.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, which are: a mischaracterization of economic growth, an overestimation of negative impacts of labor unions on innovation, and a misunderstanding of the role of strikes.<br><br>First, the opposition claims that our definition of economic growth, focused on GDP, is too narrow and neglects sustainability and social well-being. While sustainability and social well-being are undeniably important, they are distinct from the core measure of economic growth. GDP remains the universally accepted primary metric [13]. Economic textbooks, the World Bank, and the IMF all rely on GDP as the fundamental indicator of economic expansion.<br><br>Second, they argue that union wage premiums create disparities and harm market efficiency, while studies show that union wage premiums reflect productivity gains or firm capacity to pay more. It's important to consider the disparities created by executive compensation, which dwarfs worker wages. Also, the idea that union wages *necessarily* harm market efficiency is a fallacy of composition -- what *can* happen doesn't mean it *will* happen. The Treasury Department has found that unions contribute to overall economic growth and resilience [1].<br><br>Third, the opposition cites a single study to claim unions reduce innovation. This is not conclusive evidence. Multiple studies indicate that unions can be a collective voice, boosting labor productivity and, by extension, innovation [2, 3]. Furthermore, increased wages can incentivize innovation, as companies seek ways to improve efficiency.<br><br>Fourth, our opponents suggest that unions' caution stifles innovation by preventing companies from pursuing potentially high-growth opportunities. We argue that unions encourage *responsible* risk-taking. Recent research shows that unions can improve overall financial stability by encouraging firms to make less risky borrowing decisions [1]. This stability fosters a more predictable economic environment, encouraging long-term investment and growth.<br><br>Fifth, they claim union-negotiated wages inflate labor costs and diminish economic competitiveness, however, sectoral bargaining reduces anti-union sentiment which incentivizes business growth and productivity [3]. The opposition fails to acknowledge that higher wages boost consumer spending, stimulating demand and offsetting increased labor costs. As Sodaless Solutions has stated, unions lead to higher wages which improves purchasing power, stimulating economic growth [4]. This collaborative dynamic enhances trust and improves morale, creating a more harmonious work environment [5].<br><br>Finally, the opposition points to strikes as disruptive. Strikes are a necessary tool for workers to advocate for fair wages and working conditions, which ultimately contribute to long-term economic well-being.<br><br>For these reasons, we maintain that labor unions are beneficial to economic growth.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) U.S. Department of the Treasury, Labor Unions and the U.S. Economy, 2023.<br>(2) Philip Rossen, The Power of Collective Bargaining, 2023.<br>(3) Fordham ILJ, Comparing Labor Relations: How Models of Unionization Differ Between the US and Europe, 2024.<br>(4) Sodaless Solutions, Navigating Unionization: Challenges, Opportunities, and Strategies for Success, 2024.<br>(5) Sodaless Solutions, Unionization can enhance employee satisfaction and productivity through improved workplace policies and collaboration, 2024.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Our opponents attempt to paint a rosy picture of unions, but their arguments crumble under scrutiny. They claim our focus on GDP is too narrow, but let's be clear: While GDP doesn't capture everything, it is the bedrock upon which economic discussions are built. To ignore it is like building a house on sand. It is the agreed metric in economic textbooks by the World Bank and IMF. They can't just redefine well established principles. To imply it's insufficient is not true, but rather a straw man that they built up.<br><br>They try to defend union wage premiums as reflections of productivity, but this ignores the reality that these wages are often driven by collective bargaining power, not economic factors. This is a fallacy of composition – what benefits union members doesn’t automatically benefit the entire economy. Higher union wages, even when tied to increased productivity, can lead to inflated prices for goods and services. This in turn harms non-unionized workers and consumers, especially small business owners who are already struggling with inflation.<br><br>Not only do union wage premiums harm consumers, but they also stifle innovation and economic growth. Their claim that sectoral bargaining reduces anti-union sentiment is simply not true. In fact, it can increase resentment among non-union workers and businesses when they see unionized sectors gaining advantages at their expense. Unionization doesn't lead to streamlined production as our opponents claim. Union’s standardized work rules prevent employers from adopting quickly to changing market conditions and adopting innovative technologies. According to *a report by The Heritage Foundation in 2009*, unionized employers must pay thousands of dollars in attorney's fees and spend months negotiating before making any changes in the workplace [6]. This inflexibility makes unionized businesses less competitive.<br><br>What about their claim that unions are boosting labor productivity? Consider this: passing a union election results in a decline in patent quantity, demonstrating a reduction in innovation.<br><br>Moreover, they claim unions encourage responsible risk-taking but this caution can stifle innovation, preventing companies from pursuing potentially high-growth opportunities. For example, unions wanting worker benefits might avoid new risky ventures, preventing new technology.<br><br>Their final defense of strikes as a necessary tool rings hollow. While strikes might be "necessary" in some cases, they inflict immediate economic damage, disrupting supply chains and harming consumers. *The U.S. Chamber of Commerce* reported in 2025 the impact of strikes manifests itself in various forms, ranging from decreasing productivity due to the temporary halt in operations to severe strains on supply chains. For workers, strikes can often lead to reduced income and the curtailment —or sometimes—the elimination of their benefits. According to *AAF's report in September 2024*, the United Auto Workers strike, which began in September 2023 and lasted six weeks, heavily contributed to increased strike activity and idleness that year. With about 50,000 participating workers, it is estimated to have cost Ford, GM, and Stellantis a total of $3.6 billion in lost revenue.<br><br>In closing, our opponents fail to grasp that their arguments oversimplify a complex issue. We do not claim that unions are inherently evil. But the benefits they tout are frequently overstated. The short-term benefit they provide does not account for the long-term devastation to economic growth.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[6] Sherk, James.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttals fail to address the core issues we raised. They attempt to redefine economic growth, misrepresent the impact of unions on innovation, and downplay the disruptive nature of strikes.<br><br>First, they claim GDP is the universally accepted measure of economic growth [13]. However, this ignores the growing consensus that GDP alone is insufficient. Organizations like the UN advocate for the Human Development Index, incorporating health, education, and living standards [1]. Economists increasingly recognize the Genuine Progress Indicator as a more comprehensive measure [2]. While GDP is important, true economic growth must also consider sustainability and social well-being, aspects demonstrably hindered by union practices.<br><br>Second, they argue union wage premiums reflect productivity gains. But studies show that union wage increases often outpace productivity, leading to inflated costs [3]. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that unions raise wages by approximately 10-20% but do not necessarily increase productivity at the same rate [4]. This artificial inflation prices businesses out of the market and harms consumers through higher prices. While increased spending power *can* stimulate the economy, it also prices goods out of reach for lower-income individuals, negating any positive effect.<br><br>Third, they dismiss our evidence on unions stifling innovation as a single study. We will reiterate that research from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley shows that passing a union election results in an 8.7% decline in patent quantity [5]. Where is their comparable evidence showing unions *boost* innovation? The affirmative’s claims rely on anecdotal evidence, not rigorous studies.<br><br>Fourth, they assert that unions encourage "responsible" risk-taking. What does that even mean? Union caution often translates to resistance to technological advancements and efficiency improvements that are vital for long-term growth. For example, union opposition to automation in manufacturing has delayed the adoption of productivity-enhancing technologies [6]. This excessive caution prevents companies from pursuing potentially high-growth opportunities.<br><br>Fifth, they argue that sectoral bargaining boosts productivity. Where is the concrete evidence that sectoral bargaining has *long-term* productivity gains? Sectoral bargaining can create labor monopolies, stifling competition and innovation. The Economic Policy Institute notes that while sectoral bargaining may reduce anti-union sentiment, it can lead to higher prices and reduced consumer choice [7].<br><br>Finally, while they claim strikes are a necessary tool, they conveniently ignore the immense economic damage they cause. The 2019 United Auto Workers strike against General Motors cost the automaker approximately $4 billion [8]. These disruptions ripple through the economy, impacting businesses, consumers, and overall stability. There are less disruptive means of dispute resolution, such as mediation and arbitration, that should be prioritized.<br><br>For these reasons, we stand firm that labor unions are detrimental to economic growth.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) United Nations Development Programme.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, we've demonstrated that labor unions are, without question, beneficial to economic growth. The opposition tried to muddy the waters by suggesting GDP isn't the primary measure, but as we've shown, GDP remains the universally accepted standard, used by institutions like the World Bank and IMF. To dismiss GDP is to ignore the economic reality.<br><br>The central point of contention is unions' impact on innovation and productivity. The opposition clung to one study claiming unions stifle innovation. We, however, presented compelling evidence that unions enhance productivity. Consider this: collective bargaining, as documented by *Harvard Law School's Labor and Worklife Program*, gives workers a voice, leading to improved working conditions and financial stability [1]. This translates directly into a more motivated and productive workforce.<br><br>Furthermore, the opposition painted strikes as purely detrimental. We acknowledge strikes can cause short-term disruptions. However, they are a crucial tool of last resort. As *research from the Economic Policy Institute in 2024* indicates, the alternative is unchecked corporate power, leading to suppressed wages and increased inequality [2]. Imagine a scenario where workers are exploited, with stagnant wages that barely cover basic needs. Without the power to strike, they are left with no recourse. These short-term costs are a necessary investment in long-term economic health.<br><br>In conclusion, unions are not a hindrance, but a vital component of a thriving economy. They foster a more equitable distribution of wealth, drive productivity through improved worker conditions, and ensure corporations are held accountable. For sustainable and inclusive economic growth, we must support labor unions.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the fundamental role of labor unions in fostering economic growth.<br><br>Our opponents attempted to redefine "economic growth" to fit their narrative, but we firmly established that GDP remains the universally accepted primary metric [1]. We demonstrated that union wages reflect increased productivity, boosting consumer spending and stimulating demand, which offsets labor costs [2]. Even the Treasury Department acknowledges unions' contribution to economic resilience [3].<br><br>The claim that unions stifle innovation is based on limited evidence. Unions foster collaboration and improve working conditions, incentivizing innovation [4]. Moreover, unions encourage responsible risk-taking, promoting long-term financial stability [5]. Strikes, though potentially disruptive, are a necessary mechanism for correcting power imbalances and ensuring worker well-being.<br><br>We believe that unions promote economic well-being for all by reducing inequality, increasing productivity, and fostering corporate responsibility [6]. By empowering workers and promoting fair wages, unions create a more just and prosperous society for everyone.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Investopedia<br>(2) Sodaless Solutions, 2024<br>(3) U.S. Department of the Treasury, 2023<br>(4) Philip Rossen, 2023<br>(5) NYU Stern<br>(6) PMC

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The crux of this debate rests on what we truly value as economic growth. Our opponents narrowly define it by metrics like GDP, while we champion a more holistic view: one that prioritizes innovation, competitiveness, and adaptability as the engines of lasting prosperity.<br><br>The central issue has been the real-world impact of labor unions. We've shown how unionization stifles innovation. According to *research by the American Enterprise Institute*, companies subject to strong union presence are less likely to invest in research and development [1]. This directly impacts consumers, who miss out on innovative products and services. Our opponents propose collaboration, but the evidence points to decreased creativity and adaptability, essential components for long-term economic growth.<br><br>Furthermore, we cannot dismiss the damaging effects of union strikes. While framed as a tool for improving working conditions, strikes inflict significant economic damage. *A 2023 report by the Mackinac Center for Public Policy* found that states with higher unionization rates experience more frequent and prolonged strikes, leading to substantial losses in productivity and revenue [2]. This lost revenue inevitably impacts taxpayers, as governments are forced to intervene with financial aid to struggling businesses. These businesses are then less able to expand and create jobs in local communities.<br><br>Therefore, the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that the costs of unionization outweigh any perceived benefits. We prioritize genuine economic growth and innovation for future generations. We have clearly shown that these critical elements suffer under the constraints imposed by labor unions. We urge you to consider the long-term consequences and reject policies that hinder progress and prosperity.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the definition of economic growth and the impact of labor unions on innovation and overall economic prosperity.<br><br>Let's begin with the very foundation of this debate: the definition of economic growth. While GDP is undeniably a component, it's insufficient in isolation. We must consider the broader picture – a picture that includes environmental responsibility, social equity, and, crucially, a climate that fosters innovation and adaptability. The Easterlin Paradox clearly indicates this shortsightedness. We must ask ourselves, what benefits union members cannot benefit the entire economy.<br><br>This brings us to the core of our disagreement: the impact of unions on innovation. Our opponents claim unions can boost innovation, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Research from the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley shows that passing a union election results in an 8.7% decline in patent quantity [1]. The Heritage Foundation report highlights the thousands of dollars in attorney fees spent negotiating changes in union workplaces. The increased prices for goods and services harm consumers, especially small business owners already struggling with inflation. Ultimately, businesses will move somewhere with cheaper labor, to innovate the same services somewhere else.<br><br>Our opponents champion union wage premiums as reflections of productivity, but these wages are often driven by collective bargaining power, not economic factors. This creates disparities and reduces a company's ability to invest in research and development or expand its operations. Strikes can deter businesses from investing in a region, leading to long-term economic stagnation.<br><br>Our opponents offer a vision of short-term gains for a select group of workers. We offer a vision of long-term economic prosperity for all.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Bradley, Daniel, Incheol Kim, and Xuan Tian.
