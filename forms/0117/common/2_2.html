                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue.  This means that student-athletes, particularly in revenue-generating sports, should receive direct financial compensation beyond scholarships, stipends, and cost of attendance, derived from the revenue their athletic participation generates. This includes, but is not limited to, revenue sharing, appearance fees, and performance bonuses.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing student-athlete welfare. This framework prioritizes the overall well-being of student-athletes, encompassing their financial security, educational opportunities, and physical and mental health. This is appropriate because the core purpose of collegiate athletics should be to benefit the students involved, not solely the institutions.<br><br>First, profit-sharing fairly compensates student-athletes for their labor and contribution to revenue generation.  Student-athletes, particularly in high-revenue sports like football and basketball, generate substantial income for their institutions through ticket sales, merchandise, and lucrative media deals.  For example, the NCAA's March Madness basketball tournament generates almost $1 billion in revenue annually . These athletes dedicate significant time and effort, often exceeding 40 hours per week , at the expense of other academic or personal pursuits, making their athletic participation akin to a full-time job.  Profit-sharing acknowledges their substantial contribution to this revenue stream and provides fair compensation for their labor, much like revenue-sharing models in professional sports leagues like the NFL and NBA which distribute a percentage of league revenue to the players .  Therefore, implementing profit-sharing in college sports recognizes the economic realities of these athletes' contributions and compensates them accordingly.<br><br>Second, profit-sharing promotes financial stability and reduces financial stress for student-athletes.  Research indicates that many student-athletes, even those on scholarship, struggle financially . A survey found that 60% of college athletes reported concerns about daily expenses . Profit-sharing can alleviate these financial burdens, allowing them to focus on their academics and athletic performance without the added stress of financial insecurity. Stories of athletes benefiting from NIL deals further highlight this potential - for instance, one athlete used NIL earnings to support his family after his father lost his job . By improving financial well-being, institutions can facilitate a better learning environment by reducing financial-related stress, theoretically allowing students to focus more on academics. Thus, distributing a portion of sports revenue directly benefits athletes, allowing them to fully engage in their educational experience.<br><br>Third, profit-sharing enhances the educational experience and aligns with the values of collegiate athletics. By reducing financial burdens and providing fair compensation, profit-sharing enables student-athletes to fully engage in their educational experience.  It can also promote a sense of professionalism and responsibility, teaching valuable financial management skills that will benefit them beyond their collegiate careers.  Programs teaching financial literacy have been shown to improve financial outcomes for participants .  This ultimately strengthens the educational mission of universities and aligns with the ideal of supporting student-athletes holistically. Just as professional athletes benefit from financial management training , so too would student athletes learn valuable financial skills. Therefore, sharing profits not only rewards their labor but prepares them for life after college.<br><br>In conclusion, implementing profit-sharing in college sports is a crucial step towards ensuring fair compensation, promoting financial stability, and enhancing the overall educational experience for student-athletes.  It recognizes their significant contributions, addresses the economic realities of college sports, and ultimately aligns with the core values of higher education.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1)  NCAA.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that student-athletes should *not* receive profits from college sports revenue.  This means we oppose any system where student-athletes are directly compensated beyond their existing scholarships and benefits for their athletic participation.<br>Our judging criteria is the preservation of the collegiate model, which prioritizes the student-athlete's academic pursuits and the overall educational mission of the university.  Any system of compensation should be evaluated based on its impact on this core principle.<br><br>First, paying student-athletes undermines the amateur ideal of college sports.  The collegiate model is built on the foundation of amateurism, where student-athletes participate primarily for the love of the sport and the pursuit of education. Introducing financial incentives shifts this dynamic and creates a more professionalized environment, potentially detracting from the educational mission. Studies examining the history of amateurism in sport, such as , demonstrate how the shift towards professionalism can often lead to a decline in the intrinsic motivation and educational focus of participants.<br><br>Second, financial aid already provides substantial compensation for student-athletes.  Many student-athletes receive scholarships covering tuition, fees, room, and board, representing a substantial financial investment by universities .  Adding salaries to this existing compensation creates a system of double payment, which is inequitable compared to the vast majority of students who receive no financial aid.  Furthermore, research like  demonstrates that the current distribution of athletic scholarships already heavily favors revenue-generating sports, creating disparities within athletic departments.  Direct compensation would likely exacerbate this issue, further disadvantaging athletes in non-revenue sports.<br><br>Third, paying student-athletes creates an uneven playing field and exacerbates existing inequalities.  Wealthier universities with larger athletic budgets would inevitably offer higher salaries, creating an even greater competitive imbalance.  This would essentially turn college sports into a bidding war, where success is determined by financial power rather than athletic talent or coaching ability . Such a system undermines the principles of fair competition and further concentrates resources among a select few elite programs.  Studies like  have shown the detrimental impact of financial disparities on competitive balance in professional sports, highlighting the potential pitfalls of a similar model in college athletics.<br><br>In conclusion, compensating student-athletes beyond their current scholarships and benefits undermines the amateur ideal, creates financial inequities both within and between universities, and ultimately jeopardizes the educational mission of the collegiate model.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) "The Idea of Amateurism: Its Origins and Its Transformations" by Allen Guttmann, *Quest*, Vol. 34, No. 1, 1982.<br>(2) NCAA, "Trends in Student-Athlete Aid," [link needed - please provide official NCAA data link]<br>(3) Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, "A Call to Action: Reclaiming the Educational Primacy of Intercollegiate Athletics," 2020.  <br>(4) Zimbalist, Andrew.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several flaws, specifically their mischaracterization of the collegiate model, underestimation of student-athlete burdens, and exaggeration of potential inequalities.  These flaws prevent them from upholding the true spirit of collegiate athletics, which is maximizing student-athlete welfare, our judging criteria for this debate.<br><br>First, the opponents argue that paying student-athletes undermines the amateur ideal. However, this rests on a false dichotomy.  Amateurism is about the love of the sport, not about precluding fair compensation.  Professional athletes, compensated for their labor, are still driven by passion for their sport. Similarly, compensating student-athletes doesn't diminish their love for the game. In fact, the financial pressures faced by many student-athletes, who dedicate 40+ hours a week to their sport , can force them to take outside jobs, potentially detracting from *both* their athletic and academic pursuits.  By alleviating these financial burdens, we enhance the student aspect of student-athlete, allowing them to focus on their education and their sport.  The emergence of NIL deals demonstrates that student-athletes can successfully balance endorsements with their academic and athletic commitments , further proving that compensation does not inherently erode amateurism.  This directly refutes the opponent's claim and reinforces the idea that financial stability *supports* the collegiate model, not undermines it.<br><br>Second, the opponents claim that financial aid is sufficient compensation. This is simply untrue for a large number of student-athletes. While some athletes receive full scholarships, many do not, and even those who do often struggle with additional expenses like cost of living, medical bills, and family support .  Research indicates that a significant percentage of college athletes express concerns about meeting their daily expenses , demonstrating a clear need for additional financial support.  Their argument of "double payment" is a red herring. These athletes generate enormous revenue for their universities , justifying their share of the profits.  Academic scholarships, like athletic ones, are a form of "payment" for achievement.  Shouldn't athletic excellence be similarly recognized? By addressing the financial struggles faced by student-athletes, we directly improve their overall well-being, a key component of maximizing student-athlete welfare. This dismantles the opponent's argument that current financial aid is sufficient and strengthens our case for profit-sharing.<br><br>Third, the opponents contend that paying athletes creates an uneven playing field, a concern we share. However, disparities *already* exist due to varying resources and facilities.  The current NIL landscape demonstrates that differing levels of compensation are already a reality without destroying college sports . Furthermore, this issue can be mitigated through solutions like salary caps or revenue sharing models, similar to those successfully implemented in professional sports leagues .  Their argument ignores the existing academic disparities between universities based on funding and resources. Should we, by their logic, eliminate academic scholarships because some universities can offer more generous packages?  Clearly not.  By proposing solutions to address potential imbalances, we preemptively address the opponent's concerns and reinforce our commitment to a fair and equitable system that benefits all student-athletes.<br><br>In conclusion, the negative team’s arguments fail to recognize the financial realities and pressures faced by student-athletes. Their narrow interpretation of the collegiate model ignores the crucial role of student-athlete welfare. Our arguments, by advocating for profit-sharing, directly address the financial needs and overall well-being of student-athletes, thereby strengthening and modernizing the true collegiate ideal, not destroying it.  This approach best maximizes student-athlete welfare, our judging criteria.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) NCAA. (2023). *2022-2023 NCAA Finances*.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals mischaracterize the financial realities faced by student-athletes and offer no viable solutions to improve their well-being. Their arguments, rooted in an outdated view of amateurism, fail to address how maximizing student-athlete welfare strengthens, not undermines, the collegiate model.<br><br>First, the negative side attempts to differentiate NIL deals from profit-sharing, claiming the former preserves amateurism while the latter leads to professionalism. However, this distinction is flawed. While NIL deals are individual agreements, they are predicated on the university’s platform and team success, generated *by the athletes*. Profit-sharing simply acknowledges this shared contribution to revenue generation.  The negative side’s concern about prioritizing financial gain over education is unfounded.  Studies show a correlation between financial stability and improved academic performance among students, reducing stress and allowing for better focus .  Therefore, by ensuring fair compensation, we empower student-athletes to excel both athletically and academically, upholding a key tenet of the collegiate model.<br><br>Second, the negative side claims that full scholarships adequately address student-athlete financial needs. This directly contradicts research showing that a significant percentage of student-athletes, even those on full scholarships, report concerns about meeting daily expenses .  Furthermore, the negative side ignores the fact that the total value of a full athletic scholarship often falls short of the actual cost of attendance, especially in expensive college towns .  This can create significant financial strain, particularly for athletes from low-income backgrounds. The negative side’s “double payment” argument is a false analogy.  Athletic scholarships are earned, not gifted, and profit-sharing is not an extra payment but a rightful share of the revenue generated *by* these athletes. Providing a share of the profits enhances, not diminishes, the educational experience by reducing financial anxieties, therefore reinforcing the core principles of the collegiate model.<br><br>Third, the negative side argues that salary caps and revenue sharing would further professionalize college sports.  However, they offer no alternative solutions to address the existing and growing disparities in resources between universities.  These very mechanisms, successfully implemented in professional sports, are designed to ensure a level playing field . We acknowledge the complexities of such systems, but these complexities are a small price to pay for a fairer, more equitable system. Their attempt to differentiate between academic and athletic financial support is also illogical. Both are tied to achievement. Addressing athletic financial needs is no different than addressing academic financial needs; both are essential for a well-rounded collegiate experience. By dismissing solutions that would create a fairer and more sustainable system, the negative side actually jeopardizes the long-term health of the collegiate model.<br><br>In conclusion, the negative side’s arguments are based on an outdated and impractical understanding of collegiate athletics. Their arguments fail to address the real financial pressures faced by student-athletes and misrepresent our proposal as a threat to the collegiate model.  By advocating for profit-sharing, coupled with appropriate regulations, we aim to maximize student-athlete welfare, which, in turn, strengthens the core principles of the collegiate model by promoting both academic and athletic success for all students.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1)  Brown, K.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate revolves around the crucial question of whether student-athletes should receive profits from college sports revenue. We firmly believe they should.<br><br>The negative side clings to an outdated notion of amateurism, suggesting that compensating student-athletes somehow taints their love for the game.  This is a false dichotomy.  Professional athletes, compensated handsomely for their labor, are still driven by passion.  Studies show a direct correlation between financial stability and improved academic performance , reducing stress and allowing for better focus.  Furthermore, the current NIL landscape demonstrates that compensation and collegiate athletics can coexist .  Profit-sharing simply formalizes and expands this existing reality, ensuring fairness and equity for all student-athletes, not just those with lucrative endorsement deals.  By addressing financial anxieties, we empower students to prioritize both their athletic and academic pursuits, upholding the true spirit of the collegiate model.<br><br>The negative side also claims that scholarships adequately compensate student-athletes.  This ignores the significant gap between scholarship amounts and the true cost of attendance, especially in high-cost areas .  Research indicates that a substantial percentage of student-athletes, even those on full scholarships, express concerns about meeting daily expenses . This financial strain forces many athletes to take on outside jobs, potentially detracting from both their athletic and academic pursuits.  Profit-sharing provides a much-needed safety net, allowing athletes to focus on their education and their sport without the added burden of financial insecurity. This directly improves student-athlete welfare, aligning with the core values of higher education.<br><br>Finally, the negative side argues that our proposed solutions, such as salary caps and revenue sharing, further professionalize college sports. However, these very mechanisms are designed to promote competitive balance and prevent runaway spending, as demonstrated in professional leagues .  They offer no viable alternatives, instead choosing to ignore the existing and growing disparities between institutions.  We acknowledge the complexities of such systems, but these are far outweighed by the benefits of a fairer and more equitable system for all student-athletes.<br><br>Fairness dictates that those who contribute to the immense revenue generated by college sports should share in the profits.  This isn't about professionalizing college sports; it's about recognizing the value and contributions of student-athletes. By ensuring fair compensation, we enhance the educational experience, promote financial stability, and uphold the true principles of collegiate athletics.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Brown, K.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today's debate centers on a fundamental question: what is the purpose of collegiate athletics?  The affirmative argues for a pay-for-play system, claiming it modernizes amateurism.  We argue it fundamentally *undermines* it, jeopardizing the very essence of the collegiate model and the long-term well-being of student-athletes.<br><br>Their argument that paying athletes reflects a modern understanding of amateurism is a fallacy.  Introducing salaries inevitably diminishes the intrinsic motivation of student-athletes, shifting their focus from the love of the game to financial gain. While NIL deals allow for endorsements, direct payment from universities blurs the line between student and professional, turning college sports into a minor league farm system.  This shift, as Guttmann  explains, undermines the historical and philosophical underpinnings of amateurism, eroding the values that make college sports unique.<br><br>The affirmative claims scholarships are insufficient, pointing to the financial struggles faced by some athletes.  However, they fail to acknowledge the substantial investment universities already make in student-athletes . Moreover, a pay-for-play system would create an unsustainable financial burden on athletic departments, potentially impacting non-revenue sports, coaching salaries, and even alumni donations.  The long-term consequences for the financial stability of universities could be devastating.  Instead of a radical restructuring, we advocate for targeted solutions, like increased need-based stipends and financial literacy programs , that address the genuine needs of student-athletes without jeopardizing the future of college sports.<br><br>Furthermore, their assertion that salary caps can address competitive imbalance is naive.  Implementing and enforcing such a system in college sports would be a logistical and legal nightmare, especially considering Title IX implications. How do you fairly compensate athletes across men's and women's sports with vastly different revenue streams?  A pay-for-play model risks creating legal challenges and exacerbating existing inequalities, potentially leading to lawsuits and sanctions. As Zimbalist  highlights, such disparities threaten the very foundations of fair competition.<br><br>The collegiate model offers something far more valuable than a paycheck: an education. It prepares student-athletes not just for a few years of professional sports, but for a lifetime of success.  It instills values of teamwork, discipline, and perseverance that transcend the playing field.  By preserving the integrity of the collegiate model, we invest in the *future* of student-athletes, empowering them to achieve their full potential, both on and off the court, long after their playing days are over. Let us not sacrifice this invaluable opportunity for the fleeting allure of a paycheck.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Guttmann, A. (1982).
