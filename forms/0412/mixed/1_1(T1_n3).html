                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a household that approves a budget but then refuses to pay the bills. The debt ceiling is like that refusal, causing unnecessary financial stress and potential damage. Today, we stand firm that the United States should abolish the debt ceiling. To clarify, the debt ceiling is a legislative limit on the amount of national debt the Treasury can issue. It does *not* authorize new spending; rather, it allows the government to pay for obligations Congress has *already* approved.<br><br>Our judging criteria are simple: which side promotes greater economic stability and social welfare? We contend that abolishing the debt ceiling achieves both.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling reduces economic uncertainty by preventing artificial crises. The debt ceiling creates manufactured fiscal cliffs, disrupting markets and hindering investment. When the debt ceiling nears, political brinkmanship often ensues, unnerving investors and businesses. According to Moody's Analytics, a prolonged breach of the debt ceiling would spark a recession, kill 7 million jobs, spike the unemployment rate to almost 9 percent, erase trillions in household wealth and retirement savings, and shrink the U.S. economy by over 4 percent . Removing the debt ceiling will foster stability and encourage long-term economic growth.<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling disproportionately harms vulnerable populations by threatening social safety nets. Imagine seniors unsure if they will receive their Social Security checks on time, or families facing potential cuts to vital healthcare services. These are the human costs of debt ceiling brinkmanship. Debt ceiling crises often lead to calls for spending cuts. When the debt ceiling becomes a political tool, programs like Social Security and Medicare are held hostage. All Home CEO and Founder Tomiquia Moss stated that the debt ceiling agreement will likely reduce vital food assistance and housing support for more than 100,000 Californians . This creates immense anxiety for millions of Americans who rely on these vital services.<br><br>Third, the debt ceiling is a redundant mechanism because Congress already exercises control over federal spending. It is unnecessary and a potentially harmful political tool. Congress *already* approves all spending through the budget process. The debt ceiling simply limits the Treasury's ability to pay for those authorized expenditures. It's like approving a purchase but then refusing to pay the bill. The Republican tax cuts of 2017 raised the deficit by an estimated $1 trillion over the next decade, despite promises that the cuts would pay for themselves . This demonstrates how the debt ceiling has been used as a political bargaining chip. Throughout history, other developed nations, like Canada and Australia, have managed their finances without a debt ceiling, demonstrating its dispensability.<br><br>The 2011 debt ceiling crisis led to a credit downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard & Poor’s . The Budget Control Act  enacted in 2011 in response to the crisis included $917 billion in direct spending reductions over 10 years .<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling is a dangerous and unnecessary relic. By abolishing it, we can promote economic stability, protect vulnerable populations, and streamline our government's financial processes. Contact your representatives and urge them to co-sponsor legislation to permanently abolish the debt ceiling. Tell them that the time for artificial crises and potential economic instability is over. We urge you to consider the evidence and vote in favor of abolishing the debt ceiling for a stronger and more secure future.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Debt Ceiling Explainer | House Budget Committee Democrats.

                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue against the abolition of the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is defined as the total amount of money that the United States government is allowed to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and other payments . It is crucial to understand the debt ceiling as a limit on borrowing to fulfill *existing* obligations.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **fiscal prudence**. The optimal policy regarding the debt ceiling is the one that best ensures long-term fiscal prudence and economic stability for the United States. We define fiscal prudence as responsible management of government finances, characterized by sustainable debt levels, controlled spending, and avoidance of actions that could lead to economic crises. This is the most appropriate standard because it directly addresses the core concern surrounding the debt ceiling: the nation's financial health and stability.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling removes a critical mechanism for fiscal oversight and accountability. The debt ceiling, though often a point of political contention, forces Congress to periodically review and authorize government borrowing. This process provides a crucial opportunity for debate and scrutiny of government spending. Removing this mechanism eliminates a layer of oversight, potentially leading to unchecked spending and increased national debt. For example, in 1995, Republican members of Congress used the threat of refusing to allow an increase in the debt ceiling to negotiate increased government spending cuts . This demonstrates the debt ceiling's potential to curb excessive spending. Some analysts argue that by requiring legislative consent, the debt limit affords Congress some oversight authority and engenders fiscal accountability . The debt ceiling can therefore be a useful tool to remind everyone of the burden of debt to the economy .<br><br>Second, abolishing the debt ceiling creates the risk of unlimited government borrowing, leading to economic instability. Without a limit on borrowing, the government could potentially accumulate unsustainable levels of debt, leading to higher interest rates, inflation, and a potential economic crisis. Unlimited borrowing can also crowd out private investment and undermine long-term economic growth. As *The Economist* notes, the US federal government has spent $2 trillion, or 7.2% of GDP, more than it has raised in taxes recently, despite a strong economy . This level of borrowing, even with the debt ceiling in place, raises concerns about fiscal responsibility. Removing the debt ceiling could exacerbate this trend, potentially leading to higher interest rates and reduced government services .<br><br>Third, alternatives to abolishing the debt ceiling offer more effective and less risky approaches to fiscal management. Instead of completely removing the debt ceiling, there are alternative mechanisms that can improve fiscal responsibility, such as linking debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions or capping the debt-to-GDP ratio. These alternatives maintain a degree of fiscal control without the drastic risks associated with abolishing the debt ceiling entirely. The Government Accountability Office  has recommended that Congress consider replacing the current debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions at the time they are made . This approach could provide a more comprehensive and responsible framework for managing the national debt.<br><br>In conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal prudence and economic stability. It removes a vital mechanism for oversight, invites unlimited borrowing, and neglects more effective alternative solutions. We, therefore, stand firmly against the abolition of the debt ceiling.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) NPR. 2023. An economist’s case for abolishing the debt ceiling.

                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">They define the debt ceiling as the total amount of money the U.S. government is allowed to borrow. We agree, but let's be clear: this is about paying for obligations Congress *already* approved. Our debate centers on which approach truly fosters greater economic stability and social welfare for all Americans.<br><br>Now, let’s dismantle their argument that the debt ceiling provides fiscal oversight. It's like seeing the "check engine" light come on in your car, and instead of addressing the underlying issue, you ignore it, potentially causing a breakdown. Ignoring the debt ceiling, like ignoring that "check engine" light, leads to serious consequences, including market jitters and economic instability. The debt ceiling manufactures crises, it doesn't prevent them. The "discipline" they claim it imposes is performative, not responsible. These recurring "market jitters" are not a "small price"; they significantly impede economic growth. The debt ceiling crisis is not a genuine re-evaluation of fiscal policy, but a manufactured political spectacle that undermines economic stability. Remember the 2011 debt ceiling crisis? The brinksmanship led Standard & Poor’s to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time .<br><br>We have demonstrated that the debt ceiling creates artificial crises. It damages the nation’s credit rating, leading to broad economic pain. According to AAF, debt ceiling impasses negatively affect the world’s view of the United States as a reliable partner and investors’ perceptions of Treasury securities as safe, stable investments . By removing the *threat* of artificial crises, we foster a more stable economic environment.<br><br>They also ignore that debt ceiling brinkmanship disproportionately harms vulnerable populations by creating uncertainty around Social Security, Medicare, and vital services. A recent study shows that a new debt ceiling deal includes fresh work reporting requirements for adults ages 50 to 54 who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  benefits, and this change could result in almost 750,000 adults losing their federal food assistance . Their alternatives still carry risks of political gridlock!<br><br>Let's be clear: Congress *already* controls federal spending! The debt ceiling is therefore a redundant mechanism. As we've seen, and as evidenced by the experiences of countries like Canada and Australia, sound fiscal management is possible *without* it. Why can't the U.S. follow suit?<br><br>The claim that the debt ceiling is needed to control spending is demonstrably false. The continuous increase in national debt occurs *despite* the existence of the debt ceiling, highlighting its ineffectiveness as a fiscal constraint. The 'safety valve' they describe consistently harms consumer confidence and market stability. Their idea that the debt ceiling is a form of 'accountability' is really a charade, fostering political games, not genuine fiscal discipline. Fitch Ratings has issued credit warnings for the United States, pointing to the "brinkmanship over the debt ceiling" and the "failure of the U.S. authorities to meaningfully tackle medium-term fiscal challenges" as signals of "downside risks to U.S. creditworthiness" .<br><br>The debt ceiling has never truly been about fiscal prudence. It has been used as a political tool. Don't let political games continue to jeopardize our economic future. Urge your representatives to support the abolition of the debt ceiling and promote a more stable and prosperous America.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Why It Matters if the U.S. Credit Rating Is Downgraded—Again.<br>[2] The United States Breaches $36.1 Trillion Debt Ceiling - AAF.<br>[3] Debt ceiling deal: Some 750000 adults may lose SNAP ...<br>[4] Fitch Issues US Credit Warning over Debt Ceiling Delays.</div>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition’s rebuttals contain several flaws, specifically in their understanding of fiscal responsibility and the role of the debt ceiling. We will address their points concerning the "check engine" light analogy, the creation of artificial crises, the harm to vulnerable populations, the comparison to Canada and Australia, the continuous increase in national debt, and the 2011 downgrade.<br><br>First, they use the analogy of a "check engine" light to dismiss the debt ceiling, but this is a false analogy. The "check engine" light indicates an existing problem, while the debt ceiling *prevents* a future problem – unchecked government spending. Both sides acknowledge potential "market jitters," but we argue that these are a necessary and acceptable consequence of maintaining fiscal responsibility to ensure financial stability in the long term .<br><br>Second, the opposition claims the debt ceiling manufactures crises, but the potential for a crisis is a *feature*, not a bug. It forces Congress to confront the issue of spending and borrowing. They focus on short-term "market jitters" while ignoring the long-term consequences of unchecked debt. The debt ceiling provides a credible commitment to limit spending, preventing economic disaster .<br><br>Third, while we acknowledge the potential harm to vulnerable populations, we argue that long-term fiscal irresponsibility resulting from abolishing the debt ceiling would ultimately harm these populations *even more*. The debt ceiling is a mechanism to protect the long-term financial health of the country, which is essential for maintaining social safety nets .<br><br>Fourth, the opposition points to Canada and Australia as examples of sound fiscal management without a debt ceiling, but their economic and political situations are different from the U.S. Their fiscal management systems may not be directly applicable here, and we must consider the unique challenges facing the U.S. economy .<br><br>Fifth, the continuous increase in national debt *despite* the debt ceiling is a reason to maintain it, not abolish it. Eliminating the debt ceiling would remove the last remaining constraint on government spending. Unlimited borrowing can lead to higher interest rates, inflation, and economic instability, harming future generations .<br><br>Sixth, regarding the 2011 downgrade, while we acknowledge it, it was a *one-time* event triggered by a specific political situation of failing to pass the debt ceiling. This actually *proves* that the debt ceiling is a mechanism to drive fiscal decisions, ensuring that the government addresses its spending habits .<br><br>In conclusion, we maintain that abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal prudence and economic stability. It removes a vital mechanism for oversight, invites unlimited borrowing, and neglects more effective alternative solutions. For these reasons, we stand firmly against the abolition of the debt ceiling.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) NPR. 2023. An economist’s case for abolishing the debt ceiling.

                                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let's be clear: while the opposition frames this debate around economic stability and social welfare, the central issue is fiscal prudence. Fiscal prudence, the responsible management of government finances, is the bedrock upon which long-term economic stability and social welfare are built. A strong society requires a strong financial base, and fiscal prudence provides that foundation.<br><br>The opposition claims the debt ceiling "manufactures crises." However, the debt ceiling is a necessary mechanism that forces Congress to confront spending decisions. Prior to establishing the debt ceiling, Congress was required to approve each issuance of debt in a separate piece of legislation. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the debt ceiling was first enacted in 1917 through the Second Liberty Bond Act to simplify the process and enhance borrowing flexibility . Think of the debt ceiling as a financial check-up. It may be uncomfortable, forcing us to confront tough choices, but is it better to ignore warning signs and risk a complete financial collapse? The debt ceiling forces Congress to review borrowing, offering opportunities to scrutinize spending. Removing this oversight is akin to giving a teenager a credit card with no limit. What could possibly go wrong?<br><br>They argue that Congress already controls spending, but does it *really*? Look at the national debt! The debt ceiling forces a specific vote on debt, compelling representatives to confront the consequences of their choices. It's more than just political brinkmanship. As John Cochrane noted, the regular budget process is completely broken, and the debt ceiling is one deadline that forces some spending/tax compromises .<br><br>The opposition claims the debt ceiling undermines economic stability, but the opposite is true. Removing the debt ceiling creates the *real* risk of unlimited government borrowing. Imagine a car with no brakes! Unchecked borrowing leads to higher interest rates, inflation, and ultimately, economic disaster. According to a 2023 report from Moody’s Analytics, even a short-term breach of the federal debt limit could reduce gross domestic product and result in the loss of 2 million jobs . The debt ceiling is a safety valve, reminding everyone of the dangers of reckless spending.<br><br>They point out that the national debt rises *despite* the debt ceiling. The solution is to *strengthen* the tool, not discard it. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests linking changes in the debt limit to achieving responsible fiscal targets, so that Congress would not need to increase the debt ceiling if fiscal targets are met . Like anything, the debt ceiling can be improved.<br><br>Finally, they argue the debt ceiling harms vulnerable populations. No one wants to see Social Security or Medicare threatened. However, is the solution to remove all fiscal controls? Responsible negotiations, not reckless borrowing, are the way to protect those who need it most. By ensuring fiscal prudence, essential social programs are sustainable and protected from long-term budget cuts. Removing the ceiling grants unlimited borrowing power, incentivizing more spending in the long run, which will affect everyone, including the vulnerable. As Stanford Silverman notes, higher borrowing costs would increase the cost of financing public debt, leading to a decrease in public investment, affecting everything from infrastructure projects to social welfare programs .<br><br>Vote against abolishing the debt ceiling.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.
