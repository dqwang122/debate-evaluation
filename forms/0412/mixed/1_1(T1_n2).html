                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a household that approves a budget but then refuses to pay the bills. The debt ceiling is like that refusal, causing unnecessary financial stress and potential damage. Today, we stand firm that the United States should abolish the debt ceiling. To clarify, the debt ceiling is a legislative limit on the amount of national debt the Treasury can issue. It does *not* authorize new spending; rather, it allows the government to pay for obligations Congress has *already* approved.<br><br>Our judging criteria are simple: which side promotes greater economic stability and social welfare? We contend that abolishing the debt ceiling achieves both.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling reduces economic uncertainty by preventing artificial crises. The debt ceiling creates manufactured fiscal cliffs, disrupting markets and hindering investment. When the debt ceiling nears, political brinkmanship often ensues, unnerving investors and businesses. According to Moody's Analytics, a prolonged breach of the debt ceiling would spark a recession, kill 7 million jobs, spike the unemployment rate to almost 9 percent, erase trillions in household wealth and retirement savings, and shrink the U.S. economy by over 4 percent . Removing the debt ceiling will foster stability and encourage long-term economic growth.<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling disproportionately harms vulnerable populations by threatening social safety nets. Imagine seniors unsure if they will receive their Social Security checks on time, or families facing potential cuts to vital healthcare services. These are the human costs of debt ceiling brinkmanship. Debt ceiling crises often lead to calls for spending cuts. When the debt ceiling becomes a political tool, programs like Social Security and Medicare are held hostage. All Home CEO and Founder Tomiquia Moss stated that the debt ceiling agreement will likely reduce vital food assistance and housing support for more than 100,000 Californians . This creates immense anxiety for millions of Americans who rely on these vital services.<br><br>Third, the debt ceiling is a redundant mechanism because Congress already exercises control over federal spending. It is unnecessary and a potentially harmful political tool. Congress *already* approves all spending through the budget process. The debt ceiling simply limits the Treasury's ability to pay for those authorized expenditures. It's like approving a purchase but then refusing to pay the bill. The Republican tax cuts of 2017 raised the deficit by an estimated $1 trillion over the next decade, despite promises that the cuts would pay for themselves . This demonstrates how the debt ceiling has been used as a political bargaining chip. Throughout history, other developed nations, like Canada and Australia, have managed their finances without a debt ceiling, demonstrating its dispensability.<br><br>The 2011 debt ceiling crisis led to a credit downgrade of U.S. debt by Standard & Poor’s . The Budget Control Act  enacted in 2011 in response to the crisis included $917 billion in direct spending reductions over 10 years .<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling is a dangerous and unnecessary relic. By abolishing it, we can promote economic stability, protect vulnerable populations, and streamline our government's financial processes. Contact your representatives and urge them to co-sponsor legislation to permanently abolish the debt ceiling. Tell them that the time for artificial crises and potential economic instability is over. We urge you to consider the evidence and vote in favor of abolishing the debt ceiling for a stronger and more secure future.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Debt Ceiling Explainer | House Budget Committee Democrats.

                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue against the abolition of the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is defined as the total amount of money that the United States government is allowed to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and other payments . It is crucial to understand the debt ceiling as a limit on borrowing to fulfill *existing* obligations.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **fiscal prudence**. The optimal policy regarding the debt ceiling is the one that best ensures long-term fiscal prudence and economic stability for the United States. We define fiscal prudence as responsible management of government finances, characterized by sustainable debt levels, controlled spending, and avoidance of actions that could lead to economic crises. This is the most appropriate standard because it directly addresses the core concern surrounding the debt ceiling: the nation's financial health and stability.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling removes a critical mechanism for fiscal oversight and accountability. The debt ceiling, though often a point of political contention, forces Congress to periodically review and authorize government borrowing. This process provides a crucial opportunity for debate and scrutiny of government spending. Removing this mechanism eliminates a layer of oversight, potentially leading to unchecked spending and increased national debt. For example, in 1995, Republican members of Congress used the threat of refusing to allow an increase in the debt ceiling to negotiate increased government spending cuts . This demonstrates the debt ceiling's potential to curb excessive spending. Some analysts argue that by requiring legislative consent, the debt limit affords Congress some oversight authority and engenders fiscal accountability . The debt ceiling can therefore be a useful tool to remind everyone of the burden of debt to the economy .<br><br>Second, abolishing the debt ceiling creates the risk of unlimited government borrowing, leading to economic instability. Without a limit on borrowing, the government could potentially accumulate unsustainable levels of debt, leading to higher interest rates, inflation, and a potential economic crisis. Unlimited borrowing can also crowd out private investment and undermine long-term economic growth. As *The Economist* notes, the US federal government has spent $2 trillion, or 7.2% of GDP, more than it has raised in taxes recently, despite a strong economy . This level of borrowing, even with the debt ceiling in place, raises concerns about fiscal responsibility. Removing the debt ceiling could exacerbate this trend, potentially leading to higher interest rates and reduced government services .<br><br>Third, alternatives to abolishing the debt ceiling offer more effective and less risky approaches to fiscal management. Instead of completely removing the debt ceiling, there are alternative mechanisms that can improve fiscal responsibility, such as linking debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions or capping the debt-to-GDP ratio. These alternatives maintain a degree of fiscal control without the drastic risks associated with abolishing the debt ceiling entirely. The Government Accountability Office  has recommended that Congress consider replacing the current debt limit with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions at the time they are made . This approach could provide a more comprehensive and responsible framework for managing the national debt.<br><br>In conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal prudence and economic stability. It removes a vital mechanism for oversight, invites unlimited borrowing, and neglects more effective alternative solutions. We, therefore, stand firmly against the abolition of the debt ceiling.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) NPR. 2023. An economist’s case for abolishing the debt ceiling.

                                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments contain three key flaws, relating to judging criteria, fiscal oversight, and the risk of unlimited borrowing.<br><br>First, the opposition argues for "fiscal prudence" as the primary judging criterion. However, we contend that this misses the forest for the trees. Economic stability and social welfare are *preconditions* for fiscal prudence. How can any nation be fiscally responsible amidst economic chaos or widespread social distress? Focusing solely on managing resources, as the opposition suggests, neglects the crucial outcomes of stability and well-being. Numerous economists, such as those at the Brookings Institute , emphasize that economic stability is vital for long-term fiscal health. We maintain our stance that the optimal policy promotes greater economic stability and social welfare, as these are the foundations upon which fiscal prudence can be built.<br><br>Second, the opposition claims that the debt ceiling is a critical mechanism for fiscal oversight, forcing Congress to review government spending. This argument ignores the fundamental reality that Congress *already* approves all spending through the budget process . The debt ceiling, therefore, is nothing more than a redundant second review of the same expenditures. It’s akin to approving a purchase and then refusing to pay the bill. This duplication not only wastes time and resources but also creates opportunities for political brinkmanship, as evidenced by the 2011 debt ceiling crisis that led to a credit downgrade of U.S. debt . Instead of ensuring fiscal responsibility, the debt ceiling has become a political tool that threatens economic stability. Many developed nations, like Canada and Australia, manage their finances effectively without a debt ceiling , demonstrating that budget process is the proper mechanism for fiscal oversight.<br><br>Third, the opposition warns that abolishing the debt ceiling creates the risk of unlimited government borrowing. This claim rests on the unsupported assumption that abolishing the debt ceiling *automatically* leads to fiscal irresponsibility. However, as Treasury.gov indicates, other effective mechanisms exist to prevent unlimited borrowing, including budget resolutions, congressional oversight, and public pressure . The debt ceiling itself has often *exacerbated* fiscal mismanagement by creating artificial deadlines and political brinkmanship , not the other way around. Furthermore, the opposition fails to acknowledge that several countries, such as New Zealand and Sweden, have successfully managed government borrowing without a debt ceiling . The issue at hand is not the *existence* of a debt ceiling, but the potential for it to trigger artificial crises and undermine economic stability.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Brookings Institute.

We agree, but let's be clear: this is about paying for obligations Congress *already* approved. Our debate centers on which approach truly fosters greater economic stability and social welfare for all Americans.<br><br>Now, let’s dismantle their argument that the debt ceiling provides fiscal oversight. It's like seeing the "check engine" light come on in your car, and instead of addressing the underlying issue, you ignore it, potentially causing a breakdown. Ignoring the debt ceiling, like ignoring that "check engine" light, leads to serious consequences, including market jitters and economic instability. The debt ceiling manufactures crises, it doesn't prevent them. The "discipline" they claim it imposes is performative, not responsible. These recurring "market jitters" are not a "small price"; they significantly impede economic growth. The debt ceiling crisis is not a genuine re-evaluation of fiscal policy, but a manufactured political spectacle that undermines economic stability. Remember the 2011 debt ceiling crisis? The brinksmanship led Standard & Poor’s to downgrade the U.S. credit rating for the first time .<br><br>We have demonstrated that the debt ceiling creates artificial crises. It damages the nation’s credit rating, leading to broad economic pain. According to AAF, debt ceiling impasses negatively affect the world’s view of the United States as a reliable partner and investors’ perceptions of Treasury securities as safe, stable investments . By removing the *threat* of artificial crises, we foster a more stable economic environment.<br><br>They also ignore that debt ceiling brinkmanship disproportionately harms vulnerable populations by creating uncertainty around Social Security, Medicare, and vital services. A recent study shows that a new debt ceiling deal includes fresh work reporting requirements for adults ages 50 to 54 who receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  benefits, and this change could result in almost 750,000 adults losing their federal food assistance . Their alternatives still carry risks of political gridlock!<br><br>Let's be clear: Congress *already* controls federal spending! The debt ceiling is therefore a redundant mechanism. As we've seen, and as evidenced by the experiences of countries like Canada and Australia, sound fiscal management is possible *without* it. Why can't the U.S. follow suit?<br><br>The claim that the debt ceiling is needed to control spending is demonstrably false. The continuous increase in national debt occurs *despite* the existence of the debt ceiling, highlighting its ineffectiveness as a fiscal constraint. The 'safety valve' they describe consistently harms consumer confidence and market stability. Their idea that the debt ceiling is a form of 'accountability' is really a charade, fostering political games, not genuine fiscal discipline. Fitch Ratings has issued credit warnings for the United States, pointing to the "brinkmanship over the debt ceiling" and the "failure of the U.S. authorities to meaningfully tackle medium-term fiscal challenges" as signals of "downside risks to U.S. creditworthiness" .<br><br>The debt ceiling has never truly been about fiscal prudence. It has been used as a political tool. Don't let political games continue to jeopardize our economic future. Urge your representatives to support the abolition of the debt ceiling and promote a more stable and prosperous America.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Why It Matters if the U.S. Credit Rating Is Downgraded—Again.<br>[2] The United States Breaches $36.1 Trillion Debt Ceiling - AAF.<br>[3] Debt ceiling deal: Some 750000 adults may lose SNAP ...<br>[4] Fitch Issues US Credit Warning over Debt Ceiling Delays.
