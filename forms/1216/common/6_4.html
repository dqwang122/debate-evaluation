                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that escaping from big cities, defined as relocating from a major metropolitan area to a smaller town, suburb, or rural environment, is the way out, meaning a path to a better future, for today's young people (individuals aged 18-35).<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing overall well-being, meaning the side that best demonstrates how its position contributes to the physical, mental, and economic well-being of young people should win.<br><br>First, escaping big cities offers greater economic stability for young people.  The cost of living in large metropolitan areas is significantly higher than in smaller communities.  For example, according to Debt.com, rent and home prices are considerably lower in smaller towns, as are the costs of groceries and other consumer goods. This allows young people to save a larger portion of their income and build a stronger financial foundation.  Furthermore, smaller communities offer reduced competition for jobs and resources. As highlighted in a Peoria Magazine article, smaller towns offer niche market opportunities for entrepreneurs, facilitating business creation and self-employment.<br><br>Second, escaping big cities improves mental and physical well-being.  A study by King's College London found that urban dwellers have a 20% higher risk of developing depression compared to those living outside the city.  The fast-paced, high-stress environment of big cities contributes to anxiety and mental health challenges.  In contrast, smaller communities offer a slower pace of life, stronger social connections, and increased access to nature. Research from the NIHR highlights the positive correlation between access to green and blue spaces and improved mental health.  This improved mental well-being is further enhanced by the stronger sense of community found in smaller towns, as reported by NCESC, which fosters social support and reduces feelings of isolation.<br><br>Third, escaping big cities provides increased opportunity in the age of remote work. Business Insider reports that remote work and affordable housing are driving young Americans to move to rural areas. With remote work becoming increasingly prevalent, young people are no longer tied to major city centers for employment opportunities.  This allows them to prioritize quality of life and affordability, making smaller communities with lower living costs and access to nature attractive options.  This trend is supported by Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies, which notes the potential for decentralization and expansion of low-density urban growth fueled by remote work.  The ability to work remotely opens up a wider range of career options and reduces competition,  allowing young people to pursue careers they are passionate about without being constrained by geographical limitations.<br><br>In conclusion, escaping big cities offers young people a path to greater economic stability, improved mental and physical health, and increased opportunity in the modern era of remote work, ultimately contributing to a higher overall well-being.<br><br>Reference:<br>(1)  "Young families are leaving many large US cities — here’s why that matters," The Conversation.<br>(2) "Advantages and Disadvantages of Living in a Big City," Aspiring Youths.<br>(3) "Urban Loneliness and Isolation," Roots of Loneliness.<br>(4) "Young Americans are abandoning big cities for rural areas, reversing a decades-long trend," Business Insider.<br>(5) "5 Strategies to Attract Youth to Rural Communities," Peoria Magazine.<br>(6) "Equity and Economic Opportunity in Rural America," Rural Innovation.<br>(7) "Pros and Cons of Small Town Living," Debt.com.<br>(8) "What are the differences between living in big cities and living in small cities?"

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, have you ever considered what truly fuels a young person's dreams?  We believe it's the vibrant energy, the diverse opportunities, and the sheer possibility that thrives within our big cities.  That's why we stand firmly *against* the motion that escaping from big cities is the way out for today's young people. We believe that staying in, or returning to, major urban centers offers significantly *greater* opportunities for personal and professional growth.<br><br>Now, when we talk about "escaping" and "returning," we're talking about young people who have already experienced big city life.  The question is, should they pack their bags for smaller towns, or embrace the opportunities that cities offer? We believe the answer is clear: cities are the launchpads for young people's futures.<br><br>Our argument rests on three key pillars.  First, let's talk about careers.  For young professionals, climbing the ladder often depends on who you know.  Think about it – how many times have you heard, "It's not what you know, it's who you know"?  Big cities are *networking hubs*. They're buzzing with opportunities you just won't find anywhere else.  Studies show that most jobs are filled through networking (1), and large cities make this easier with countless industry events and professional organizations (2, 3). Leaving the city means missing out on these vital connections, potentially hindering your career growth. Imagine trying to build your career in a small town where everyone's already established and opportunities are limited.  The city is where you meet people, learn from the best, and build the relationships that propel you forward.<br><br>This brings me to my second point: the sheer *diversity* of industries in big cities.  Large cities offer an unparalleled range of career paths, allowing young people to explore different fields and discover their true passions.  Studies show a strong link between city size and industry diversity (4, 5).  Think of it this way: a small town might have one main industry, but a city like San Francisco has everything from energy and healthcare to banking and finance (6). This breadth of opportunity lets young professionals experiment, network, and find a career that truly fits their skills and passions.  It's like a buffet of opportunities, allowing you to sample different dishes and find what you truly love.  This exploration is much easier in a major urban center, where opportunities are concentrated and readily available.<br><br>Finally, and this is crucial for aspiring entrepreneurs, big cities are *start-up hotspots*.  Studies show a clear correlation between city size and business dynamism, with larger cities seeing higher rates of new businesses starting up (7).  Why?  Because cities have access to venture capital, as detailed in numerous reports on funding opportunities (8), and they're packed with support systems like incubators and accelerators, as highlighted in articles listing such resources in major cities (9, 10).  These factors give young entrepreneurs a significant edge in launching and growing their businesses.  Imagine pitching your groundbreaking idea to investors in a small town versus doing it in Silicon Valley.  The resources and connections available in big cities are simply unmatched.<br><br>So, while the peace and quiet of a smaller town might sound tempting, the reality is that big cities are the *engines of opportunity* for young people.  They offer a unique combination of industries, networks, and resources that fuels career growth, innovation, and entrepreneurial success.  We urge you to reject this motion and recognize the vital role big cities play in shaping the future of today's youth.  Let's invest in our cities, empower our young people, and build a brighter future together.<br><br><br>**Reference**<br><br><br>1. Cuzzy, F.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2"><br>Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement, while superficially appealing, rests on three flawed pillars: a distorted definition of "escaping," a myopic focus on limited career metrics, and a disregard for the comprehensive well-being fostered by smaller communities. We reiterate that "escaping" encompasses *all* young people seeking a better future, regardless of prior big-city experience, and maintain that such a move maximizes their overall well-being—physical, mental, and economic—the very criteria upon which this debate should be judged.<br><br>First, the opponent states, "Now, when we talk about 'escaping' and 'returning,' we're talking about young people who have already experienced big city life." This redefinition conveniently narrows the scope of the debate. We contend that "escaping" is a universal concept, signifying the pursuit of a more desirable situation. Their claim that big cities offer superior networking, stating "big cities are *networking hubs*," also lacks nuance.  While they emphasize professional networking, they fail to cite concrete evidence supporting their assertion that “most jobs are filled through networking."  A 2023 LinkedIn survey reveals that 45% of professionals secured their current role via online applications, highlighting the digitalization of job seeking. Moreover, intense competition and superficial connections in big cities can negatively impact mental well-being. Smaller communities, conversely, cultivate strong social ties, fostering a sense of belonging crucial for mental health, as documented by a 2020 meta-analysis in *Perspectives on Psychological Science* on loneliness and social isolation. This directly contributes to improved mental and emotional well-being, a key component of our judging criteria.<br><br>Second, the opponent champions the “sheer *diversity* of industries in big cities" using San Francisco as a singular example. They argue, "a small town might have one main industry, but a city like San Francisco has everything…" This comparison is misleading.  Smaller cities like Boulder, Colorado, with its thriving aerospace and natural products industries, and Burlington, Vermont, a hub for software development and sustainable businesses, demonstrate significant economic diversity, verifiable through data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Furthermore, they overlook the benefits of specialization, often nurtured in smaller communities with niche industries. For example, specialized agricultural expertise, advanced manufacturing skills relevant to local industries, or expertise in renewable energy technologies are often highly valued and sought after in smaller, rural communities, offering significant economic opportunities.  This specialization allows young people to develop valuable expertise, contributing directly to their economic well-being and career satisfaction.  While a comprehensive "Geography of Skills" report focusing specifically on 2024 is difficult to locate, existing research consistently points towards the increasing importance of specialized skills across diverse geographies.<br><br>Third, the opponent proclaims big cities as "*start-up hotspots*," citing access to venture capital. They claim, "Imagine pitching your groundbreaking idea to investors in a small town versus doing it in Silicon Valley." This argument ignores the evolving landscape of startup funding.  Crowdfunding, online investment platforms, and government initiatives like the USDA's Rural Business Development Grants program are increasingly channeling investment to smaller communities. Moreover, lower operating costs in smaller locales allow for more efficient use of limited resources, extending the runway for startups and directly contributing to higher survival rates.  This enhances the long-term economic well-being of young entrepreneurs.  While a specific 2022 Kauffman Foundation report on "The State of Entrepreneurship" is elusive, their ongoing research consistently emphasizes the importance of factors like affordable operating environments, which smaller communities offer.<br><br>In conclusion, the opponent's arguments fail to acknowledge the multifaceted benefits of escaping big cities. Our case demonstrates that this choice improves physical and mental well-being through stronger community bonds and reduced stress, and enhances economic well-being through lower living costs, diverse career opportunities, including specialized fields and niche markets, and a supportive entrepreneurial ecosystem. This holistic enhancement of well-being clearly affirms our stance.<br><br>Reference:<br>(1) LinkedIn.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, colleagues, fellow debaters, let’s talk about something that hits close to home for many of us: the allure of big city life versus the quieter charm of smaller towns.  Our opponents suggest young people should escape the hustle and bustle of big cities. But I’m here to tell you their argument just doesn’t hold water.<br><br>First, they talk about “escaping” as if it applies to every young person.  But this debate is about a *choice*: big city or small town?  It’s a decision for those who’ve tasted both.  Their broad definition misses the point entirely.<br><br>Second, let’s talk networking.  Sure, online applications exist.  But they miss the *magic* of big cities. Think about it: industry-specific events, conferences, workshops – they’re everywhere!  These aren’t just online clicks; they’re handshakes, coffee chats, brainstorming sessions.  Studies in the *Journal of Urban Economics* and *Regional Science and Urban Economics* show how these in-person connections lead to mentorship, collaboration, and career advancement – opportunities you rarely find in smaller towns.  The *Harvard Business Review* and *Forbes* have highlighted the importance of face-to-face networking.  Our opponents focus on online applications, but they ignore the real-world connections that drive a young professional’s career.<br><br>Third, they claim smaller communities offer similar economic diversity and startup resources.  Really?  Research consistently shows a strong link between city size and industry diversity, as documented in the *Journal of Economic Geography* and *Urban Studies*.  Larger cities naturally attract a wider range of industries, creating more robust economies and diverse career options.  This benefits startups too, giving them a larger pool of potential customers and partners.  While some smaller towns might have niche markets, the overall ecosystem for young professionals and startups thrives in major urban centers.  And again, networking – crucial for startups – is far more prevalent and impactful in large cities, as shown in *Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice* and the *Journal of Business Venturing*.  Big cities are where the venture capital and support systems are concentrated.<br><br>Let me reiterate: big cities are *networking hubs*.  For young professionals, career advancement hinges on strong networks.  Large cities are packed with industries and companies, leading to more networking events, conferences, and professional organizations.  Publications like the *International Journal of Urban and Regional Research*, *Urban Affairs Review*, and *Environment and Planning A* have explored this phenomenon.  This density creates more opportunities to connect with influential people, learn about job openings, and gain industry insights, as highlighted by the *Harvard Business Review* and *Forbes*.  Yes, online applications matter, but the personal connections forged in big city networking events often lead to faster career progression and access to unadvertised opportunities.<br><br>Finally, let’s not forget education.  Big cities, with their universities and research institutions, offer unmatched learning and research opportunities.  They provide access to cutting-edge facilities, renowned faculty, diverse academic programs, and vibrant intellectual communities.  The increased internship and career opportunities in major cities further enhance the educational experience and future prospects for young people.<br><br>So, escaping big cities?  Not the best advice for today’s young people.  The opportunities for networking, career exploration, educational advancement, and entrepreneurial success are simply far greater in urban centers.  We urge you to reject the motion and recognize the vital role big cities play in shaping the future of our youth.<br><br><br>**Reference**<br><br><br><br>1.  Meetup.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2"><br>Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges.  Today’s debate revolves around a fundamental question: what constitutes “the way out” for today’s young people?  Our team argues that it lies not in the relentless pursuit of big city dreams, but in the conscious choice to escape the confines of metropolitan life and embrace the diverse opportunities offered by smaller communities. This “escape” is not a retreat, but a strategic move towards a better future – one defined by enhanced well-being across its physical, mental, and economic dimensions.<br><br>The opposing team championed big cities as networking hubs, highlighting the value of in-person connections. However, they overlooked a crucial shift in the modern professional landscape: the rise of digital networking.  Platforms like LinkedIn, industry-specific forums, and virtual conferences democratize access to professional connections, regardless of location. This isn't just about finding jobs; it's about building a supportive network that fosters mentorship and collaboration, key elements often overshadowed by the superficiality of some big-city interactions. A 2023 LinkedIn survey found 45% of professionals secured their current role through online applications, proving that opportunity is no longer confined to crowded conference halls.<br><br>They also presented a skewed view of economic diversity, claiming it's a big-city exclusive.  But consider a young entrepreneur launching a sustainable farm-to-table restaurant in a thriving agricultural community. Their access to fresh, local produce, lower operating costs, and a tight-knit community provides a unique competitive edge – an advantage they wouldn't find in the saturated market of a metropolis.  Similarly, a software developer choosing a smaller city with a burgeoning tech scene benefits from lower living costs, reduced competition, and a greater sense of community, all while enjoying access to a robust and specialized job market.  These examples highlight the diverse and often overlooked opportunities thriving beyond big cities.<br><br>The opposing team focused on venture capital as the lifeblood of startups, neglecting the rise of alternative funding models. Crowdfunding, online investment platforms, and targeted government initiatives like the USDA’s Rural Business Development Grants program are actively injecting capital into smaller communities. This, coupled with significantly lower operating costs, provides startups in smaller communities a longer runway and a greater chance of success.<br><br>Finally, access to education is no longer solely dependent on large urban universities. Online education and the presence of specialized colleges and vocational schools in smaller towns offer diverse pathways to knowledge and skill development. This accessibility expands opportunities for personal and professional growth, regardless of location.<br><br>Escaping big cities doesn't just mean leaving; it means choosing a life of enhanced well-being. It means trading chronic stress for stronger community connections, exorbitant living costs for financial stability, and cutthroat competition for opportunities tailored to individual skills and passions.  It means choosing a path towards a truly better future, one where success is measured not just by career advancement but by overall fulfillment and a balanced life.<br><br>References:<br>(1) LinkedIn.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, judges, let’s talk about opportunity. Where do young people truly thrive?  Our opponents paint a charming picture of small-town life, but it just doesn't match the reality of today's interconnected world.  This boils down to *access*: access to the right people, the right industries, and the resources that fuel success.<br><br>Think about launching your career.  Sure, online job boards exist, but who hasn’t landed a job through a personal connection? Big cities are *networking hubs*.  They’re packed with industry-specific events, conferences, and workshops where you shake hands, exchange ideas, and build those crucial relationships.  These aren't just online clicks; they're the mentorships and collaborations that propel careers forward, especially in competitive fields.<br><br>Let's talk jobs. Big cities offer a *diversity of industries* you simply won't find elsewhere.  Think about the sheer number of startups, established companies, and everything in between. This creates more career paths, more innovation, and a dynamic environment where young professionals can explore their passions.  While some small towns have success stories, they're outliers, not the norm.  The real engine of economic growth?  It's in our urban centers.<br><br>Finally, consider where you want to live. Big cities offer *housing for everyone*, from bustling downtown apartments to quieter suburban communities.  Whether you're on a tight budget or looking for a specific lifestyle, you'll find it in the city.  That kind of flexibility is rare in smaller towns with limited options.<br><br>So, while small towns have their appeal, big cities are the *engines of opportunity*.  They offer the networks, industries, resources, and housing options that today's youth need to thrive.  Let's invest in the future, invest in our young people, and recognize the undeniable advantages of big cities.<br></div>
