                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>
                    <p>Participation in this study is limited to individuals who:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Age 18 and older</li>
                        <li>Have the ability to sign the consent form electronically</li>
                        <li>Have access to the Internet</li>
                        <li>Have a high school degree</li>
                        <li>Should be located in US</li>
                        <li>Must be fluent in written and spoken English</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, judges, esteemed colleagues, we stand before you today to affirm the resolution: If healthcare is a scarce resource, government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.  We recognize the gravity of this topic and the inherent ethical complexities it presents.  Therefore, we define “scarce resource” as demonstrably insufficient healthcare resources to meet all needs.  Our judging criteria for this debate will be maximizing overall societal benefit and long-term health outcomes. This criteria is reasonable because when resources are limited, we must prioritize actions that benefit the most people and ensure the sustainability of the healthcare system for future generations.<br><br>Let me turn to our first argument: government-led rationing allows for the prioritization of preventative care and public health initiatives, maximizing long-term health outcomes.  Consider this: the CDC emphasizes that preventative care, such as regular checkups and understanding your family history, helps prevent chronic diseases and lessens the severity of infectious diseases [1].  As you'll see, this is crucial because studies show four out of five leading causes of death are preventable or manageable with regular healthcare access [4]. Government rationing, while seemingly restrictive, can ensure these preventative services are prioritized when resources are scarce. By strategically redirecting resources towards preventative care, the government can mitigate the long-term health and economic burdens of chronic diseases, potentially saving more lives in the long run.<br><br>This brings me to our second point: rationing frees up resources for research and development of new treatments and technologies, addressing the root causes of scarcity. The scarcity of healthcare resources necessitates difficult choices. Rationing, while ethically complex, offers a mechanism for maximizing the impact of limited resources. Research indicates that by prioritizing high-impact treatments and restricting access to marginally beneficial interventions, we can free up resources [2].  Imagine if these freed-up resources could be strategically directed towards research and development, fueling the creation of new treatments and technologies. Studies show that rationing can stimulate innovation by creating a demand for more cost-effective and efficient healthcare solutions [2, 3, 5]. This proactive approach not only improves patient care but also contributes to the long-term sustainability of the healthcare system.<br><br>The crucial issue here is societal resilience, which is our third argument. Government-led rationing promotes societal resilience in the face of future health crises by establishing clear protocols for resource allocation.  History demonstrates that government-led rationing during crises, such as World War II rationing in the UK and the US, ensured equitable resource distribution and societal stability [6, 7, 8].  These programs, while not without challenges, successfully allocated scarce goods, preventing hoarding and chaos. This historical precedent strongly supports the government's role in establishing protocols for healthcare allocation in future health crises, thereby fostering societal resilience.<br><br>In conclusion, we believe that in situations of scarcity, government intervention through rationing becomes necessary, not to decide whose life is *not* worth saving, but to ensure the best possible outcomes for the greatest number of people.  By prioritizing preventative care, investing in research and development, and establishing protocols for future crises, government-led rationing offers a strategic and ultimately life-saving approach to managing scarce healthcare resources.  We urge you to affirm the resolution.<br><br><br>**Reference**<br><br>[1] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and honorable opponents,<br><br>Today, I stand before you to oppose the motion: *"If health care is a scarce resource, government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving."* While acknowledging the challenges posed by limited healthcare resources, I firmly believe that government-imposed rationing is not the solution. Instead, we should seek alternatives that uphold individual autonomy, promote efficiency, and ensure equitable access without compromising the quality of care.<br><br>**Definitions:**<br><br>- **Health Care:** Medical services provided to individuals to maintain or improve their health.<br>- **Scarce Resource:** A resource in limited supply relative to its demand.<br>- **Government Rationing:** Government-imposed allocation of limited resources, determining who receives certain services and who does not.<br><br>**Judging Criteria:**<br><br>The debate should be assessed based on the principles of individual autonomy, equity, and the effectiveness of healthcare delivery. The side that best demonstrates how to manage scarce resources while upholding these principles should prevail.<br><br>**Arguments:**<br><br>1. **Erosion of Individual Autonomy:**<br><br>   Government rationing of healthcare infringes upon personal autonomy by allowing the state to make life-and-death decisions for individuals. This centralization of power can lead to a loss of personal freedom in making healthcare choices.<br><br>   *According to an article from the Heritage Foundation, increased government control leads to patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions .* This undermines the patient-doctor relationship and can erode trust in the healthcare system.<br><br>2. **Inequitable Access and Discrimination:**<br><br>   Government rationing can inadvertently lead to discrimination and unequal treatment of certain populations. Decisions about who receives care may be influenced by biases, leading to disparities.<br><br>   *A study published in the "Journal of Environmental Science and Public Health" highlights that rationing can disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, exacerbating existing health disparities .* This is contrary to the ethical principle of justice, which demands fair treatment for all individuals.<br><br>3. **Negative Impact on Quality and Innovation:**<br><br>   Rationing often results in reduced incentives for healthcare providers to innovate or improve services. It can lead to longer wait times and decreased quality of care.<br><br>   *Data from the United States shows that private sector involvement in healthcare leads to better efficiency and innovation compared to government-run systems .* When providers compete, they are motivated to offer higher quality services to attract patients.<br><br>4. **Alternative Solutions Exist:**<br><br>   Instead of resorting to rationing, we should explore solutions that increase efficiency and reduce waste within the healthcare system. Empowering private enterprise, encouraging competition, and promoting personal responsibility can help address scarcity without imposing oppressive controls.<br><br>   *An article from "Economics Help.org" argues that private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition and profit motives driving improvements in quality and reduction of costs .*<br><br>**Conclusion:**<br><br>In conclusion, while healthcare scarcity is a pressing issue, government rationing is not the answer. It infringes on personal autonomy, risks unequal treatment, and stifles innovation. We should focus on enhancing efficiency, fostering competition, and respecting individual choices to create a more effective and equitable healthcare system. Let us seek solutions that uphold the dignity and freedom of every individual rather than allowing the government to decide whose life is worth saving.<br><br>Thank you.<br><br>---<br><br>**References:**<br><br>1.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">My opponents raise concerns about government rationing infringing upon personal autonomy. They argue that government involvement leads to a loss of personal freedom in healthcare choices. However, this argument misconstrues the role of government in healthcare.  The government's role can be to empower individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability, facilitating greater autonomy in healthcare decisions.  Think about it – increased access, due to government investment, can make more individuals active participants in their healthcare, not passive recipients as our opponents suggest, citing the Heritage Foundation. In fact, their argument overlooks how a well-designed rationing system can actually enhance individual freedom by expanding access to critical services, directly contradicting their claim.<br><br>They also claim that government rationing can lead to inequitable access and discrimination. While we acknowledge the potential for bias, examples of successful, transparent systems challenge this notion.  Consider road space rationing, where transparent criteria and public acceptance work together effectively [1].  Moreover, established priority protocols in resource allocation demonstrate the government's ability to prevent discrimination and ensure accountability [2].  These examples highlight that successful implementation relies on fairness, transparency, and accountability, elements achievable through proper governance, thereby mitigating the risk of inequity.<br><br>Furthermore, our opponents argue that rationing negatively impacts quality and innovation.  This simply isn’t true. Rationing, by its very nature, necessitates the efficient allocation of scarce resources, which can actually drive innovation in cost-effective treatments and care delivery. Research even supports this, demonstrating that resource scarcity encourages the development of innovative solutions [3, 4]. This directly contradicts our opponents' claim, showing that rationing can be a catalyst for, rather than an impediment to, innovation.<br><br>Now, let’s address a crucial point they overlooked: the risk of discriminatory practices by private entities in allocating scarce resources.  Government oversight is key here.  It promotes equitable resource allocation by establishing transparent criteria and accountability mechanisms.  The "Toolkit for Considering Equity When Conducting Oversight Work" emphasizes the government's role in ensuring accountability in resource use, minimizing the potential for discriminatory practices by private entities [5].  Furthermore, government agencies can direct resources to communities based on need through established guidelines [6], further reducing the likelihood of biased allocation by private actors.<br><br>Finally, our opponents suggest alternative solutions, focusing on efficiency and competition.  While these are important, they fail to address the immediate need for resource allocation in a scarcity scenario. A structured rationing system, however, facilitates data collection and analysis, enabling continuous improvement and refinement of allocation criteria [7].  This data-driven approach allows for easier identification of trends, resource allocation gaps, and areas for improvement, thereby promoting a more equitable and effective system. In contrast, their proposed solutions lack this structured approach to data analysis and system improvement.<br><br>In conclusion, while our opponents raise valid concerns, their arguments fail to consider the potential benefits and safeguards of a well-implemented government rationing system.  Our approach prioritizes not only individual liberties but also equitable access, innovation, and continuous improvement in resource allocation, ensuring the best possible outcomes in a situation of scarcity.<br><br><br>**Reference**<br><br>[1] FasterCapital.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen,<br><br>I have attentively considered my opponent's arguments advocating for government rationing of healthcare resources. While their intentions to ensure equitable access and enhance autonomy are commendable, their perspective overlooks fundamental issues inherent in such government intervention.<br><br>Firstly, my opponent contends that government rationing empowers individual choice by ensuring wider access and affordability. However, this view fails to acknowledge that increased government control often leads to diminished personal autonomy. As noted in an article by the Heritage Foundation, government-controlled healthcare can result in patients becoming passive recipients rather than active participants in their healthcare decisions. Centralizing decision-making with government officials strips individuals and their doctors of the ability to make personalized choices, replacing them with one-size-fits-all policies that cannot cater to the unique needs of each patient.<br><br>Moreover, the assertion that government involvement enhances access ignores the inefficiencies typically associated with bureaucratic systems. Countries with government-run healthcare often experience longer wait times and delays in receiving care. According to "Economics Help.org," increased government control can lead to decreased efficiency and reduced quality of care due to lack of competition and profit motive. This undermines the very autonomy and timely access my opponent suggests will be improved.<br><br>Secondly, my opponent draws parallels between healthcare rationing and road space rationing, citing it as an example of successful government intervention. This comparison is flawed. Managing traffic congestion is vastly different from making life-and-death healthcare decisions. Healthcare involves complex, deeply personal choices that cannot be effectively governed by broad, generalized protocols without sacrificing individual needs and ethical considerations.<br><br>While my opponent argues that government rationing can prevent discrimination through established priority protocols, history demonstrates that government systems are not immune to bias and inequality. Bureaucratic decision-making can inadvertently perpetuate systemic disparities. Vulnerable populations may continue to face barriers within a government-controlled system, and the lack of accountability can make it difficult to address these injustices.<br><br>Thirdly, the claim that rationing spurs innovation by necessitating efficient resource allocation overlooks the reality that innovation thrives in competitive environments. Government rationing can stifle innovation by imposing funding limitations and removing incentives for private entities to invest in research and development. The private sector, driven by competition and the pursuit of excellence, is more likely to produce innovative solutions that improve care and reduce costs.<br><br>Furthermore, my opponent warns of discriminatory practices by private entities and suggests that government oversight is the remedy. However, excessive government intervention can lead to increased bureaucracy and red tape, hindering the responsiveness and adaptability of the healthcare system. Proper regulation, rather than outright control, can mitigate risks without compromising efficiency and patient-centered care.<br><br>Lastly, my opponent critiques market-based solutions for not addressing immediate scarcity. Yet, evidence indicates that enhancing efficiency and fostering competition can effectively manage resources. As highlighted by "Economics Help.org," private healthcare provision can lead to more efficient outcomes due to competition driving improvements in quality and cost reduction<br><br>**Reference**<br>1.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, the core conflict lies in how we address the harsh reality of scarce healthcare resources.  Our opponents argue for market-based solutions, prioritizing individual autonomy and competition.  However, their approach fails to address the immediate and pressing need for equitable allocation in a scarcity scenario.  We, on the other hand, advocate for government-led rationing, not to restrict care, but to strategically allocate it, maximizing benefit for all.<br><br>We've demonstrated that government rationing, through transparent criteria and public input, can prioritize preventative care, boosting long-term health outcomes. This proactive approach, unlike our opponents' reactive market-based solutions, addresses the root causes of healthcare scarcity.  We’ve also shown how rationing can free up resources for research and development, fostering innovation and building a more resilient healthcare system.  Our opponents' concerns about stifled innovation simply don’t hold up against the evidence.  Moreover, government oversight minimizes the potential for discriminatory practices, ensuring equitable access for all, a critical point our opponents failed to address adequately.  Their arguments about individual autonomy, while important, ring hollow when access to essential care is limited by market forces.<br><br>In closing, we believe that when faced with scarcity, our collective well-being must come first.  Government-led rationing, through careful planning, transparency, and a commitment to equitable access, offers the most effective and just solution. We urge you to affirm the resolution.<br></div>

We firmly oppose the notion that government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving.<br><br>Our opponents advocate for government-led rationing as a means to maximize benefits for all. However, we have demonstrated that such intervention infringes upon individual autonomy and personal freedom. Allowing the government to make life-and-death decisions erodes the fundamental right of individuals to make choices about their own health, undermining the doctor-patient relationship that is pivotal to effective care.<br><br>They claim that government rationing ensures equitable access and minimizes discrimination. Yet, history has shown that bureaucratic systems are susceptible to inefficiencies and biases. Rather than eliminating disparities, government control can perpetuate them, leaving vulnerable populations at risk of being overlooked or marginalized.<br><br>Our opponents suggest that rationing fosters innovation by reallocating resources. On the contrary, we have highlighted that innovation thrives in competitive environments where private entities are motivated to improve services and reduce costs. Government rationing stifles this drive, leading to stagnation and decreased quality of care.<br><br>While our opponents emphasize collective well-being, we contend that prioritizing individual choice and market-based solutions effectively address scarcity without sacrificing freedom or quality. By promoting efficiency, reducing waste, and encouraging competition, we can ensure that resources are allocated more equitably and sustainably.<br><br>In this debate, we have upheld the principles of autonomy, equity, and innovation<br><br>**Reference**<br></div>
