                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to tackle a tough question: When healthcare is limited, should the government step in to ration care, essentially deciding whose life is worth saving? Our answer is a firm yes.<br><br>First, let's clarify what we mean. "Health care" includes everything from preventing illness to managing chronic conditions. A "scarce resource" means we don't have enough healthcare services to meet everyone's needs. "Rationing" means carefully distributing these limited resources, potentially delaying or limiting access based on a system of priorities.<br><br>For this debate, we believe the best outcome is one that minimizes discrimination and maximizes overall population health. By focusing on these goals, we can create a system that is both fair and effective when resources are stretched thin.<br><br>Now, let's look at why government intervention is so important. First, government control helps fight discrimination in healthcare when resources are scarce. Without it, unconscious biases related to race, gender, or social status can influence who gets care. A 2017 study in *The Lancet* found that structural racism continues to drive health inequities in the US , underscoring the need for government intervention to ensure equitable access to care. Centralized rationing aims to use objective criteria to minimize this kind of discrimination. We propose using transparent criteria, like age, severity of illness, and likelihood of survival, as starting points for a transparent public conversation, guided by ethical principles and subject to ongoing review, to guide rationing decisions. As highlighted in the *Journal of Ethics* from the American Medical Association, individual bedside rationing can fall prey to deep-seated prejudices about certain kinds of people and even certain kinds of diseases, especially when it comes to affordability . Government intervention can mitigate these biases through standardized protocols.<br><br>Second, the government is more accountable to the public when making these difficult decisions. While any rationing system will be controversial, decisions made by elected officials and government agencies are more open to public scrutiny and can be changed through the democratic process. As one report indicates, from a governmental perspective, public interest is paramount, guiding policies and regulations designed to serve the collective needs of society . This transparency and accountability are crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring that rationing decisions are made in the best interests of the population.<br><br>Third, centralized decisions support medical innovation focused on widespread needs. The *National Institutes of Health* reported that their research, funded at $16 billion a year in 2000, had a rate of return of 25 to 40 percent per year by reducing the economic cost of illness in the US . This ensures that medical advancements benefit the greatest number of people and address the most critical health challenges facing society. The question before us today is not *whether* we will ration healthcare, but *how*. We believe that government intervention, guided by transparent criteria, public accountability, and a commitment to fairness, is the only responsible way to ensure that everyone has a fair chance at life. We urge you to support this approach. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that when healthcare resources are demonstrably scarce, the government should intervene to ration care, thereby deciding whose life is worth saving, based on principles of maximizing overall societal well-being and ensuring equitable distribution. We define "health care" as services provided by healthcare professionals to maintain or improve a person's health; "scarce resource" as a resource for which demand exceeds supply; "rationing" as a process of allocating limited resources in a controlled manner; "government" as the governing body responsible for policies; and "worth saving" as a valuation of life based on potential for future contribution and quality of life. Our judging criteria is utilitarianism: the side that demonstrates the greatest overall good for the greatest number of people should prevail.<br><br>First, government intervention ensures a more equitable allocation of scarce healthcare resources. The Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics highlights the economic rationality of healthcare rationing, noting the scarcity of resources amidst increased demand . Without government oversight, healthcare access is largely determined by socioeconomic status, exacerbating existing inequalities. As the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School notes, resources spent on one patient mean fewer resources for others, necessitating governmental decisions for the common good . Government intervention, through transparent and standardized protocols, aims to distribute these limited resources more justly, addressing the inherent inequities of a market-based healthcare system.<br><br>Second, government rationing maximizes societal benefit by prioritizing those with the highest likelihood of recovery and future contribution. A utilitarian approach dictates that resources should be allocated to achieve the greatest overall good. For example, diverting resources from an elderly, retired population to younger members of society who are more likely to be working can increase economic productivity . Triage protocols, as utilized during crises, prioritize individuals with the highest probability of survival . While ethically challenging, this approach ensures that scarce resources are used to maximize the number of productive life years saved, thus benefiting society as a whole.<br><br>Third, government oversight is crucial in preventing discrimination and bias in healthcare rationing decisions. An article in The Regulatory Review notes that, to maintain public trust, governments should implement processes that protect against bias and other forms of institutional discrimination . Absent government intervention, implicit biases and discriminatory practices can influence resource allocation, leading to unjust outcomes. By establishing clear, objective criteria and monitoring their implementation, the government can mitigate these biases and ensure that rationing decisions are based on medical need and potential for recovery, rather than on factors such as race, socioeconomic status, or other irrelevant considerations.<br><br>In conclusion, we firmly believe that government intervention in healthcare rationing, when resources are scarce, is not only necessary but ethically imperative. By ensuring equitable allocation, maximizing societal benefit, and preventing discrimination, government rationing provides the best framework for navigating the difficult choices inherent in a world of limited healthcare resources.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine being told that your life isn't "worth saving" according to a government algorithm. This is the chilling reality of the opposition's proposal: that when healthcare is a scarce resource, the government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving. We stand firmly opposed to this resolution. While we acknowledge the challenges of resource scarcity, we believe that government intervention in this manner is not the answer. We will demonstrate that this approach devalues human life, harms vulnerable populations, and is susceptible to corruption.<br><br>First, let's address the heart of the matter: the idea that the government should decide "whose life is worth saving." This concept is inherently dangerous. The opposition's definition of "worth saving," based on "potential for future contribution and quality of life," is subjective and discriminatory. How can any government fairly and accurately assess an individual's future potential? Such criteria inevitably lead to the devaluation of individuals based on arbitrary standards. We also reject the utilitarian criteria. While maximizing overall well-being seems appealing, it can easily justify sacrificing the rights and needs of vulnerable minorities for the perceived benefit of the majority. Utilitarianism offers no safeguard against tyranny of the majority and fails to protect the inherent dignity of every human life.<br><br>Second, government rationing of healthcare inherently devalues human life by creating an arbitrary worth based on selected criteria. When healthcare is rationed based on government-defined factors, it inevitably assigns different values to individuals. This leads to ethical concerns and potential discrimination. According to *a 2020 article in PMC*, criteria such as "life-years saved" or "long-term predicted life expectancy," although not referencing age directly, will predictably disadvantage older people relative to younger people. This contradicts the fundamental principle that all human lives have intrinsic value, regardless of their potential or quality of life.<br><br>Third, government-imposed healthcare rationing can disproportionately harm vulnerable populations who lack the resources to navigate complex bureaucratic systems. Marginalized groups, such as the elderly, disabled, and low-income individuals, may face even greater barriers to accessing needed care under a rationing system. These populations often lack the resources and advocacy needed to navigate complex bureaucratic systems, making them particularly vulnerable to being denied essential care. These potential harms of rationing underscore the need for alternative solutions that improve healthcare access and efficiency without sacrificing fundamental ethical principles. Investing in preventative care and telemedicine, for instance, can alleviate resource constraints and improve access for vulnerable populations.<br><br>Finally, we want to address the framing of this debate. The opposition uses emotionally charged language, suggesting that without government intervention, healthcare will be unfairly distributed based solely on socioeconomic status. However, this presents a false choice. Instead of resorting to rationing, we should focus on improving healthcare efficiency and promoting preventative care to alleviate resource constraints. According to *research from PMC in 2020*, a transition from disease treatment to prevention can reduce the incidence of chronic disease and decrease the cost of healthcare.<br><br>For these reasons, we urge you to reject this dangerous proposal that devalues human life and opens the door to discrimination. Let's work towards a healthcare system that prioritizes efficiency, innovation, and the inherent dignity of every individual.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this deb. We shall argue against the proposition that if healthcare is a scarce resource. The government should step into ration. Deciding whose life is worth saving. We contend that such a system is unethical inefficient and ultimately detrimental to the overall well-being of society. Are judging criteria is utilitarianism. The option that provides the greatest good for the greatest number of people should be favored. We will demonstrate that government rationing of healthcare undermines overall well-being due to inefficiencies. Potential discrimination and reduced individual autonomy. And that alternatives provide better care for a larger portion of the population. Government rationing leads to inefficiency in bureaucratic delays. Reducing overall access to healthcare. Government-controlled systems are often plagued by red tape long wait times and inflexible procedures. A study by the fraser institute 1 compared canada's government-run health care system to those of other developed countries and found that canadians waited significantly longer for specialist and diagnostic services. For example in 2021 the median wait time between referral from a general practitioner and receipt of treatment was 25.6 weeks the longest wait time recorded since 1993 these delays not only cause unnecessary suffering but also decrease the chances of successful treatment. This reduces the overall utility. By extending the wait times for procedures and care. Causing pain and suffering that could otherwise be mitigated. Second government rationing creates ethical dilemmas and potential for discrimination. Rationing necessarily involves making difficult choices about who receives care and who does not. This can lead to discrimination against marginalized groups or those deemed less valuable by the rationing body. Resulting in inequitable distribution of health services. A report by the national council on disability 2. Highlighted concerns that rationing decisions. Could disproportionately affect people with disabilities. Who might be perceived as having a lower quality of life or requiring more resources? This is a utilitarian problem. As it reduces the happiness of specific demographics. Based on arbitrary reasoning. Violating the principles of equality and fairness. Such discrimination also undermines the trust between patients and the healthcare system leading to poor health outcomes overall. 3rd market-based alternatives offer greater efficiency and individual choice increasing overall utility. Allowing market forces to play a greater role in healthcare allocation. Can lead to increased competition innovation and responsiveness to individual needs. A study by the galen institute 3. Compare the united states more market-oriented healthcare system with those of european countries with more government control. Finding that the us has greater access to cutting-edge medical technologies. In shorter wait times for certain procedures. Despite challenges with affordability and access for all. Private insurance and out-of-pocket payments allow individuals to prioritize their own health care needs. Leading to a more efficient allocation of resources and higher overall satisfaction. This increases overall utility. As it gives individuals the ability to determine for themselves what healthcare actions they want to take. Empowering them to make choices that align with their values and preferences. In conclusion. Government rationing of healthcare is not only impractical but also morally objectionable. It leads to inefficiencies discrimination and reduced individual autonomy ultimately undermining the well-being of society.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to it. We're here today to demonstrate why government intervention is not just beneficial, but absolutely essential for ensuring fair and equitable healthcare when resources are limited. We'll tackle the concerns raised, and then reinforce why government intervention leads to a more just system for everyone. The question before us today is not *whether* we will ration healthcare, but *how*.<br><br>First, let's reinforce why the government *must* step in. Healthcare resources are, in reality, limited. Without government intervention, access is largely determined by wealth, which creates inherent unfairness. Government involvement ensures a fairer distribution through transparent and consistently applied rules. A 2023 scoping review in *PubMed* found that government-led healthcare rationing can help authorities allocate scarce resources more cost-effectively , freeing up resources for other essential services. Furthermore, we aim to maximize productive life years and ensure resources are used to benefit the greatest number of people. Government oversight also actively prevents biases from influencing critical healthcare decisions.<br><br>Second, let's address this idea of "worth saving." The opposition argues that it's a subjective and discriminatory concept. However, when resources are demonstrably limited, we *have* to make difficult choices. The alternative is to passively allow existing inequalities to dictate who receives care, which is a far more discriminatory outcome. As highlighted in *a 2022 PMC article* about transparency, consistency, inclusiveness and accountability, a transparent and robust guideline for rationing must be established . Imagine a situation where there's a shortage of ventilators during a pandemic. Under our proposed system, a panel of medical experts, ethicists, and community representatives would develop transparent criteria for allocating ventilators based on factors like severity of illness and likelihood of survival. This would ensure that decisions are made fairly and objectively.<br><br>Third, they express concerns about utilitarianism leading to a "tyranny of the majority." While our approach *does* seek the greatest good for the greatest number, we recognize the potential risks. However, allowing the market to control healthcare access poses a significantly greater threat to vulnerable populations. Government intervention, with appropriate safeguards, can ensure fairness and protect those most at risk.<br><br>Fourth, regarding the potential for harming vulnerable populations: their argument assumes that government rationing is inherently unfair. But equitable rationing, with proper oversight, can actually *reduce* existing inequalities. *PMC* published an article in 2023, which stated that the steady growth in High Deductible Health Plans raises concerns about cost-related barriers to care for marginalized populations who tend to not have Health Savings Accounts . The alternative, a market-based system, demonstrably hurts vulnerable populations even more.<br><br>Finally, they claim that government intervention inherently devalues human life. We strongly disagree. The opposition is committing a straw man fallacy by misrepresenting our position. We acknowledge resource limitations, but denying the government's role only perpetuates existing inequalities, effectively rationing care based on socioeconomic status – a far more discriminatory criterion. As *American business magazine Forbes* has found, rationing of healthcare services according to an individual’s ability to pay is becoming more prevalent in the United States . Private systems already ration care; the fundamental question is *how* we do it. We firmly believe that government can and must do it more justly.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments rest on several key misunderstandings and flawed assumptions. We will address their challenges to our definition of "worth saving," their rejection of utilitarianism, their claims about devaluing human life, and their concerns about harming vulnerable populations.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that our definition of "worth saving" is subjective and discriminatory. However, governments *already* make decisions that implicitly value life every day. When allocating budgets for infrastructure , environmental regulations , or public health campaigns , they are, in effect, making choices that impact life expectancy and quality of life. This isn't about a cold, calculated algorithm; it's about transparently and ethically making the best decisions possible with limited resources. Ethicists and healthcare professionals routinely develop and utilize triage protocols  in crisis situations, demonstrating that valuing life based on potential for survival and contribution is not only possible but also necessary.<br><br>Second, they reject utilitarianism, claiming it leads to the "tyranny of the majority." But *any* ethical system requires difficult trade-offs. An ethical framework based on inherent dignity can still result in unjust outcomes and be subject to implicit biases. As research from UC Health indicates , during a pandemic, the primary ethical guideline is to do the greatest medical good for the greatest number of people, while maintaining proper respect for the moral equality of all people. Utilitarianism, when applied with safeguards and careful consideration for vulnerable populations, provides the *most* transparent and accountable framework for making these unavoidable choices. We are not advocating for sacrificing the rights of individuals; we are advocating for a system that maximizes overall well-being while protecting the most vulnerable .<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that government rationing devalues human life. This is simply not true. The current system *already* devalues life based on socioeconomic status. Studies show that without government intervention, access to healthcare is heavily influenced by wealth and income . Rationing, done ethically, seeks to *mitigate* this injustice, not create it. We aim to provide a more equitable allocation of scarce resources, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance at receiving the care they need, regardless of their background. Data from Santa Clara University shows that government intervention ensures a more equitable allocation of scarce healthcare resources .<br><br>Fourth, they argue that government rationing will disproportionately harm vulnerable populations. This is a slippery slope fallacy. They assume that rationing *automatically* leads to discrimination. This is not inevitable. As The Regulatory Review notes, to maintain public trust, governments should implement processes that protect against bias and other forms of institutional discrimination . In fact, vulnerable populations are *already* harmed by the current system. Government rationing, with proper safeguards and oversight, *can* improve their access to care by prioritizing their needs and addressing existing disparities .<br><br>Finally, the opposition presents a false choice: either rationing or improved efficiency and preventative care. These are not mutually exclusive. We can and *should* pursue both. But even with improved efficiency and preventative care, scarcity may still necessitate rationing. The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School says that resources spent on one patient mean fewer resources available for others with medical needs . Healthcare costs continue to rise, and resources will remain limited, making difficult allocation decisions unavoidable.<br><br>Therefore,<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. The opposition's arguments are built on a foundation of misunderstandings. They've argued that utilitarianism is the best way to make tough choices, that their definition of "worth saving" is fair, and that government intervention is the only way to ensure fair allocation. We will address these points directly.<br><br>First, let's dismantle this idea of utilitarianism as the ultimate ethical guide. The opposition claims it's about "the greatest good for the greatest number," but does that justify sacrificing the vulnerable? Does that mean some lives are simply worth less? This approach fails to protect the inherent dignity of every human life. It opens the door to a dangerous calculus where some individuals are deemed expendable for the perceived benefit of the majority. Therefore, their point about utilitarianism misses the mark because it fails to account for the inherent value of every human life, regardless of their potential contribution to society.<br><br>Second, their definition of "worth saving" is just as problematic. They suggest a life's worth should be based on "potential for future contribution and quality of life." But who gets to decide what constitutes a "valuable" contribution? Is it only economic productivity? What about artists, caregivers, or people with disabilities? This is a slippery slope that leads to discrimination and devalues those who don't fit a narrow definition of "worthiness." As stated in *Public Health Ethics: Cases*..., this approach quantifies and judges the value of one life over another, which could disproportionally impact particular population groups . Therefore, their point about "worth saving" is wrong because it opens the door to discrimination and devalues those who don't fit a narrow definition of "worthiness."<br><br>Third, they argue that government intervention is the only way to ensure fair allocation. But does government control guarantee fairness? Can we really trust politicians to make these decisions without bias or corruption? Government control doesn't guarantee equitable distribution; it can be influenced by political factors and biases. Therefore, their point about government intervention is wrong because it fails to account for the potential for bias and corruption in government decision-making.<br><br>As we have discussed, government rationing inherently devalues human life, assigning worth based on arbitrary criteria. This is not a hypothetical concern. It's a real danger that undermines the fundamental principle of equal value for all.<br><br>Furthermore, government rationing disproportionately harms vulnerable populations, like the elderly and disabled. Government rationing, where decisions are made based on an assessment of remaining 'life-years' of the patient, can be seen as a direct violation of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as it subjects older individuals to discrimination based on age.<br><br>Moreover, improving healthcare efficiency and promoting preventative care are much better solutions. As *PMC* reported in *2024*, telemedicine has emerged as a pivotal tool in enhancing geographical accessibility to healthcare, offering significant potential to mitigate health disparities by granting individuals in rural or underserved areas access to essential medical services.<br><br>Now, let's quickly address their attempts to undermine our points. They say governments already make decisions that value life, but those broad budget decisions are different from directly rationing healthcare. They also claim the current system is unfair, but we can fix that without resorting to government control. They insist they can protect vulnerable populations, but their system still opens the door to discrimination. And while they say rationing and prevention aren't mutually exclusive,<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. A steam judges ladies and gentlemen the affirmatives rebuttals fail to address the core issues with their proposal. We will demonstrate that their arguments for government rationing are based on flawed logic. A dangerous ethical framework. And a misunderstanding of the consequences. We will address their defense of the worth saving definition. Their application of utilitarianism. They're downplaying of discrimination and their false dilemma regarding preventive care. First the affirmative equates implicit valuation with explicit rationing. Arguing governments already make decisions that impact life. However this is a false equivalence. Implicit valuation such as investing in infrastructure is an unavoidable consequence of governance one. Explicit rationing involves actively denying care based on predetermined criteria. Giving the government the power to decide whose life is worth saving opens the door to unacceptable ethical violations. The fact that governments make choices that affect lives is not a justification for them to determine a person's overall worth. This is a dangerous slippery slope that we must avoid. The affirmative defends utilitarianism. But this ethical framework offers insufficient safeguards against sacrificing vulnerable minorities. While trade-offs are sometimes necessary. Maximizing overall well-being can easily lead to unjust outcomes. History is replete with examples of utilitarian principles being used to justify discriminatory policies. Such as eugenics programs that targeted individuals deemed unfit for society. A system based on the inherent dignity of all human life. Regardless of their potential contribution provides a stronger and more ethical foundation for health care decisions. Our society should reflect an ideal that ensures care for all as opposed to writing off segments of the population. Third the affirmative claims that rationing mitigates existing inequalities. But in reality it exacerbates them. By codifying them into policy. It's a quick fix that harms more than it helps. Rather than addressing the root causes of unequal access to healthcare the affirmative proposes a system where the government actively decides who receives care and who doesn't. Further marginalizing those already disadvantaged. Studies show that marginalized groups often lack the resources and advocacy needed to navigate complex bureaucratic systems. Making them particularly vulnerable to being denied essential care under a rationing system. Rationing isn't a solution it's a system that deepens existing divides. Fourth the affirmative dismisses our concerns about discrimination as a slippery slope fallacy. However it's not a fallacy but a well-founded concern. The tuskegee syphilis study serves as a stark reminder of how vulnerable populations can be exploited when healthcare decisions are left to the unchecked discretion of authorities. Rationing systems even with safeguards are susceptible implicit biases and is discriminatory practices leading to unjust outcomes for the elderly disabled and low-income individuals. We cannot afford to gamble with the lives of those most in need. Finally the affirmative presents a false choice suggesting that rationing and improved efficiency are not mutually exclusive. While both are desirable. The affirmative avoids the more crucial point. That efficiency and preventive care offer alternatives. To the ethically problematic policy of rationing. Prevention. An increase deficiency decrease the need to consider such morally questionable options. By investing in preventive care telemedicine and streamlined healthcare processes. We can alleviate resource constraints and improve access without resorting to government imposed rationing. For these reasons we urge you to reject the affirmatives proposal.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The central question is whether government involvement in healthcare rationing is ethical and effective. While the opposition paints a grim picture, we contend that without government intervention, healthcare is rationed by socioeconomic status, inherently devaluing lives.<br><br>The opposition challenges utilitarianism, but I maintain that this framework, with careful safeguards, offers the most transparent and accountable way to maximize well-being. They ask how we define "worth saving," but governments already make these choices through budget allocations. The question is how to make them fairly.<br><br>Our stance is that government intervention improves access for vulnerable populations, directly addressing socioeconomic disparities. Safeguards against bias are crucial. The opposition worries about harm to the elderly, but who faces greater risk – someone assessed fairly or someone denied care due to income? As *political scientist Daniel Callahan* argued in *his 1987 book, Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society*, societies implicitly ration healthcare; the key is to make these decisions explicit and just .<br><br>While efficiency and preventative care are important, scarcity persists. Therefore, government oversight is necessary to minimize bias and ensure equitable allocation. As *bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel* noted in *a 2020 article in the New England Journal of Medicine*, a completely free market approach to healthcare would exacerbate existing inequalities .<br><br>Government intervention in healthcare rationing is an ethical imperative, ensuring fairness and promoting the well-being of all, especially the most vulnerable, during times of scarcity.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the ethical allocation of scarce healthcare resources and whether government intervention is the most just approach.<br><br>A central point of contention was the application of utilitarianism. Our opponents argued that it fails to protect the inherent value of every human life . However, we maintain that utilitarianism, when implemented thoughtfully, strives to maximize overall well-being. It does not necessitate sacrificing individuals but rather making the most difficult choices when resources are limited. Any ethical system requires trade-offs. Moreover, the current system already devalues life based on socioeconomic status .<br><br>Another key battleground was the definition of "worth saving." We acknowledge the potential for bias but emphasize that our criteria are not solely based on economic productivity. They also consider factors like potential for recovery and contribution to the community . Our aim is to establish objective criteria to minimize bias, learning from existing triage protocols used in emergencies . We propose transparent decision-making processes, oversight committees, and appeal mechanisms.<br><br>Our opponents suggest that improving healthcare efficiency and promoting preventative care are better solutions. We agree that these are crucial goals. However, resources will always be limited, making difficult allocation decisions unavoidable . Rationing, in our view, is a last resort to be used alongside efforts to improve efficiency and prevention.<br><br>Ultimately, this debate is about justice. We believe in ensuring equitable access to healthcare, even when resources are scarce. True justice requires a system that prioritizes the most vulnerable and ensures everyone has a fair chance at receiving the care they need, regardless of their background .<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, we return to the core of this debate: Should the government decide whose life is "worth saving"? We stand firmly against this inherently flawed, subjective, and discriminatory notion. The opposition's focus on "potential for future contribution and quality of life" devalues individuals based on biased metrics.<br><br>First, the opposition champions utilitarianism. However, this philosophy fails to protect vulnerable populations. Utilitarianism can rationalize sacrificing individual rights for the supposed greater good. We must ask: Are we prepared to embrace a system that deems certain lives less worthy?<br><br>Second, rather than ceding control to the government, we advocate for enhancing healthcare efficiency and expanding preventative care access. This is not a false dilemma. Prioritizing preventative measures and leveraging telemedicine offers a more effective and ethical pathway.<br><br>Third, our opponents argue that government intervention guarantees equitable allocation. However, government control is no panacea; it is vulnerable to biases and corruption. As *political science professor at MIT, Andrea Campbell, noted in her 2023 book, "Trapped in America's Safety Net,"* government rationing, despite purported safeguards, can disproportionately harm vulnerable populations . This demonstrates that even with good intentions, government control can perpetuate inequality.<br><br>We maintain that every human life possesses intrinsic value. A government wielding the power to decide "who is worth saving" wields excessive power. Let us commit to a more just and equitable approach that values every individual. Thank you.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the core question of whether the government should step in to ration healthcare, essentially deciding whose life is worth saving.<br><br>The opposition bases their case on utilitarianism, arguing for the greatest good for the greatest number. However, we demonstrated that this approach fails to protect the inherent dignity of every human life. Utilitarianism can easily be twisted to justify discriminatory practices. As history shows, seemingly logical utilitarian policies have led to negative consequences for minorities and marginalized groups. Therefore, relying solely on utilitarianism poses a real threat to the fundamental principle of equal value for all. <br><br>Furthermore, the opposition's definition of "worth saving," based on "potential for future contribution and quality of life," opens the door to discrimination. It's impossible to accurately predict future contributions or fairly assess "quality of life" without bias.  How can we ensure these criteria don't disproportionately affect disabled individuals, the elderly, or those from marginalized communities? Any attempt to quantify a human life's worth is inherently problematic, making the opposition's definition unacceptable.<br><br>Finally, while the opposition argues that government intervention ensures equitable allocation, we contend that it is susceptible to bias and corruption. Government control doesn't guarantee fairness. We have seen that government intervention can exacerbate existing inequalities. We should not assume that politicians can make life-and-death decisions fairly, without the influence of political factors.<br><br>We believe that all lives have intrinsic value, regardless of age, health status, or potential contribution to society. The opposition's utilitarian framework <br><br>
