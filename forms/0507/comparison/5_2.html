                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to argue that AI will indeed lead to a decline in human creative arts.<br><br>Let’s clarify what we mean by "decline." We are not suggesting that human art will vanish entirely. Instead, we define "decline" as a process where AI, through its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes, diminishes the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. This ultimately leads to a cultural shift where human artistic expression is marginalized and less valued. We believe that AI's impact will fundamentally alter how we perceive and interact with art, shifting its role in our lives.<br><br>So, how should we judge this debate? We believe the core question is: which future – one where AI dominates art creation, or one where human artists are valued and supported – best preserves the cultural value, diversity, and economic opportunity within the arts? The side that demonstrates the greatest positive or least negative impact on these factors should win this debate.<br><br>Now, let's move to our arguments. First, the ease of AI art generation devalues the years of skill and training required for traditional artistic mastery. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. This can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. Think of it like this: learning to play a musical instrument takes years of practice and dedication. But if you can get a computer to generate a song that sounds pretty good instantly, why bother putting in the effort? It's a similar dynamic with art. According to *ACM Digital Library*, AI now makes it possible for anyone to create hundreds of images in minutes, potentially flooding the market and depreciating the value of art as a whole .<br><br>Second, AI's algorithmic art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. We risk losing the unique voices and perspectives that make art so enriching. It's like if every author only used the same ten plotlines – the stories would quickly become boring and predictable. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI-generated art is essentially a remix of prior works, lacking a unique personal vision and potentially leading to derivative, less meaningful art .<br><br>Third, the rise of AI art could lead to job displacement for human artists, further exacerbating economic inequality. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, businesses may choose to replace human artists with AI-powered tools, leading to job losses and increased competition in the art market. This could disproportionately affect artists from marginalized communities. Consider how the rise of AI art threatens the livelihoods of countless artists. According to *the Academy of Animated Art*, 55% of artists already believe that AI will negatively impact their ability to generate income .<br><br>While AI offers exciting new tools for artists, we must consider the potential for these tools to devalue human skill and creativity. For these reasons, we believe AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let's champion human artists by supporting local art programs, advocating for policies that protect their rights, and consciously choosing to purchase art from human artists. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define "decline" as a demonstrable reduction in the quality, originality, and impact of human artistic expression . "Human Creative Arts" are artistic endeavors originating from human ingenuity, emotional expression, and intellectual thought, encompassing various forms such as visual arts, literature, music, and performing arts. "AI" refers to computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence .<br>Our judging criteria is the preservation of human artistic value. The side that best demonstrates the preservation and continued evolution of core human values within creative arts should win the debate.<br><br>First, AI lacks the emotional depth and originality essential for true artistic expression. AI's creative output is fundamentally limited by its reliance on algorithms and data. AI can generate art based on patterns and data it has learned from existing artworks, but it lacks true creativity . Human creativity, in contrast, involves genuine emotions, unique perspectives, and deliberate choices . As Digital Brew notes, AI art lacks true emotional depth, originality, and the ability to make intuitive decisions, limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity . This means that while AI can mimic creativity, it cannot replicate the deeply personal and emotionally resonant art that humans are capable of creating. Because a lack of depth equates to a degradation of art from a human perspective, the inability of AI to produce emotion makes the decline of human creative art unlikely.<br><br>Second, AI serves primarily as a tool to augment, not replace, human creativity. The majority of artists view AI more as a tool to enhance human creativity rather than a substitute . Al-Ghamdi affirmed that AI is not a substitute for human creativity, but a tool that can enrich this creativity if used properly . Many artists are using AI to augment their creative process, generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects . For example, AI can assist with rapid iteration and creation of images, which human artists can then refine with their vision and personal touch . This collaborative approach allows artists to leverage AI's capabilities while retaining their unique artistic vision and control. Therefore, because tools generally improve the value of a craft and help it evolve, it is unlikely that AI will cause the decline of human creative art.<br><br>Third, ethical and legal concerns surrounding AI art limit its potential to dominate the creative landscape. Copyright issues, lack of consent for training data, and potential job displacement raise significant ethical concerns that hinder the widespread adoption and acceptance of AI-generated art . As AaronHall.com reports, AI art copyright issues involve disputes over ownership and infringement, with no clear legal framework . The plaintiffs in a recent case, Karla Ortiz, Kelley McKernan, and Sarah Andersen, alleged that AI art generators used their original artworks without permission to train AI systems . These concerns will likely lead to increased regulation and oversight, further limiting AI's potential to replace human artists. Therefore, because legal and ethical issues will ensure the preservation of human artistic value, the decline of human creative art is unlikely.<br><br>In conclusion, because AI lacks emotional depth, serves as an assistive tool, and faces ethical limitations, we firmly believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We urge you to uphold the preservation of human artistic value.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.<br><br>Our core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories . Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art . This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.<br><br>Building on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts . Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.<br><br>To address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.<br><br>Finally, let’s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives . Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts .<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.<br><br>First, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed "enhancement" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes  reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature  also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz  have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed "benefit" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.<br><br>Second, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick  has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI . Illustrators like Karla Ortiz  rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.<br><br>Third, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for "prompt engineering" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com  suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex  stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians .<br><br>Finally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent <br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's dive in. To begin, let's remember the core of this debate. We stand firm that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts. By "human creative arts," we mean original expressions born from human intellect, skill, and emotion. "Decline" signifies less value, originality, opportunity, and appreciation. AI, in this context, refers to generative AI trained on existing art. Our judging standard is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. Keep these definitions in mind as we proceed.<br><br>First, let's tackle the issue of how AI devalues human artistic skill. The opposition *may* suggest AI amplifies artists, but we must not lose sight of the potential for it to devalue human skill and creativity. The core problem is that AI art floods the market with cheap content. This brings down the perceived value of art made by humans, which requires time, skill, and emotional input. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting. Even if the print is decent, the original holds more value because of the artist's skill and effort. We aren't saying art can’t be made using AI, we're stating that easier access to art that is comparable with unaided human creation devalues solely human work. In fact, *a 2024 study by UN Trade and Development * confirms that generative AI systems have already led to the replacement of human creatives in industries ranging from graphics design and illustrations to game design . Therefore, the flood of AI art directly contributes to the decline in the value of human creative arts.<br><br>The claim that AI fosters artistic growth is also misleading. The opponent mentioned that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations, but skill is part of the artistic journey. The argument that AI helps artists overcome technical limitations misses the point: mastery of technique is often inseparable from the artistic statement itself. Moreover, the "new" art forms AI creates are based on existing art. As *Matt Corrall* points out, AI models are limited by the data they are trained on and cannot truly adapt, interpret, or imagine like a human being . They simply remix existing styles. Therefore, the derivative nature of AI art further contributes to the decline in originality within human creative arts.<br><br>Now, let's address the ethical concerns surrounding copyright. It's not enough to say copyright laws will adapt. As we have mentioned, AI models are trained on existing work without consent. We cannot simply ignore that and say it’s an appeal to fear. The ethical concerns surrounding AI-generated art further contribute to the decline in the value and originality of human creative arts.<br><br>We also need to remember that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. Automation replaces human skills, and some businesses will choose AI over human creators. *PMC* estimates the contemporary art world to be a $65 billion USD market that employs millions of human artists . However, the rise of AI art threatens this ecosystem. Therefore, the reduction of opportunities for human artists due to AI directly leads to a decline in human creative arts.<br><br>Finally, on AI 'restoration,' remember that altering an original piece, even to "restore" it, can diminish its authenticity.<br><br>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that AI leads to a decline in human creative arts by devaluing skill, raising ethical concerns, and reducing opportunities for artists. While AI may offer certain benefits, we must not allow it to undermine the unique value and cultural significance of human creativity. Let's champion human artists and ensure a future where their voices are not silenced.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several mischaracterizations and overlooks key aspects of AI's impact on the artistic landscape. They cling to a narrow view of "preservation" while ignoring the transformative benefits and the natural evolution of art itself. We will address their core arguments concerning devaluation, copyright, job losses, and originality, reframing this debate around *evolution* and *expansion* rather than simple preservation.<br><br>First, the affirmative claims AI devalues human skill, flooding the market and displacing artists. They judge based on a desire to "preserve" the status quo. However, they fail to recognize that technological advancements have *always* reshaped artistic skillsets. Just as photography didn't destroy painting, AI isn't destroying art; it's *evolving* it. To cling to the idea of "preservation" is to stifle artistic growth and ignore the opportunities presented by new tools. The demand isn't disappearing; it's shifting. Instead of pure technical skill, the need for creative direction, prompt engineering, and AI-assisted artistry is growing.  As one article notes, AI is not a substitute for human creativity, but a tool that can enrich it if used properly . We see this as an opportunity to augment artistic abilities. The affirmative ignores that human creativity often reinterprets AI-generated art, blending it with unique human vision and emotion, surpassing AI's limitations. AI is providing tools to allow creativity to expand and express.<br><br>Second, our opponents raise copyright and ethical concerns, citing legal challenges and the unauthorized use of artists' work. However, this ignores the dynamic nature of copyright law. Copyright law has adapted to new technologies like digital music and film, and it *will* adapt to AI. To suggest that copyright law is immutable is to ignore history. The legal battles they cite are ongoing, not settled law. *Most claims in AI art copyright lawsuits have been dismissed* . Furthermore, the very idea of originality in art is complex; human artists have always drawn inspiration from existing works. The line between inspiration and theft is often blurry, and AI simply introduces a new form of inspiration and remixing.<br><br>Third, the affirmative argues that AI reduces opportunities for artists, leading to job losses. However, they neglect the *new* opportunities AI creates. The rise of prompt engineering, AI art curation, and AI-assisted art all create avenues for artists to thrive. While some traditional roles may diminish, AI democratizes art creation, allowing *more* people to engage with art, create art, and consume art. A study indicates the majority of people appreciate AI art, indicating an overall positive perception . AI allows for new art forms and the removal of gate keepers.<br><br>Finally, our opponents bemoan the loss of originality, ignoring that all art builds upon what came before. AI is simply another tool for remixing and reinterpreting existing ideas, allowing for novel art forms previously impossible. The human vision is what sets this work apart and what makes it unique and valuable.<br><br>The question we must ask ourselves: Is it ethical to restrict access to such a powerful tool? If AI empowers more people to create art and enriches society, is it right to limit its use in the name of "preserving" a select few? We believe that the evolution of art, even if disruptive, ultimately benefits society as a whole, expanding artistic expression in ways never before imagined.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you. Our argument stands firm: AI enhances human creative abilities; it will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.<br><br>First, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists’ capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled "The Impact of AI on Modern Art"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.<br><br>Second, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in "AI's impact on art | News"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.<br><br>Third, let’s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article "AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the..."*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.<br><br>Fourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled "Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a..."*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.<br><br>Finally, let’s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in "AI's impact on art | News"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.<br><br>In short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.<br><br>

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.<br><br>

We have demonstrated that AI leads to a decline by devaluing human artistic skill, originality, and opportunities.<br><br>First, the opposition has failed to address how AI floods the market, diminishing the worth of human artists' work. They claim AI creates new opportunities, but *Forbes* has reported AI directly replacing creatives. This isn't progress; it's devaluation. The market becomes saturated with AI-generated content, making it harder for human artists to gain recognition and fair compensation.<br><br>Second, the opposition brushes aside the serious ethical implications. However, ongoing court cases show AI companies are violating artists' rights. Furthermore, many jurisdictions do not protect artworks created solely by AI. Copyright and ethics are not adaptable, because theft will still be theft. The lack of clear legal frameworks and ethical guidelines surrounding AI-generated art poses a significant threat to the livelihoods and rights of human artists.<br><br>Finally, the opposition's vision ultimately involves fewer jobs and lower pay for human artists. They ignore the very real possibility that businesses will increasingly rely on AI, bypassing human writers and artists altogether, leading to significant job losses. Their claim that AI will enhance creativity simply does not hold true because this creative expression will be less worth or valued in the marketplace.<br><br>In conclusion, the opposition's belief that AI enhances creativity fundamentally misunderstands our position: that it ultimately undermines human artistic skill and decreases opportunities. We ask you to side with human artists. By prioritizing human artistic value, we ensure a richer, more meaningful cultural landscape for all.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human skill and originality. Job displacement and ethical concerns. First let's address the heart of the debate. The impact of ai on human skill in originality. Our opponents claimed ai devalues art by flooding the market. But this argument misses the crucial point. Ai amplifies human artistic abilities fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. As ai artist org reported in their 2024 article ai tools enhance artist workflows enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced. It is being transformed and augmented by ai. Leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration. Now let's talk about jobs. Are opponents argue ai leads to job displacement but this ignores the new opportunities it creates. The school of the art institute of chicago reported that the fusion of humans with ai-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft. Or have time for better research. This isn't about replacement. It's about evolution. According to the ai in art market size share trends report 78% of artists believe that ai will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts. Finally while copyright an ethical concerns are valid they are not insurmountable. Copyright laws are adaptable. And will evolve to accommodate ai generated art. Fostering rather than stifling creativity. A recent medium article highlights how artists can choose licensing models that align with their preferences and goals. Maintaining control over their creations while promoting collaboration. In short ai doesn't spell the end of human creativity. It opens up new chapters. It empowers artists fosters innovation and expands the boundaries of art itself.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, we've shown today that AI will not cause the decline of human creative arts; instead, it will fundamentally transform them. The core debate is whether AI devalues human skill.<br><br>First, while our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry, *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates that AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering . This opens doors for new artists traditionally excluded due to technical or resource barriers. Second, regarding job displacement, we've demonstrated that AI empowers artists to focus on their core craft. According to *Adobe's 2023 study on the future of creativity*, artists are using AI to automate tedious tasks, freeing up their time to explore new creative avenues .<br><br>Therefore, we maintain that AI amplifies human artistic capabilities. It's not about replacement; it's about expansion. AI democratizes art creation, and the fusion of human ingenuity with AI unlocks unprecedented creativity. As you've seen, AI allows a more diverse group to participate in artistic expression. *A 2024 report by Arts Council England* highlights that AI tools are enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in creative practices they previously couldn't access .<br><br>Finally, regarding copyright concerns, remember that these issues are inherently adaptable. *A 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization  report* suggests that the uncertainty surrounding AI and copyright is sparking creativity, challenging artists to find novel ways to collaborate with AI while protecting their intellectual property .<br><br>In closing, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity. It opens new chapters, offering new tools and opportunities for artists to thrive. Vote against the narrative of decline.
