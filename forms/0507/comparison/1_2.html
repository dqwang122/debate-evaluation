                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling, a legislative limit on the amount of national debt the U.S. Treasury can incur. We define "abolish" as formally putting an end to the system, practice, or institution of the debt ceiling.<br><br>Our judging criteria is the promotion of economic stability and efficient governance. We contend that the debt ceiling, while intended to promote fiscal responsibility, has repeatedly created economic instability and political gridlock. Abolishing it will lead to a more stable economic environment where the government can reliably meet its obligations and focus on long-term economic growth.<br><br>First, the debt ceiling creates unnecessary economic instability and uncertainty. The debt ceiling has repeatedly led to political standoffs and threats of default, which negatively impact financial markets and the overall economy. For instance, the 2011 debt ceiling crisis led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, resulting in increased borrowing costs for the government and businesses . A report by the Government Accountability Office  found that the 2011 debt ceiling impasse resulted in billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs . Eliminating the debt ceiling would remove this recurring source of instability and prevent future economic damage. According to a CNN article in June 2023, reforms that make future standoffs less risky would be a "positive" from a credit ratings perspective . By removing the debt ceiling, we are actively securing the U.S. credit rating and avoiding needless economic damage.<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling does not effectively control government spending. The debt ceiling is a poor tool for fiscal discipline, as it only addresses the *result* of spending decisions, not the decisions themselves. Congress still has the power to set the budget, and the debt ceiling simply creates a potential crisis when the government needs to pay its bills. The debt ceiling has not achieved its stated goal of imposing fiscal discipline on Congress. The statutory debt ceiling is a completely arbitrary value, there has never been any economic justification for any of its historical values . A New York Times article argues that the debt ceiling has not served a useful purpose in living memory . Congress can implement other fiscal restraints that provide more direct oversight and impact on fiscal policy.<br><br>Third, abolishing the debt ceiling would streamline government operations and reduce political gridlock. The debt ceiling process consumes significant time and resources, diverting attention from more pressing economic issues. It also provides opportunities for political posturing and gridlock, hindering the government's ability to address important challenges. Louise Sheiner, in her testimony to the House Budget Committee, argued that the debt ceiling distracts from real, tangible economic challenges . Freeing Congress from these manufactured crises would allow them to focus on actual economic policies that bolster the economy.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling causes unnecessary economic instability, fails to control government spending, and fosters political gridlock. Abolishing the debt ceiling will promote economic stability, improve government efficiency, and allow policymakers to focus on addressing real economic challenges. For these reasons, we strongly affirm the resolution: Congress should abolish the debt ceiling.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss a critical issue for the U.S. economy: why Congress should abolish the debt ceiling. To ensure clarity, the debt ceiling is the statutory limit on the total amount of money the United States federal government is authorized to borrow to meet its *existing* legal obligations. It’s about paying the bills we've already incurred, not authorizing new spending.<br><br>Our criterion for this debate is straightforward: which side best promotes economic stability and the credibility of the United States on the global stage? We firmly believe that abolishing the debt ceiling is the path that achieves both.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling significantly reduces the risk of a U.S. default and avoids potentially catastrophic economic consequences. The *Government Accountability Office * estimated that the 2011 debt ceiling standoff alone raised borrowing costs by $1.3 billion in that fiscal year . This shows that even the *threat* of default has real, tangible financial repercussions. Think of the debt ceiling like repeatedly threatening to not pay your mortgage after you've already bought the house. It creates unnecessary anxiety and risks foreclosure, even though you have the money to pay. Removing the debt ceiling simply mitigates this risk. It ensures that the U.S. can meet its obligations without causing global panic and market disruption.<br><br>Second, abolishing the debt ceiling aligns congressional actions with previously approved spending, streamlining the budgetary process. It's akin to approving a construction project and then debating whether to actually pay the contractors after the work is completed. This duplication creates unnecessary political gridlock and uncertainty. Removing the debt ceiling streamlines this process, aligning it more closely with the budget approval process. It allows Congress to focus on making sound fiscal policy decisions without the added drama and potential for brinkmanship associated with a potential default.<br><br>Third, removing the debt ceiling reinforces the full faith and credit of the United States, bolstering investor confidence and economic stability. As *Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen* warned in January 2023, failure to meet the government’s obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability . By signaling stability and reducing uncertainty, abolishing the debt ceiling encourages long-term investment, which fuels innovation and job creation, leading to sustained economic growth.<br><br>We anticipate that the opposition will attempt to employ a "straw man" fallacy, claiming that abolishing the debt ceiling equates to supporting unlimited spending. This is a misrepresentation of our position. Abolishing the debt ceiling does not eliminate the need for responsible budgeting.<br><br>For these compelling reasons, we urge you to support efforts to abolish the debt ceiling and ensure a stable and prosperous future for the United States. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that **Congress should not abolish the debt ceiling**. The debt ceiling is defined as a legislative limit on the amount of national debt that the U.S. Treasury can incur, effectively limiting the amount of money the federal government can borrow . It serves as a tool to control government spending and maintain fiscal responsibility.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **fiscal stability and responsibility**. The most desirable outcome is one that ensures long-term fiscal stability, promotes responsible government spending, and avoids economic crises. We contend that maintaining the debt ceiling, while imperfect, is more likely to achieve this stability than abolishing it.<br><br>First, **the debt ceiling acts as a necessary check on excessive government spending**. While it may occasionally lead to political standoffs, the debt ceiling forces Congress to confront the implications of its spending decisions. Economist Veronique de Rugy from the National Review argues that removing the debt ceiling eliminates a major check on government, emphasizing that the federal budget is already in a "horrible mess," and Congress is to blame . The debt ceiling provides a mechanism for oversight and encourages fiscal accountability, which would be lost if it were abolished.<br><br>Second, **abolishing the debt ceiling significantly increases the risk of economic instability**. Multiple sources highlight the potential dangers of removing this fiscal restraint. The Economic Policy Institute  warns that abolishing the debt ceiling could lead to economic recession, financial market disruptions, and higher borrowing costs . The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget  echoes these concerns, stating that removing the debt ceiling could lead to default, higher interest rates, and severe economic downturn . Brookings adds that eliminating the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. Treasuries and trigger a financial crisis . These are not theoretical risks; they are concrete threats to the stability of the U.S. and global economies.<br><br>Third, **viable alternatives exist to improve fiscal responsibility without resorting to abolishing the debt ceiling altogether**. The Government Accountability Office  recommends that Congress consider immediately replacing the current process with an approach that links debt decisions to spending and revenue decisions at the time they are made . The CRFB proposes other alternatives, such as granting the President authority to increase the debt limit if specific fiscal targets are met, or indexing the debt limit to GDP growth . These alternatives offer a more nuanced approach to fiscal management, preserving a degree of oversight and accountability without the drastic consequences of abolishment.<br><br>In conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling poses significant risks to fiscal stability and economic well-being. It removes a necessary check on government spending and increases the likelihood of economic instability. More responsible and effective solutions exist to address the challenges of fiscal management. Therefore, we strongly advocate against abolishing the debt ceiling.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the resolution that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling. While our opponents may argue that this promotes economic stability, we contend it will foster fiscal irresponsibility and long-term economic harm. Let's delve into why maintaining the debt ceiling is crucial for fiscal responsibility.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial check on government spending, potentially leading to uncontrolled debt accumulation. Our opponents might suggest that budget resolutions and spending caps are effective substitutes, but we disagree. The debt ceiling compels Congress to periodically review and authorize further borrowing, providing a vital opportunity to scrutinize spending levels. Removing it eradicates this built-in accountability measure. According to *the Baker Institute*, these measures have proven ineffective, stating that "neither the BCA nor the debt ceiling limit Congress’s ability or will to spend money that is financed with debt." Without the debt ceiling, Congress has a green light to spend without constraint, burdening future generations with unsustainable debt.<br><br>Second, eliminating the debt ceiling *will* erode investor confidence in U.S. debt, potentially increasing borrowing costs. Our opponents might say that the debt ceiling is an outdated mechanism, but we believe it *is* a vital signal of fiscal discipline. As *the World Economic Forum* points out, only a handful of countries employ a debt ceiling to "signal fiscal discipline to their lenders and investors." Removing this signal could be interpreted as a lack of commitment to managing debt responsibly, prompting investors to demand higher returns for lending to the U.S. government. This isn't just about abstract economic theory; higher borrowing costs translate directly into higher interest rates for average Americans – on mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.<br><br>Third, the debt ceiling, despite its flaws, forces Congress to prioritize essential government services over discretionary spending. While our opponents may claim that the debt ceiling leads to political gridlock, we maintain that it is a necessary tool for fiscal prioritization. The need to raise the debt ceiling compels lawmakers to consider which government programs are most critical and ensure they are adequately funded before allocating funds to less essential areas. In 2011, *Republicans in Congress used the debt ceiling as leverage for deficit reduction* because of the lack of Congressional normal order for fiscal year budget votes. While this can lead to political brinkmanship, it also provides a crucial opportunity to reassess spending priorities and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively.<br><br>Now, let's address the opposition's claims directly. They argue that the debt ceiling creates unnecessary economic instability. While it's true that debt ceiling debates can lead to political standoffs, as evidenced by *the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, where the S&P 500 index fell by approximately 17%*, removing it doesn't guarantee smoother fiscal management. It eliminates a critical check on spending, potentially leading to increased debt and economic instability. Political brinkmanship is not solely a result of the debt ceiling; it's inherent in the budgetary process, and removing the debt ceiling won't eliminate it.<br><br>They also argue that the debt ceiling does not effectively control government spending. But, while the debt ceiling may not always be effective, its existence introduces uncertainty that compels negotiation and compromise on spending. The budget process alone is insufficient to control debt because it lacks the immediate and direct pressure of the debt ceiling.<br><br>For these reasons, we strongly oppose the resolution. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition's arguments rest on a flawed premise: that the debt ceiling is a necessary tool for fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that it undermines fiscal responsibility and introduces more problems than it solves. We will address their claims about fiscal responsibility, investor confidence, and prioritization of government services.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that abolishing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial check on government spending, fostering fiscal irresponsibility. However, economic stability is actually a prerequisite for responsible fiscal policy. The debt ceiling undermines this stability, making responsible fiscal planning even more challenging. The Government Accountability Office found that the 2011 debt ceiling crisis resulted in billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs . It’s hard to be fiscally responsible when the debt ceiling needlessly makes things more expensive. Michael Ettlinger from the Economic Policy Institute notes that the debt ceiling is arbitrary and lacks economic justification . The opposition is essentially saying we need the debt ceiling to force fiscal discipline, but as we've shown, the debt ceiling itself makes us less fiscally sound.<br><br>Second, they claim that eliminating the debt ceiling will erode investor confidence in U.S. debt. But the debt ceiling itself is a recurring source of instability that harms investor confidence. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis, which led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, shows that the debt ceiling actually undermines investor confidence . It also causes massive market uncertainty. Francis, an executive at Fitch Ratings, stated that reforms making future standoffs less risky would be a "positive" from a credit ratings perspective . Therefore, abolishing the debt ceiling would increase, not decrease, investor confidence by removing the risk of manufactured crises.<br><br>Third, our opponents argue that the debt ceiling forces Congress to prioritize essential government services. Congress must make spending choices during the budget process with or without the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling only distracts from real economic challenges. As Louise Sheiner testified to the House Budget Committee, the debt ceiling distracts from tangible economic challenges . It does not help to address them. While the negative might claim we want to spend recklessly, this is a strawman. Abolishing the debt ceiling will not eliminate prioritization. It will just mean that we prioritize in a more effective and rational way.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling fails to promote fiscal responsibility, harms investor confidence, and hinders effective prioritization of government services. Abolishing it will promote economic stability, improve government efficiency, and allow policymakers to focus on addressing real economic challenges. For these reasons, we maintain our strong support for the resolution.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Okay, let's get to work. We’re going to show you why abolishing the debt ceiling is the right move for economic stability and efficient governance. First, we maintain that the debt ceiling creates unnecessary economic instability, fails to control government spending effectively, and leads to harmful political gridlock.<br><br>Now, let's directly address our opponents' core argument: that the debt ceiling is crucial for fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that it is, in fact, a tool for fiscal *ir*responsibility that undermines economic stability. They argue it's a vital check on spending, but that's simply not the case. The debt ceiling doesn't force Congress to be more responsible; it creates a potential crisis *after* spending decisions have already been made. It's like locking the barn door after the horses have bolted. The real issue isn't the debt ceiling; it's the lack of responsible budgeting *before* spending is approved. As House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth stated, the debt ceiling has been in effect for 100 years, and it certainly hasn’t constrained the debt in any way; all it’s done is open up opportunities for mischief and brinksmanship . We believe their appeal to fiscal discipline is really an appeal to fear, and we can't let it obscure common sense.<br><br>Furthermore, their claim that removing the debt ceiling will erode investor confidence is unfounded. While our opponents claim removing the debt ceiling will erode investor confidence, countries like Canada and Australia don't have debt ceilings, and still boast high investor confidence because of their strong fiscal management policies. As we've pointed out, the debt ceiling itself creates economic uncertainty, which is what *actually* undermines investor confidence. The brinksmanship that often surrounds debt ceiling impasses can even lead to downgrades of U.S. credit by rating agencies. As *americanactionforum.org* reported, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch have downgraded the United States’ credit rating and directly cited political gridlock *during debt ceiling debates* as one of the reasons why . The debt ceiling doesn't enforce fiscal discipline; it simply delays decisions, often at the cost of economic stability.<br><br>So, if the debt ceiling isn't the answer, what is? The budget process. Our opponents argue it lacks the pressure of the debt ceiling, but that's incorrect. The appropriations process allows for detailed scrutiny of individual spending programs, providing Congress with the opportunity to make informed decisions about where taxpayer dollars are allocated. This is a more transparent and accountable process than the arbitrary debt ceiling, which only addresses the *result* of spending decisions. According to *Bloomberg Government*, the budget resolution sets revenue and spending targets for legislation. Agency officials testify before authorizing and appropriating committees in order to justify budget requests. This offers a preview of the major spending and policy debates .<br><br>Finally, let's remember why we're here: to promote economic stability and efficient governance. Abolishing the debt ceiling does that. It removes a source of unnecessary economic instability, reduces political gridlock, and streamlines government operations. As House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth  has been vocal in support of eliminating the debt ceiling to avoid similar close-call situations, arguing that it creates unnecessary economic uncertainty and distracts from real economic challenges . By removing the debt ceiling, Congress can focus on real economic challenges instead of manufactured crises. That’s why we firmly believe Congress should abolish the debt ceiling.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition attempts to paint a rosy picture of a world without the debt ceiling, but their arguments are based on short-sightedness and a misunderstanding of fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that the debt ceiling, while imperfect, is a crucial tool for maintaining economic stability in the long run. We will address their claims about fiscal responsibility, investor confidence, and prioritization of government services.<br><br>First, the opposition claims the debt ceiling undermines fiscal responsibility and makes things more expensive, citing increased borrowing costs during the 2011 crisis. However, they commit a logical fallacy by focusing solely on the short-term instability caused by debt ceiling debates while ignoring the potential for long-term fiscal irresponsibility. While these debates may cause temporary market jitters, *true* fiscal responsibility requires tools to prevent excessive government spending . As Veronique de Rugy notes in *National Review*, eliminating the debt ceiling removes a major check on government, and "the bottom line is that the federal budget is a horrible mess, and Congress is to blame for it" . We acknowledge the instability caused by the debt ceiling, but the alternative—uncontrolled spending—is equally, if not *more*, unstable in the long run, burdening future generations with unsustainable debt.<br><br>Second, they argue the debt ceiling harms investor confidence, pointing to the 2011 downgrade. But the debt ceiling is a *necessary evil*. While it can lead to short-term market fluctuations, it ultimately signals to investors that the U.S. government is committed to fiscal discipline, even if that commitment is sometimes tested. As the *World Economic Forum* points out, only a handful of countries employ a debt ceiling to "signal fiscal discipline to their lenders and investors," demonstrating its value as a credible commitment . Eliminating this signal could be interpreted as a lack of commitment to managing debt responsibly, undermining long-term investor confidence and potentially leading to higher borrowing costs. Therefore, while there are short-term risks, there are significant long-term benefits to investor confidence with the debt ceiling present.<br><br>Third, our opponents argue that the debt ceiling distracts from real economic challenges, but the debt ceiling *forces* Congress to confront these challenges head-on. Rather than distracting, it creates a moment of reckoning where lawmakers must seriously consider the nation's financial health and make difficult decisions. The claim that abolishing the debt ceiling will automatically lead to more effective and rational prioritization is a fallacy. Without the pressure of the debt ceiling, Congress is likely to continue its pattern of unchecked spending, jeopardizing the nation's economic future. Getting rid of the debt ceiling would eliminate a major check on the government . A breach of the debt limit would mean stopping payments to programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, child nutrition programs, and others . As such, it is critical to prioritize and consider the essential needs of our citizens.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling fosters fiscal prioritization and is a necessary evil that promotes fiscal discipline and ultimately increases investor confidence. Abolishing it carries significant risks, including economic recession, financial market disruptions, and increased borrowing costs . We stand firm in our opposition to abolishing the debt ceiling.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Are opponents advocate abolishing the debt ceiling. But their arguments disregard a fundamental principle. Fiscal responsibility is paramount. While they claim the debt ceiling is problematic. We maintain its a vital mechanism for ensuring a stable economic future. It's not about lacking knowledge. It's about choosing to ignore the importance of this fiscal safeguard. First let's reinforce why the debt ceiling is crucial for fiscal responsibility. As we've stated it forces congress to periodically review borrowing and spending habits. Eliminating it removes a key accountability measure. The opposition suggests that budget resolutions are sufficient but these are often ineffective. Without the debt ceiling congress can spend without constraint. Potentially burdening future generations with debt. The debt ceiling also signals fiscal discipline to investors removing it could erode investor confidence and potentially increase borrowing costs. Leading to higher interest rates. It compels lawmakers to prioritize programs ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effectively. It's a mechanism that makes our elected officials think twice before committing to spending. That we as taxpayers will ultimately have to cover. Let's consider whether removing the debt ceiling guarantees smoother fiscal management. It's simply removes a check on spending. While the opposition focuses on temporary disruptions caused by debt ceiling debates these are manageable. The potential for fiscal mismanagement without the debt ceiling is far more concerning. It's a guardrail preventing drastic debt increases. As we have discussed. The debt ceiling raise forces accountability and makes lawmakers face the consequences of their spending decisions. It's not a perfect system but it's a necessary one to prevent unchecked spending. Third the debt ceiling introduces uncertainty that compels negotiation and compromise. The threat of hitting the ceiling forces both parties to negotiate. Potentially leading to spending cuts or fiscal reforms that might not otherwise occur. Removing the debt ceiling eliminates this pressure point. Making it easier to increase spending without considering the long-term consequences the opposition implies congress will simply cut spending responsibly. Through the normal budget process. However according to a report titled reforming the appropriations process. Those who desire to constrain spending do not enjoy the leverage generally conferred on coalitions built to protect the status quo. Therefore as highlighted in the report the appropriations process is truly stacked against fiscal hawks. The debt ceiling while sometimes disruptive. Creates leverage for those advocating fiscal restraint. Finally regarding the claim that the debt ceiling undermines economic stability. It's true that debt ceiling debates can cause uncertainty. However that uncertainty is a symptom of political polarization. Not a reason to eliminate a key fiscal tool. Markets have historically priced in these debates. Removing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial leverage point. For fiscal conservatives. To negotiate spending cuts and control government expansion. In fact as mentioned in a report titled the debt ceiling will be reinstated on january 1. Two of the three major credit rating agencies standard & poor's and fitch have downgraded the nation's credit rating. And i've cited brinkmanship over the debt ce. As one of the major factors. Along with a concern about the size of the mounting debt. Furthermore according to the british journal of political science. Political support for brinkmanship in this context is partially a product of voter ignorance. The debt ceiling is a tool that can be used to force negotiation and bring attention to the consequences of unchecked spending. It's not about creating chaos it's about forcing accountability.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the economic stability, fiscal responsibility, and government efficiency related to the debt ceiling.<br><br>The core clash centers on whether the debt ceiling promotes or undermines economic stability and investor confidence. Our opponents suggest it signals fiscal discipline, but we've demonstrated it's a recurring source of instability. The 2011 downgrade and Fitch's statement  prove reforms reducing standoffs are viewed positively. The debt ceiling causes brinkmanship, which harms the economy. By removing this risk, we increase investor confidence, since it removes a *source* of instability rather than attempting to manage the symptoms. The idea that investors value the *potential* for crisis over *actual* stability is simply irrational.<br><br>Next, we must consider fiscal responsibility and government spending. Our opponents believe the debt ceiling is the only thing preventing reckless spending. This is false. The debt ceiling addresses the *result* of spending, not the cause. Budget processes, while imperfect, are a more direct means of control. As Michael Ettlinger from the Economic Policy Institute notes, the debt ceiling is arbitrary . We aren't advocating for reckless spending, just a more rational process. Moreover, the negative has stated that those who want to constrain spending do not enjoy the leverage conferred on coalitions built to protect the status quo. However, these processes are already in place and do not require additional confusion.<br><br>Finally, consider political gridlock and government efficiency. The debt ceiling leads to artificial and damaging gridlock. As Louise Sheiner testified , it distracts from real economic challenges and prevents addressing important issues. The debt ceiling debates are manufactured crises serving political purposes rather than promoting good governance.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The central question in this debate is how we achieve a stable economy and an efficient government. We've demonstrated that the debt ceiling actively undermines these goals, rather than protecting them.<br><br>Our opponents argue the debt ceiling keeps spending in check, but it's actually a source of economic chaos. Consider that, as *reported by Reuters in 2011*, the U.S. credit rating was downgraded due to political games surrounding the debt ceiling . Eliminating it removes a recurring threat, which, contrary to our opponents' claims, will boost investor confidence. It's about removing an obstacle to economic growth.<br><br>They also claim it controls spending, but it only addresses the *symptoms*, not the *causes*, of our financial issues. True fiscal responsibility requires economic stability. The debt ceiling distracts from the real economic problems we face. As taxpayers, you feel the impact when these artificial crises drive up borrowing costs. This is money that could be used for important programs and investments.<br><br>Finally, consider the political gridlock it creates. The debt ceiling process wastes valuable time and resources. Without it, Congress can focus on real economic policies that benefit everyone. It allows for a more focused and productive government.<br><br>In conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling leads to a more stable economy, reduces political infighting, and allows for a government that works efficiently. By removing this unnecessary obstacle, we pave the way for sustainable growth and prosperity. Vote for a future where our government can reliably meet its obligations and focus on long-term economic growth. Vote to abolish the debt ceiling.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around fiscal responsibility and economic stability. Hinging on the central question of whether congress should abolish the debt ceiling. Our opponents argue that abolishing the debt ceiling promotes economic stability. But in reality it eliminates a crucial check on government spending. Without the debt ceiling congress can spend without constraint. Potentially burdening future generations with unsustainable debt. The opposition suggests budget resolutions are sufficient. But the baker institute states that these measures have proven ineffective. They also argue that the debt ceiling increases borrowing costs and is arbitrary. However the government accountability office report they cite doesn't explicitly state that the debt ceiling caused increased borrowing costs in 2011. Other factors were involved. Well not perfect alternative mechanisms are even less effective. Furthermore the debt ceiling signals fiscal discipline to investors. Removing it could a road investor confidence and potentially increase borrowing costs. Are opponents claim the debt ceiling itself causes instability. Pointing to the 2011 downgrade. However that downgrade was due to broader concerns about us debt. The world economic forum points out that only a handful of countries employ a debt ce. Because it provides a valuable signal of fiscal discipline. To lenders and investors too. The debt ceiling introduces uncertainty. That compels negotiation and compromise. Potentially leading to spending cuts or fiscal reforms. Removing it eliminates this pressure point. Our opponents imply congress will simply cut spending responsibly. Through the normal budget process. However a report titled reforming the appropriations process highlights how the appropriations process is stacked against fiscal hawks.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, at the heart of this debate is a fundamental question: do we prioritize short-term political convenience, or the long-term fiscal health of our nation? Our opponents portray the debt ceiling as a disruptive force, but in reality, it is a vital mechanism for fiscal discipline. Eliminating it would essentially give Congress a blank check, endangering the financial security of future generations.<br><br>First, while our opponents claim the debt ceiling undermines economic stability, the potential for fiscal mismanagement *without* it poses a far greater danger. Think of it as the difference between navigating a challenging turn and removing the steering wheel altogether. The debt ceiling *compels* crucial fiscal debates.<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling provides a critical signal of fiscal discipline to investors worldwide. Removing this signal risks eroding investor confidence, potentially leading to increased borrowing costs for all Americans. This is not a risk we can afford to take.<br><br>Third, the debt ceiling, despite leading to occasional debates, is ultimately a stabilizing force. It compels negotiation and fiscal restraint. Without it, we risk unchecked spending and long-term economic instability.<br><br>Finally, the debt ceiling forces Congress to make difficult but necessary decisions about spending priorities, ensuring essential services are not neglected. The standard budget process alone cannot guarantee this level of prioritization. The debt ceiling ensures that these priorities are addressed and debated.<br><br>In conclusion, the choice before you is clear. Maintaining the debt ceiling is essential to safeguard fiscal responsibility and ensure a stable economic future for all Americans. I urge you to vote in favor of fiscal prudence and against unchecked spending. Thank you.
