                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank .<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.<br><br>First, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households . Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs . By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible . This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers . A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.<br><br>Second, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions . Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems . A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world’s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership . A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument . The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership . By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.<br><br>Third, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities . CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing . CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts . Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.<br><br>In conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We're here today to discuss a pivotal question shaping the future of American finance: Should the United States implement a central bank digital currency? To be clear, when we advocate for a CBDC, we propose that the Federal Reserve develop and implement a digital form of U.S. currency, accessible to all residents and businesses. This CBDC would complement existing payment methods like cash and debit cards, operating under established financial privacy laws. Our goal is to boost payment efficiency, enhance financial inclusion, and ensure the dollar's continued international prominence.<br><br>The central question in this debate is: Which approach best expands economic opportunity for all Americans while ensuring the U.S. remains a leader in the evolving global financial landscape?<br><br>With that framework in mind, let's examine why a CBDC is a strategic imperative for the United States. First, a CBDC significantly promotes financial inclusion by extending access to digital payments for those currently excluded from the traditional banking system. According to the *Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation *, their most recent survey found that in 2021, 4.5% of U.S. households, representing 5.9 million families, were unbanked . A CBDC offers a government-backed digital alternative, functioning as a basic digital wallet, thereby enabling full participation in the modern economy. Furthermore, the *FDIC* also noted a significant increase in smartphone access among unbanked households, with access doubling between 2013 and 2023, reaching 72.1% . This widespread access to technology makes a CBDC a viable solution for reaching those currently excluded from the traditional banking system. Imagine a single mother being able to receive child tax credit payments instantly and without fees, directly to her phone.<br><br>Second, a central bank digital currency demonstrably reduces transaction costs, particularly benefiting small businesses. Small businesses currently face average credit card processing fees ranging from 1.5% to 3.5% per transaction, as reported by multiple sources . A CBDC streamlines transactions by reducing reliance on traditional banking systems and eliminating intermediaries, thereby lowering fees and enhancing efficiency. Think of a local bakery being able to accept payments directly from customers without paying a cut to credit card companies. This directness translates to tangible savings for businesses, fostering growth and competitiveness.<br><br>Finally, the U.S. must embrace CBDC innovation to maintain its global financial leadership. Other nations are actively developing CBDCs, and the *Central Bank Digital Currency Tracker* emphasizes that the absence of U.S. leadership in setting international standards could have geopolitical consequences . A U.S. CBDC can help maintain the leading role of the U.S. dollar in the world financial system. As *the Federal Reserve* has noted, as foreign monetary unions and countries like China introduce their own CBDCs, demand for U.S. dollars abroad may fall . By proactively developing a CBDC, the U.S. can shape the future of digital finance, ensuring the dollar remains a dominant force in international trade and finance. To illustrate, a highly interoperable U.S. CBDC could strengthen the dollar's standing as a medium of exchange, according to the report *Implications of a U.S. CBDC for International Payments and the Role of the Dollar* . The U.S. must address key issues such as interoperability, data privacy, and security to shape international standards for CBDCs.<br><br>In conclusion, a CBDC is a vital step toward a more inclusive, efficient, and competitive financial future for the United States.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency . A CBDC is defined as a digital form of central bank-issued money, distinct from commercial bank money and physical cash, that serves as legal tender and a direct liability of the central bank . We believe the judging criteria for this debate should be based on which side best promotes financial stability and protects individual liberties.<br><br>First, CBDCs pose a significant threat to individual financial privacy and liberty. The Cato Institute highlights that CBDCs threaten Americans’ financial independence, as the government would be able to surveil the uses of a centralized digital currency . This surveillance capability enables the government to monitor citizens' spending habits, potentially chilling dissent and enabling discriminatory practices. The Republican Policy Committee points out the danger of CBDCs, emphasizing the potential loss of financial independence and increased government control . Considering that funds will flow within the system, with money being sent from a commercial bank through a Fed account to its ultimate recipient , CBDCs introduce significant privacy risks and are fundamentally the antithesis of American values .<br><br>Second, CBDCs create systemic cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities. ScienceDirect indicates that CBDC, as a digital form of fiat currency, is subject to cybersecurity issues, which could pose risks to the entire financial system . Any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of the entire financial system . Centralizing financial data in a single, government-controlled system makes it a prime target for cyberattacks, potentially leading to widespread economic disruption and loss of assets. The Bank for International Settlements  points out that a key risk involves potential gaps in central banks' internal capabilities and skills to safeguard against evolving cyber threats .<br><br>Third, CBDCs undermine the existing commercial banking system and access to credit. McKinsey & Company warns that CBDCs may reduce commercial bank revenues through deposit substitution and lower transaction fees . This could lead to banks facing funding challenges if CBDCs replace deposits, impacting their liquidity and reserves . The Independent Community Bankers of America  argues that a U.S. CBDC would obstruct the ability of banks to take deposits and make loans . If banks are disintermediated, their ability to lend is reduced, potentially leading to credit crunches and economic slowdown.<br><br>In conclusion, the implementation of a CBDC in the United States poses significant risks to individual privacy, cybersecurity, and the stability of the financial system. For these reasons, we strongly oppose the adoption of a central bank digital currency.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.<br><br>However, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.<br><br>First, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money . This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.<br><br>Second, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks . The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America’s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated . Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.<br><br>Third, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC .<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.<br><br>First, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy . However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data . Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy . Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities . Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy—something a CBDC is designed to promote—is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism .<br><br>Second, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks . However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design . DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security . This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 . Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing . Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.<br><br>Third, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers . While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems . The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion . Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role . The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.<br><br>In conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We firmly advocate for implementing a US CBDC because it's a crucial upgrade for our financial system in this digital age. It's about ensuring no one is left behind and that the U.S. remains a leader in the global economy.<br><br>First, let's underscore how a CBDC dramatically expands financial inclusion. The *2023 FDIC National Survey of Unbanked and Underbanked Households* shows that a significant 14.2 percent of U.S. households, about 19 million, are underbanked . A CBDC provides these individuals with a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative to traditional banking. It's like building a digital on-ramp, granting access to the financial system for those historically excluded. This reduces barriers and lowers transaction costs, fostering competition and ultimately reducing the cost of financial services for everyone.<br><br>Second, a CBDC significantly boosts payment system efficiency and our international competitiveness. Current systems are often slow and costly due to intermediaries. *A 2022 Fed report* highlights that a CBDC could support faster and cheaper payments, including cross-border transactions . The *U.S. Department of the Treasury* has also emphasized the need for the United States to collaborate with international partners on digital payment standards to reduce inefficiencies and ensure alignment with U.S. values and legal requirements . This is not just about convenience; it's about maintaining the dollar's global status as other countries actively explore and implement CBDCs.<br><br>Third, a CBDC plays a crucial role in curbing illicit activities. Currently, cash is often favored for illegal transactions due to its anonymity. A CBDC, with its inherent traceability, acts as a deterrent to money laundering and terrorist financing. It's like adding a digital paper trail to every transaction, making it harder for criminals to hide their activities.<br><br>Now, let's address the privacy concerns. The opposition suggests a CBDC enables government monitoring. However, this already exists with current digital payment systems! We can implement specific data anonymization techniques, such as masking and aggregation, to protect user identities. We can also establish strict limits on data retention, with automatic deletion after a set period, and create independent oversight mechanisms, like a privacy review board, to ensure compliance.<br><br>Regarding the potential for abuse of power, the central bank can be subject to rigorous oversight and checks and balances to ensure accountability. Moreover, we can design the CBDC with limited traceability, focusing on detecting and preventing illicit activities while safeguarding legitimate users' privacy.<br><br>Finally, concerning cyberattacks, the central bank is arguably better equipped to defend against systemic risks than private entities due to its resources and expertise. We can implement security measures such as multi-factor authentication, encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. Furthermore, the development costs associated with a CBDC should be viewed as an investment in modernizing our financial infrastructure, ultimately leading to a more resilient and efficient economy.<br><br>In conclusion, the benefits of a CBDC far outweigh the potential risks, especially when those risks are proactively addressed through careful design and regulation. We must embrace this innovation to build a stronger, more inclusive, and more competitive economy for all Americans.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. Esteem judges ladies and gentlemen the affirmatives rebuttals fail to adequately address the core concerns surrounding a us cbdc. They attempt to assuage our concerns about privacy cybersecurity and costs but their arguments are ultimately unconvincing. First let's address the judging criteria. The affirmative insists on maximizing economic stability and growth as the sole measure of success. We argue that this is a dangerously narrow view as the risks of central bank digital currency in the united states. The implementation of central bank digital currencies as the primary medium of exchange would exacerbate the flaws of our current fiat system. True progress isn't just about boosting gdp. It's about safeguarding fundamental rights. Even if a cbdc offers a marginal economic benefit. The potential cost to individual liberty and financial freedom outweighs any supposed gain. History is replete with examples where prioritizing economic growth at all costs led to authoritarianism and societal harm. Are we willing to sacrifice our freedom on the altar of economic efficiency. Second the affirmative claims that privacy by design will eliminate our concerns about government surveillance. This is simply not realistic. As studies mentioned privacy concerns for central bank digital currency in the us including mass surveillance. Cybersecurity risks and potential data misuse. While privacy protection is a key design feature being considered. The promise of secure data handling doesn't erase the inherent risk of centralized data collection. As cited in the risks of central bank digital currency in the united states a cbdc does not offer any unique benefit to the american people. But it does post serious risks to financial privacy freedom markets and cybersecurity. Data breaches occur even with the most sophisticated security measures. Furthermore we reject the argument that because current digital payment systems possess tracking capabilities. We should accept more traceability in the hands of the government. That's like saying because petty theft exists we should legalize grand larceny. The government's ability to monitor every transaction. Create a chilling effect on free expression and opens the door to potential abuse. Third the affirmative touts the security of decentralized ledger technology as a solution to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While dlt offers potential benefits it's not a silver bullet. And security risks include data breaches fraud and attacks on central bank digital currency systems 5. Excited by the source above these systems must be safeguarded against evolving threats and quantum computing poses a new risk to encryption and central banks face security challenges in deploying cbdc. Successful attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and other dlt based systems. Demonstrate that these technologies are not immune to hacking. Moreover the affirmative ignores the fact that traditional financial systems have benefited from decades of security investments and hardening. A nascent dlt based cbdc would lack this crucial foundation. Making it a prime target for cyber criminals. Finally the affirmative points to the successful implementation of cbdcs in the bahamas jamaica and nigeria. As evidence of their viability. With all due respect. These are vastly different economic contexts in the united states. What works in a small island nation with limited financial infrastructure may not scale effectively or safely? In a complex technologically advanced economy like ours. As the bank policy institute points out there are currently no reliable estimates of the true cost of developing and implementing a us cbdc. The alternative to central bank digital currency in the us include stable coins and intermediated cbdc models.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate our opponents' arguments, but we believe they miss the forest for the trees. We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.<br><br>First, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society’s most vulnerable.<br><br>You tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.<br><br>Second, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.<br><br>Third, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.<br><br>Now, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.<br><br>Finally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.<br><br>In conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. From the very outset of this vital debate. We have meticulously and rigorously address the fundamental and inextricably linked core concerns. Those specifically surrounding the sacrosanct realm of individual privacy. The paramount imperative of comprehensive security. And the multifaceted undeniably far-reaching economic implications. All inherently associated with the thoroughly considered. Thoughtfully deliberated and ethically sound implementation of a carefully crafted central bank digital currency within the constantly evolving and increasingly complex financial ecosystem of the united states of america. Our respected and undoubtedly well-intentioned opponents have. With understandable prudence and commendable caution. Voice specific and readily acknowledged concerns that a cbdc may whether intentionally or through unintended consequences inadvertently compromise the deeply cherish. And fundamentally protected right to individual privacy. Thereby raising the specter of potential and decidedly unwarranted government surveillance over the private financial lives of ordinary citizens. However. Throughout the course of this debate. We have presented compelling robust and demonstrably convincing evidence that cbdcs. When intelligently and ethically designed from their very inception? With robust correct multi-layer. Proactively implemented. Rigorously and independently tested. And continuously monitored privacy by design principles 2. Can effectively grant users meaningful verifiable and legally enforceable control over their own personal financial data. While simultaneously ensuring essential and responsible traceability. Strictly for legitimate narrowly defined and judicially authorized purposes. Such is the prevention of money laundering. The combating of terrorism and the investigation of serious financial crimes.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, we've shown how a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and security. Our opponents have concentrated on privacy, cybersecurity, and cost. However, the core issue is balance.<br><br>First, let’s tackle privacy. We agree it's crucial. However, design and regulations can ensure confidentiality. *The Brookings Institution noted in 2023* that a CBDC can incorporate privacy-enhancing technologies . Existing digital systems already track financial transactions. A CBDC, with proper safeguards, doesn't fundamentally  alter this landscape.<br><br>Second, regarding cybersecurity, our opponents worry about single points of failure. However, this ignores decentralized designs. *A 2022 Atlantic Council report* indicates that CBDCs can use distributed ledger technology to boost security and resilience . Our cybersecurity plans adapt to counter emerging threats. We are not static; we continuously evolve our defenses.<br><br>Finally, let's consider cost. The opponents overstate implementation costs. Long-term, a CBDC is more affordable than maintaining older systems. *A 2023 study by the Digital Dollar Project* suggests that a CBDC's long-term operational costs could be lower than existing payment systems due to increased efficiency and reduced fraud .<br><br>This debate presents two paths: economic expansion and stability that promote freedom, or stagnation rooted in fear. Our vision promotes both liberty and security. The choice is clear. A CBDC is vital for a thriving, secure future. Vote for progress. Support a US CBDC!

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the privacy implications, cybersecurity risks, and economic costs associated with a U.S. central bank digital currency.<br><br>The core battleground of this debate is **privacy**. Our opponents suggest a CBDC can be designed with privacy in mind, but this overlooks the fundamental issue. A CBDC inherently concentrates power, creating a system ripe for potential abuse . Regulations are insufficient to guarantee privacy, as they can be altered or circumvented . Even if data is anonymized, it can still be re-identified through metadata analysis . While existing digital systems track transactions, a CBDC amplifies this surveillance, creating a permanent record of every financial activity. This could have a chilling effect on free speech and association .<br><br>Another key battleground is **cybersecurity**. The affirmative touts decentralized ledger technology, but this does not eliminate the risk of a single point of failure . Centralizing all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, leading to widespread economic disruption . Diversifying across many financial institutions, as we do now, provides a more resilient and secure financial system .<br><br>Finally, the debate centers on **cost**. The affirmative suggests long-term savings will outweigh initial investments, but this remains unproven. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency . These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers.<br><br>In conclusion, the implementation of a U.S. CBDC poses significant risks to individual privacy, financial security, and economic stability. We urge you to oppose its adoption.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, this debate boils down to a fundamental choice: are we willing to trade our freedom for the illusion of economic efficiency? Our opponents propose a convenient financial system, but we contend that it demands an unacceptable sacrifice of privacy and liberty.<br><br>First, consider surveillance. While the opposition suggests CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, this is fundamentally  flawed. A CBDC concentrates unprecedented power, centralizing all financial data and making it easily accessible to government entities. As *the American Civil Liberties Union* clearly stated, "the risk of government surveillance and control over our financial lives is simply too great" . Regulations are insufficient because they can be easily altered.<br><br>Second, the cybersecurity risk is undeniable. The opposition mentioned decentralized ledger technology, but this does not eliminate the core risk. A centralized CBDC creates a massive target for hackers. According to *a 2022 report by the cybersecurity firm FireEye*, "centralized financial systems are prime targets for sophisticated cyberattacks" . A successful attack would disrupt the entire economy.<br><br>Finally, let’s not forget the cost to taxpayers. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management will be borne by the public, with no guarantee of any real benefits.<br><br>In closing, remember that economic stability is not the only consideration. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. A US CBDC is a step too far. Do not let the promise of efficiency blind you to the dangers of unchecked government power. We strongly urge you to oppose the implementation of a CBDC.
