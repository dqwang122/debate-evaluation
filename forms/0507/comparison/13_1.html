                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss whether pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. To ensure clarity, "young adults" refers to individuals aged 18 to 25 from all socioeconomic backgrounds. "Beneficial" means providing significant advantages in career opportunities, financial stability, personal growth, and social mobility, while acknowledging the challenges of student debt. "Today's society" encompasses our current economic, technological, and social environment. And finally, a "four-year college degree" signifies a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution.<br><br>Now, let’s move on to why we firmly believe a four-year college degree is indeed beneficial. I will present three key arguments supporting this stance.<br><br>First, a college degree significantly boosts lifetime earnings, leading to greater financial security. It's not just about getting a job; it's about building a financially secure future. According to the *Social Security Administration*, men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates, and women with bachelor's degrees earn $630,000 more . This increased earning potential acts as a substantial buffer against economic hardship. Higher earnings translate to more opportunities for homeownership, investments, and a comfortable retirement. It provides a safety net during unexpected financial challenges. Therefore, a college degree is a tangible investment in long-term financial well-being.<br><br>Second, college graduates are better equipped to adapt to changing job market demands through continuous learning and skill development. The job market today is rapidly evolving, with new technologies and industries emerging constantly. College provides a solid foundation for continuous learning. It equips graduates with critical thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling them to navigate career transitions and remain competitive. As highlighted in research from *PMC*, students make substantial gains in critical thinking during college . The critical thinking skills developed in college, such as problem-solving and analytical reasoning, enable graduates to adapt to new technologies and industries, remaining competitive in a rapidly changing job market. Furthermore, *the Journal for Labour Market Research* indicates that university graduates earn, on average, up to CHF 20,000 more per year than those with professional education degrees, highlighting the long-term wage advantage conferred by a broader academic skillset . Therefore, a college education is an investment in your long-term professional success.<br><br>Third, college promotes a more inclusive and equitable society by providing opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds. Higher education can help level the playing field and create a more just and equitable society by providing access to opportunities for all. College fosters diversity and inclusivity, exposing students to different perspectives and promoting social mobility.<br><br>In conclusion, a four-year college degree remains a valuable investment for young adults in today's society. It leads to greater financial security, equips graduates with the skills to adapt to the changing job market, and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society. Let's continue to support policies that make college accessible and affordable for all young adults. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. We define a **four-year college degree** as the successful completion of a program of study at an accredited higher education institution, typically resulting in a Bachelor's degree. **Beneficial** is defined as producing favorable or advantageous results; contributing to improvement or well-being. And **young adults** are individuals typically between the ages of 18 and 25.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **Societal Advancement**. You should prioritize the side that demonstrates the greatest contribution to the overall advancement and well-being of society. This encompasses economic, social, and personal benefits.<br><br>First, a four-year college degree leads to **enhanced economic opportunity**. A college degree significantly increases earning potential and job security for young adults in today's competitive job market. Bachelor’s degree holders earn 68% more than those with only a high school diploma . The earnings gap between college graduates and those without continues to widen . Median lifetime earnings are $1.2 million higher for bachelor’s degree holders . This isn't just about individual wealth; it strengthens the economy. Moreover, college graduates are half as likely to be unemployed as their peers whose highest degree is a high school diploma . This economic stability translates to a more productive workforce and a stronger tax base, contributing to overall societal well-being. Research consistently demonstrates that a college education is a sound investment in one's future and a catalyst for economic growth. A more educated populace contributes to a stronger economy and improved societal well-being.<br><br>Second, college fosters the **development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills.** College education shows potential employers you can complete a long-term project, you can think critically, solve problems, and have the capacity to learn . Critical thinking encourages innovative and outside-the-box problem-solving approaches . By considering multiple angles and challenging conventional ideas, critical thinkers arrive at inventive solutions to complex challenges . Graduates enter the world better equipped to evaluate evidence, challenge biases, and contribute positively to society . In a world grappling with complex challenges, from climate change to economic inequality, the ability to analyze information, identify problems, and develop effective solutions is paramount. A college education cultivates these essential cognitive abilities, preparing individuals to be informed and engaged citizens who can contribute meaningfully to solving the pressing issues of our time. These skills are necessary for societal advancement.<br><br>Third, a college degree promotes **increased civic engagement and social mobility.** College graduates are more likely to participate in civic activities, contribute to their communities, and experience upward social mobility, strengthening the fabric of society. People with a bachelor’s degree earn more money than those without – $765,000 more on average in their lifetime . A study from 2022 found that young people who have social capital with people from different economic statuses are more likely to achieve increased social mobility . Individuals with a college degree are more likely to vote and volunteer in their communities, have higher levels of wellbeing and better access to . College graduation decreases welfare use, lowers depression, and raises self-esteem more for low-ability individuals than high-ability . By providing access to knowledge, networks, and opportunities, a college education empowers individuals to climb the socioeconomic ladder,<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss whether pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. While my opponents will likely highlight the advantages, we contend that the reality is far more complex and, for many, a four-year degree is no longer the golden ticket it once was.<br><br>First, let's clarify a few key terms. We acknowledge the common understanding of "young adults" and "four-year college degree." However, the term "beneficial" requires a more nuanced approach. We must consider the crushing weight of student loan debt that many graduates now carry. Also, when we consider "today's society," we must recognize the rapid pace of technological advancement and the evolving demands of the job market. These factors significantly alter the equation and challenge the traditional notion of a college degree as universally beneficial.<br><br>Now, let's address the elephant in the room: student loan debt. My opponents might tout increased lifetime earnings, but they often downplay the crippling effect of student loans. According to *Federal Student Aid, the office within the Department of Education* responsible for managing federal student loans, the average student loan debt was $38,375 at the end of 2024. Think of a four-year college degree as a ladder to higher earning potential. But what if each rung of that ladder is made of debt? The higher you climb, the heavier that debt becomes, slowing your progress and making it harder to reach your goals. While a college degree may lead to higher lifetime earnings, studies show that graduates with significant student loan debt often see their net wealth accumulate more slowly than those who pursue alternative paths without debt. This debt can delay major life milestones. As *Forbes* reported, college tuition has skyrocketed, with the total price to attend a four-year college full-time increasing by 169% between 1980 and 2020. Moreover, the long-term costs of income-driven repayment plans can be staggering. As one report indicates, the repayment term can stretch for 20 or 25 years, leading some borrowers to feel like they are in debt forever. Therefore, the crippling debt burden significantly diminishes the perceived benefits of a four-year degree.<br><br>Second, the skills gap is a growing concern that undermines the value of a traditional four-year degree. Employers are increasingly seeking specific, practical skills that many college programs simply don't provide. While a college degree can offer a broad education, many employers need graduates who can immediately contribute with specialized knowledge. A *2021 report by Cengage*, a leading education technology company, revealed that almost half of higher ed graduates don’t apply to entry-level jobs because they don’t feel they have the right skills. Vocational training programs offer specialized skills in high-demand fields, often leading to immediate employment. This emphasis on theoretical knowledge over practical application leaves many graduates underprepared for the workforce.<br><br>In conclusion, while a college degree can offer some advantages, we must recognize the significant challenges posed by student loan debt and the widening skills gap. These factors collectively undermine the notion that a four-year degree is universally beneficial for young adults in today's society. We need to consider alternative paths such as vocational training and apprenticeships, which can offer valuable skills and career opportunities without the burden of excessive debt.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that pursuing a 4-year college degree is no longer universally beneficial for young adults in today's society. We define beneficial as producing good results or helpful effects and being advantageous. We consider young adults to be individuals between the ages of 18 and 25. Today's society refers to the current socio-economic and technological environment. Are judging criteria is opportunity cost and return on investment. We believe the winning side will demonstrate the greatest return on investment. And minimize opportunity cost for young adults. Roi should be calculated by assessing the financial investment. Tuition fees lost wages. Versus potential earnings job security and career advancement opportunities. Opportunity cost includes alternative career paths skill development options and entrepreneurial ventures that young adults may forgo by pursuing a four-year degree. First the rising cost of education outweighs the potential earnings for many fields. The financial burden of a 4-year degree has become increasingly unsustainable. Tuition costs have sky. Leading to crippling student loan debt for many graduates the college board reports that the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2023 2024 school year. Was 11,260 at 4 year public colleges for in-state students. And 41,420 at private nonprofit colleges. Meanwhile according to a study by georgetown university center on education and the workforce. 40% of bachelor's degree holders earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. This disparity highlights a critical issue. The investment in a four-year degree does not guarantee a commensurate financial return. Especially in fields like humanities and social sciences. Leaving many graduates with a negative roi and a mountain of debt. Second skills-based training and vocational programs offer a faster and more direct route to employment in high demand industries. The modern job market increasingly values specific practical skills over broad theoretical knowledge. According to a manpower group survey 69% of employers globally are struggling to find workers with the right skills. Vocational programs in skills-based training provide targeted education and hands-on experience leading to quicker job placement and higher earning potential in fields like technology healthcare and skilled trades. For example a coding bootcamp can equip an individual with the skills to become a software developer in a matter of months allowing them to enter the workforce much faster. And with significantly less debt than a traditional computer science graduate. This direct pathway to employment addresses the skills gap. And provides a more efficient use of time and resources for young adults. 3rd degree inflation devalues the four year degree. Creating unnecessary barriers to entry level positions. Employers are increasingly requiring a 4-year degree for positions that do not inherently need one. A phenomenon known as degree inflation. A harvard business school study found that many middle skills jobs now stipulate. A college degree. As a minimum requirement. Even though only a third of the adults holding those positions possess one for. This artificial credential creates an unnecessary barrier to entry for individuals with valuable skills and experience. Acquired through alternative educational path. Or on-the-job training. It also forces young adults to incur unnecessary debt for a credential that does not guarantee better job performance or career advancement. According to test gorilla only 7% of the world's population holds a bachelor's degree 5.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">To quickly summarize our rebuttal, we will address the opposition's key concerns, reinforcing that a college degree offers enduring advantages beyond immediate financial returns.<br><br>First, the opposition makes a broad claim that a four-year college degree is no longer universally beneficial. However, this is a hasty generalization. While alternative paths certainly have value, a college education still offers significant advantages in career opportunities and overall growth for most young adults. The opposition fails to acknowledge that college provides invaluable networking opportunities. To ensure that individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including low-income and first-generation college students, have the resources to succeed, *the U.S. Department of Education* has Federal TRIO Programs in place.<br><br>Second, they judge the worth of college solely on ROI and opportunity cost. But education offers critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and personal growth. These intangible benefits are difficult to quantify, but they have a large impact. As *Collegenp* reported in 2024, educators emphasize fostering critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability in students to prepare them for a dynamic workforce. The narrow focus on ROI misses the broader societal benefits, like informed citizens and increased social mobility.<br><br>As we discussed in our opening statement, a college degree significantly boosts lifetime earnings. According to *research from PMC*, men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $896,000 more and women earn $630,000 more than high school graduates over a 50-year period. This increased earning potential provides long-term financial security that far outweighs the initial investment.<br><br>The opponent argues that rising costs outweigh potential earnings, but this ignores the long-term earning potential a degree unlocks. Plus, the argument that all wages are stagnant is misleading. Many specialized professions require knowledge gained through higher education that generate higher wages. Furthermore, policies promoting affordable tuition, expanding access to financial aid, and encouraging responsible borrowing can mitigate these challenges.<br><br>College also equips graduates to adapt to the changing job market. It provides a solid foundation for continuous learning and develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Adaptability is key, and a college education cultivates it. As highlighted in *a 2023 study*, critical thinking equips individuals with the ability to analyze complex information, discern credible sources, and make informed decisions, which is essential in today's rapidly evolving job market.<br><br>Opponents suggest skills-based training is better, but vocational programs can become obsolete. A college degree provides a broader base for continuous learning. It allows graduates to adapt to new technologies and career shifts throughout their lives. Moreover, college graduates demonstrate greater career resilience compared to those with only vocational training.<br><br>Furthermore, college promotes a more inclusive and equitable society by providing opportunities for all. It helps level the playing field, fostering diversity, and promoting social mobility.<br><br>Finally, while degree inflation is a concern, it doesn't negate the fundamental value of a college education. A degree still signifies knowledge, critical thinking, and commitment that employers seek. A college degree remains a valuable investment. As *a 2021 report* indicates, despite rising costs and student debt, the long-term financial benefits of a four-year college degree remain indisputable, leading to better economic outcomes and wealth accumulation.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three key flaws, which are: their narrow judging criteria, the overestimation of vocational training, and a misunderstanding of degree inflation.<br><br>First, the opposing side has framed this debate solely on "return on investment" and "opportunity cost," neglecting the broader benefits of a college education. We contend that this narrow economic lens fails to capture the complete picture. A college education isn't just about immediate financial gain; it's an investment in a lifetime of personal and societal enrichment. We should instead be looking at "return on life," encompassing civic engagement, improved well-being, and leadership skills . While they focus on initial costs, we emphasize the long-term advantages, arguing that a college degree provides a foundation for not only financial security but also a more fulfilling and impactful life.<br><br>Second, our opponents champion skills-based training as a superior alternative, but this view is short-sighted. While vocational programs may offer a quicker entry into the workforce, the jobs obtained often have lower long-term earning potential and less job security . Furthermore, their claim that a ManpowerGroup survey supports their argument is misleading, as the survey addresses skill shortages across *all* industries, not just those suited to vocational training . A college education provides a broader skillset applicable to a wider range of jobs, making graduates more adaptable in our rapidly changing economy. For example, someone starting a business might learn a trade through vocational training, but a college degree offers a more well-rounded approach, improving their chances of overall success.<br><br>Third, the opposing side argues that degree inflation devalues a four-year degree, and they cite the statistic that only 7% of the *world's* population holds a bachelor's degree . This statistic is irrelevant to the American job market. In fact, the phenomenon of degree inflation actually *strengthens* our argument. While we acknowledge that employers are increasingly requiring degrees for positions that may not have needed them in the past, this makes a college degree *more* necessary to compete. Employers still value the critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills that are cultivated through a college education .<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to the point. We're evaluating whether a four-year college degree is truly 'beneficial' for young adults today, focusing on positive outcomes, genuine helpfulness, and overall advantage. We're defining 'young adults' as those aged 18 to 25 and judging the value of a four-year degree based on opportunity cost and return on investment in today's society.<br><br>First, let's tackle the elephant in the room: the soaring cost of college. The opposition seems to downplay this, but it's a critical issue. *U.S. News & World Report* data from the past 20 years clearly shows a significant upward trend in tuition and fees at both private and public National Universities. This financial burden significantly diminishes the perceived benefits of a four-year degree, especially when many graduates find their earning potential doesn't even surpass that of someone with just a high school diploma.<br><br>Second, we maintain that skills-based training offers a more efficient and effective alternative. Employers are actively seeking skilled workers, and vocational programs provide those skills directly and immediately. It's like learning to swim by jumping straight into the pool, rather than spending years reading about swimming in a textbook. This direct approach translates to quicker entry into the workforce and less debt.<br><br>Third, the issue of degree inflation cannot be ignored. Companies are increasingly requiring degrees for positions that don't genuinely necessitate them, creating unnecessary barriers to entry for capable individuals. A four-year degree simply does not guarantee a good return on investment. Only a small percentage of the global population even holds a bachelor's degree, suggesting that it's not the only path to success.<br><br>Now, let's address some of the arguments presented by the opposing side. They argue that college provides unparalleled career opportunities and fosters overall growth. However, this is a sweeping generalization that doesn't hold true for everyone. For example, students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds may struggle to afford college even with financial aid, and the stress of balancing work and studies can negatively impact their academic performance. Imagine a student struggling to afford textbooks or lacking access to tutoring – these are real challenges that can hinder their success. Increased funding for scholarships and grants, along with the expansion of work-study programs, are potential solutions. They also claim that college is essential for developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills. However, according to *LinkedIn's 2023* report on skills employers look for, problem-solving, analytical skills, and adaptability are also highly valued and can be acquired through vocational programs or on-the-job training.<br><br>The opposition also claims that college provides a broader base for learning. While a degree certainly has value, it doesn't mean that those without one are destined for failure. They further argue that college graduates are more adaptable. However, vocational skills often translate directly into high-demand jobs, making these workers incredibly valuable and adaptable in their specific fields. In fact, adaptability, as *LinkedIn* reported in *2023*, has more to do with a willingness to learn and grow, regardless of formal education. The other side suggests that a degree demonstrates knowledge and commitment. However, employers are increasingly recognizing that degrees don't always equate to practical skills.<br><br>Finally, let's briefly revisit our definitions. Their definition of young adults fails to acknowledge the diverse realities of different socioeconomic backgrounds. Their definition of 'beneficial' overlooks the significant burden of debt and opportunity cost.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal fails to address the core issues we raised. Their arguments contain several flaws, specifically regarding their judging criteria, their unsubstantiated claims about networking, their misleading statistics on lifetime earnings, their misunderstanding of adaptability, and their inadequate response to the problem of degree inflation.<br><br>First, the opposition argues for a vague notion of "societal benefit" as a primary criterion, but this is far too subjective and immeasurable. We maintain that Return on Investment and Opportunity Cost are the superior metrics because they offer a tangible and concrete way to evaluate the true value of a four-year degree for young adults. What good is a "societal benefit" when an individual is saddled with debt and limited career prospects? Intangible benefits, such as critical thinking and problem solving, are not exclusive to college; they can also be acquired through vocational training, entrepreneurship, and real-world experiences. While college may promote social mobility, so too do successful vocational programs and entrepreneurial ventures. The focus must remain on what provides the best individual outcome, not a nebulous societal good .<br><br>Second, the affirmative presents the existence of Federal TRIO programs as sufficient evidence that college provides networking opportunities and resources for disadvantaged students. However, they fail to provide any actual evidence that these programs are broadly successful. The reality is that many disadvantaged students still struggle to navigate the college system, and the reach of TRIO programs is limited. Networking opportunities are not exclusive to college campuses; they are readily available through professional organizations, online communities, and industry events, often at a fraction of the cost .<br><br>Third, the opposition's claims about increased lifetime earnings are misleading. While some graduates may earn more over their lifetimes, this is heavily dependent on their field of study. Many college graduates, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. Furthermore, they completely ignore the opportunity cost of lost wages during the four years spent in college, as well as the burden of student loan debt, which can significantly impact long-term financial well-being . The affirmative's circular reasoning claims a college degree boosts lifetime earnings, which generates wealth accumulation; however, the reference for this claim comes from the same PMC report, making the argument flawed.<br><br>Fourth, the affirmative equivocates on the meaning of "adaptability." While a general education may provide a broad base of knowledge, vocational training offers immediately applicable skills and adaptability *within* a specific field, which is often more valuable in today's rapidly changing job market. The skills gap persists despite the increasing number of college graduates, demonstrating that a college degree does not automatically translate to job readiness. Instead of preparing graduates for specific jobs, colleges provide general skills that require additional training after graduation .<br><br>Fifth, and finally, the opposition fails to adequately address the growing problem of degree inflation. Multiple sources confirm that employers are increasingly requiring a four-year degree for positions that don't necessarily need one, creating unnecessary barriers to entry-level jobs . This trend forces young adults to incur unnecessary debt for a credential that does not guarantee better job performance or career advancement, exacerbating inequality and hindering economic mobility.<br><br>In conclusion,<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We've explored today the crucial question of whether a four-year college degree remains a worthwhile pursuit for young adults. We firmly believe it absolutely does.<br><br>While the opposition focused on immediate gains, let's consider the long-term financial security a college degree provides. *The Social Security Administration reported in 2022* that men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more over their careers than those with only a high school diploma . Yes, tuition costs are a concern, but affordable tuition policies and increased financial aid can effectively address them. The long-term earning potential makes college a sound investment.<br><br>Furthermore, college cultivates adaptability, a crucial skill in today's rapidly changing job market. While vocational training offers specific skills, a college degree provides a broader foundation. *A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research* demonstrates that college graduates exhibit greater career resilience, adapting more readily to evolving job demands .<br><br>Moreover, college promotes a more inclusive society by expanding opportunities and fostering diversity. While some argue that degree inflation diminishes its value, a degree still signifies a commitment to knowledge, critical thinking, and perseverance. *The Association of American Colleges and Universities reported in 2020* that employers consistently prioritize these qualities when hiring new graduates .<br><br>In conclusion, a college degree remains a valuable investment, offering financial security, adaptability, and promoting inclusivity. We urge you to support policies that make college accessible to all. Let's continue to champion the enduring value of higher education.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the enduring benefits of a four-year college degree for young adults in today's society.<br><br>The core disagreement lies in how we define "beneficial." Our opponents narrowly focus on Return on Investment , neglecting the broader advantages a college education offers. We maintain that "beneficial" encompasses not only financial gains but also personal growth, expanded career opportunities, and social mobility. Studies show that college graduates demonstrate increased civic engagement, improved well-being, and better access to healthcare, all contributing to a more fulfilling life . ROI alone cannot capture these crucial aspects.<br><br>While our opponents highlight the potential of vocational training, we argue that a college education provides a robust foundation for long-term career success and adaptability. Graduates develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills that remain valuable across industries, enabling them to navigate career transitions effectively . The job market is rapidly evolving. College equips individuals with a framework for continuous learning, preparing them for unforeseen changes and diverse career paths, compared to the narrower focus of vocational programs.<br><br>Our opponents point to rising tuition costs and student debt as significant barriers. We acknowledge these challenges, but emphasize that, on average, college graduates still earn significantly more over their lifetimes than those with only a high school diploma . This increased earning potential can outweigh the initial investment, providing greater financial security and opportunities for wealth accumulation . We must address the student debt crisis through policy changes and increased financial aid, not by dismissing the proven benefits of higher education.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, we've reached the heart of this debate: what offers young adults the best return on investment? Our opponents champion the "societal benefits" of a four-year degree. However, we've demonstrated that skills-based training offers a more direct route to financial independence and career success. Remember to consider which side provides a better return on investment.<br><br>First, vocational programs provide immediate advantages. They equip individuals with in-demand, job-ready skills, leading to faster employment and greater earning potential than many four-year degrees. The ROI is undeniably superior.<br><br>Second, while our opponents claim college fosters adaptability, we argue that adaptability within a specific field is more valuable. Vocational training delivers precisely that, ensuring graduates are immediately employable with the specific skills employers need. They are not just knowledgeable but also job-ready.<br><br>Finally, our opponents have failed to address degree inflation adequately. The increasing demand for degrees, even for jobs that don't require them, forces young adults into unnecessary debt, hindering their financial future. As *Forbes magazine reported*, the often-cited statistic of $900,000 in lifetime earnings ignores the opportunity cost of four years in college, lost earnings, and accumulated debt.<br><br>Therefore, a vote for our side is a vote for fiscal responsibility, empowering young adults with practical skills for a debt-free future. It's a vote for economic freedom and a tangible return on investment. We urge you to support a path that prioritizes individual success. Thank you.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around whether a four-year college degree remains universally beneficial for young adults, and we firmly believe it is not.<br><br>The affirmative side asks you to prioritize a vague and immeasurable "societal benefit" when evaluating the worth of a college degree. We maintain that Return on Investment and Opportunity Cost are the superior metrics because they offer a tangible and concrete way to evaluate the true value of a four-year degree for young adults. What good is a "societal benefit" when an individual is saddled with debt and limited career prospects? Moreover, successful vocational programs and entrepreneurial ventures also promote social mobility .<br><br>The claim that college provides invaluable networking opportunities through programs such as Federal TRIO is not supported by evidence. The affirmative side fails to demonstrate the broad success of these programs. Networking opportunities are readily available through professional organizations and online communities, often at a fraction of the cost .<br><br>The opposition's claims about increased lifetime earnings are misleading. While some graduates may earn more over their lifetimes, this is heavily dependent on their field of study. Many college graduates, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. They also ignore the opportunity cost of lost wages during the four years spent in college, as well as student loan debt, which can significantly impact long-term financial well-being .<br><br>The affirmative equivocates on the meaning of "adaptability." While a general education may provide a broad base of knowledge, vocational training offers immediately applicable skills and adaptability *within* a specific field, which is often more valuable in today's rapidly changing job market.<br><br>
