                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss the crucial role that processed foods should play in sustainable food systems. To ensure a productive conversation, let's define our terms. "Processed foods" encompass any transformation beyond basic cleaning or cutting, including preservation and packaging. A "sustainable food system," as we define it, minimizes environmental harm, is economically sound, and provides nutritional security for all, without jeopardizing future generations.<br><br>When evaluating our arguments today, we should prioritize those that demonstrably improve food security and environmental sustainability, especially for our most vulnerable populations.<br><br>With that in mind, I will present three key arguments demonstrating why processed foods are not just relevant, but essential, to building sustainable food systems.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly enhance food security by extending shelf life and drastically reducing waste. Unlike fresh produce, which spoils rapidly, processed foods offer a longer shelf life. This extended usability reduces spoilage, making food available for longer periods and in more locations. *Food Safety*, a trusted resource on food-related topics, reports that studies show about 50 percent of consumer food waste can be prevented by extending the shelf life of the food product. This is particularly critical in regions with limited access to fresh food or unreliable supply chains. Moreover, *a 2019 study* highlights that wastage of processed fruits and vegetables is approximately 14% lower than that of fresh produce. This demonstrates the power of processing to minimize waste across the supply chain.<br><br>Second, processed foods are often more accessible and affordable than fresh produce, especially for individuals with limited time for meal preparation, disabilities that make cooking difficult, or those living in areas with limited transportation options. While we acknowledge concerns about the nutritional profile of some processed foods, it's important to recognize that they provide essential calories and nutrients to individuals who would otherwise struggle to obtain sufficient nourishment. According to *The Annie E. Casey Foundation in 2024*, meals rich in vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts are, on average, $1.50 more expensive per day than diets rich in processed foods, meats, and refined grains. Furthermore, *WebMD* notes that U.S. food producers have been fortifying foods since the 1920s to prevent nutrition-related illnesses.<br><br>Third, processing enables the utilization of agricultural byproducts and waste streams, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. As highlighted in *a 2021 study in PMC*, extrusion processing can be an excellent avenue for the utilization of these by-products in foods.<br><br>Therefore, processed foods are not the antithesis of a sustainable food system; they are, in fact, a critical tool for achieving it, and should be considered by individuals, and supported by policymakers.<br>***<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems, which we define as food systems that provide food security and nutrition for current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same, encompassing environmental, economic, and social dimensions. Processed foods refer to foods altered from their natural state through methods like canning, freezing, drying, or adding preservatives.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing global food security and minimizing environmental impact. The side that demonstrates the greatest potential for ensuring access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food for a growing global population while simultaneously minimizing negative environmental consequences, such as greenhouse gas emissions, resource depletion, and pollution, should win the debate.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly reduce food waste and extend shelf life, increasing overall food availability. The Sustainable Nutrition Initiative highlights that processed foods can reduce food waste, extend shelf life, and make nutritious food more affordable and accessible globally . Preserving foods through processing ensures food safety and prolongs their shelf life, so less food is wasted . By minimizing spoilage, processed foods ensure that more of what is produced reaches consumers, especially in areas with poor infrastructure where fresh food is likely to spoil quickly.<br><br>Second, processed foods can be more resource-efficient than fresh produce, thereby reducing environmental impact. Although often criticized for their environmental impact, processed foods can sometimes have a lower carbon footprint compared to fresh foods. This is due to reduced transportation needs and optimized storage emissions . Additionally, food processing enhances the convenience and variety of available foods, encouraging consumption and reducing waste . This efficiency in resource utilization makes processed foods a practical component of a sustainable food system.<br><br>Third, innovations in food processing enhance nutrient availability and promote healthier diets. Food processing technologies can improve the nutritional profile of foods through fortification and reformulation, addressing specific dietary deficiencies. Food processing plays a crucial role in providing adequate nutrition to a growing global population . Ongoing research focuses on developing healthier, tastier, and more sustainable processed foods produced from local raw materials . These advancements ensure that processed foods contribute positively to public health and overall sustainability.<br><br>In conclusion, processed foods, when produced and consumed thoughtfully, are indispensable for a sustainable food system. Their ability to reduce waste, increase resource efficiency, and enhance nutrient availability makes them essential for feeding a growing global population while minimizing environmental impact.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. My team and I stand firmly against the proposition that processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems.<br><br>To begin, let's define our terms. Our opponents will likely define "processed foods" very broadly, encompassing almost anything beyond basic washing or cutting. While processed foods *can* include things like pasteurized milk, the *core issue* lies in the prevalence of *unhealthy* processed foods – those loaded with added sugars, unhealthy fats, and artificial ingredients – which have a disproportionately negative impact on public health and the environment. While some processed foods are fortified, the overall nutritional profile of a diet heavily reliant on these products is often inferior to a diet rich in fresh, whole foods. Moreover, fortification doesn't address the other negative impacts, such as increased environmental pollution and market distortions. Therefore, for the sake of this debate, we must focus on these *unhealthy* processed foods.<br><br>Next, consider the judging criteria. While our opponents will undoubtedly prioritize arguments around boosting food security and environmental sustainability, this completely overlooks the crucial element of *public health*. A truly sustainable food system must support not only the planet and access to food, but also the health of its citizens.<br><br>With these points clarified, let's examine why expanding the role of processed foods is a detrimental idea.<br><br>First, increased processed food consumption worsens health inequities, especially in low-income communities. These foods are often cheaper and more readily available in these areas, leading to higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases. As Dr. Martin Weber, Team Lead for Quality of Care at WHO/Europe, stated in his 2024 report, "The inequality epidemic: low-income teens face higher rates of obesity," highlighting that "the affordability and accessibility of healthy food options are often limited for families with lower incomes, leading to a higher reliance on processed and sugary foods, which can have detrimental effects on adolescent health" . It’s a vicious cycle that reinforces existing health disparities. While processed foods might seem like a solution to food insecurity, they often fail to address underlying issues such as poverty, lack of education, and unequal access to land and resources.<br><br>Second, expanding processed food production intensifies environmental pollution. Think about the packaging waste, transportation emissions, and resource-intensive manufacturing. According to *ScienceDirect's 2024 report on Carbon footprints evaluation for sustainable food*, transportation emissions account for almost 43% of total emissions in the food supply chain . The refining, chemical modification, and packaging of processed foods consume vast amounts of energy and water, and generate substantial waste. According to the EPA, in 2019, about 60% of wasted food was sent to landfills .<br><br>Third, government subsidies distort the market, favoring commodity crops like corn and soy, which are heavily used in processed foods. This creates an uneven playing field for farmers who grow fruits, vegetables, and other nutritious foods. *An American Enterprise Institute  study in 2023* by Chris Edwards argued that the crop insurance program provides farmers with incentives to waste resources through moral hazard .<br><br>In conclusion, relying on processed foods is not a sustainable solution. A sustainable food system requires a holistic approach that prioritizes public health and addresses the root causes of food insecurity, reduces the environmental impact, and ensures a level playing field for all producers.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is detrimental to overall sustainability due to their environmental impact, adverse health effects, and the hindering of more sustainable alternatives. We define **processed foods** as foods altered from their natural state through methods like canning, freezing, drying, or the addition of additives . A **sustainable food system** is one that provides food security and nutrition for current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same, being environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially equitable .<br><br>Our judging criteria prioritize **holistic sustainability**, meaning the judge should favor the side that best promotes environmental health, human well-being, and the long-term viability of food systems. Arguments favoring processed foods should be rejected if they significantly harm any of these core pillars, even if offering short-term gains in areas like affordability.<br><br>First, increasing reliance on processed foods exacerbates environmental degradation. Processed food production relies on resource-intensive agriculture, contributing to deforestation and high greenhouse gas emissions . For example, the production of ultra-processed foods contributes heavily to waste and emissions, undermining environmental sustainability . Studies show that processed food production significantly harms the environment through land degradation and increased food waste . This reliance on intensive farming methods and non-biodegradable packaging further strains our planet's resources . Thus, the environmental costs associated with processed foods outweigh any perceived benefits in a sustainable system.<br><br>Second, a greater role for processed foods undermines human health. These foods are often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, leading to increased rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes . Research indicates that ultra-processed foods are particularly concerning due to their association with numerous health issues . Increased consumption of processed foods is linked to higher risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, ultra-processed foods are associated with numerous health issues . Therefore, promoting processed foods undermines the goal of creating healthy, resilient populations.<br><br>Third, prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of more sustainable alternatives. Focusing on processed foods distracts from investing in regenerative agriculture, local food systems, and plant-based diets, which offer long-term benefits for both the environment and human health . Sustainable food systems promote healthy alternatives to processed foods, emphasizing local, fresh produce . Specifically, these systems reduce environmental impact and support community health by growing and consuming locally sourced foods . Prioritizing processed foods diverts resources and attention from more sustainable and beneficial practices, hindering the transition to a truly sustainable food system.<br><br>In conclusion, increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is counterproductive. It worsens environmental problems, harms human health, and impedes the development of genuinely sustainable alternatives. We urge the judge to oppose this motion and support a future where food systems prioritize health, environment, and long-term viability.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate the opponent's perspective, but we believe they've presented an incomplete picture. We'll clarify key definitions and demonstrate how processed foods are crucial for a truly sustainable food system, especially when considering the needs of vulnerable populations.<br><br>First, let's address the definition of processed foods. The opponent defines it too narrowly. Our definition includes basic preservation and packaging techniques. These steps are vital for reducing waste and extending shelf life, which are essential for sustainability. It's an oversimplification to exclude these processes, as they directly impact food availability and reduce overall waste in the supply chain. According to *KHNI*, extending the shelf life of food products has rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to support and promote sustainability .<br><br>Second, we reinforce the core principles of a sustainable food system. It minimizes environmental harm, is economically sound, and provides nutritional security for all, without jeopardizing future generations. Arguments that improve food security and environmental sustainability, especially for our most vulnerable populations, should be prioritized. These are the metrics to evaluate our arguments.<br><br>Third, processed foods significantly enhance food security. They extend shelf life and drastically reduce waste. As *the BBC reported in 2021*, ultra-processed foods can help reduce emissions because they are made to last longer, so we're less likely to waste them . While the opponent may point to wastage of processed fruits and vegetables being approximately 14% lower than that of fresh produce, we must consider the broader impact.<br><br>Fourth, processed foods are often more accessible and affordable, especially for those with limited time, disabilities, or transportation challenges. Meals rich in fresh foods are significantly more expensive, particularly in food deserts. *The Food Revolution Network* points out that food subsidies have caused the price of processed foods and industrial meat to decrease by 20-30% over the last four decades, while the price of fruits and vegetables has increased by 40% .<br><br>Fifth, processing enables the utilization of agricultural byproducts and waste streams, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. This contributes to resource efficiency. By adopting a circular economy approach, by-product utilization in agriculture will flourish. Rather than treating by-products as wastes, there is a growing trend to integrate them into the production process.<br><br>Now, let's address the opponent's concerns. We acknowledge that the production of *some* processed foods can have a significant environmental footprint. However, advancements in sustainable processing and packaging offer opportunities to dramatically reduce these impacts. For example, *ScienceDirect* highlights that technologies like microwaves, ultrasound, and nonthermal plasma are rapidly being adapted by the food industry to save production resources and improve food quality .<br><br>They also claim processed foods undermine human health. While *Harvard Health* notes in a 2024 review that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher risks of certain health issues, they also acknowledge that some ultra-processed whole-grain breads, breakfast cereals, and yogurts were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .<br><br>Finally, they argue that prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of more sustainable alternatives. This is a false dilemma. We can and should invest in both.<br><br>Therefore, processed foods are an important key to food sustainability.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. Esteemed judges ladies and gentlemen the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws. Which are their narrow definition of processed foods? They're vague judging criteria of holistic sustainability. And their claims about mental and health impacts. First the opposition defines processed foods too narrowly. Focusing only on alterations like canning and adding additives. This definition doesn't reflect the reality of modern food systems. Almost all foods undergo some form of processing. Even simple washing and packaging. Food science recognizes that processing encompasses a wide range of techniques. That improved safety extend shelf life. An enhanced nutrient availability 1. By trying to narrowly define processed foods. To include only the unhealthiest options. They created a distorted picture of what we are actually advocating for. Therefore. We maintain that our broader definition. Encompassing all transformations beyond basic cleaning is more accurate and reflects the reality of modern food systems. This ensures a more comprehensive and relevant debate. The opposition's judging criteria of holistic sustainability is too vague and can be easily manipulated. While we agree that environmental health and human well-being are important prioritizing food security is a necessary component of any truly sustainable system. People cannot focus on long-term environmental goals if they are struggling to access sufficient and affordable food today. Our focus is on ensuring that everyone has access to nutritious food and processed foods play a vital role in achieving that goal. Thus we assert that food security must be a central pillar of sustainability not a secondary consideration. This allows for policies that address immediate needs while striving for long-term sustainability. Third our opponents claim that processed foods always lead to environmental degradation. But this is simply not true. Many processed foods actually reduce emissions by preventing spoilage. Utilizing agricultural by-products and requiring less transportation than fresh alternatives. Moreover innovations in sustainable food processing such as ai and advanced technologies are further reducing the environmental impact of these foods for six. For example canned tomatoes and frozen fruits due to their efficient supply chains and reduced spoilage. Can i have a lower carbon footprint than fresh produce transported over long distances. Therefore their claim of inherent environmental harm is demonstrably false and processed foods can in many cases. Contribute to a more environmentally sound food system. The opposition equates all processed foods with unhealthy options high in sugar and fat. But this is a straw man argument. We are not advocating for only unhealthy processed foods many processed foods are fortified with essential nutrients and can be a part of a healthy diet. Especially for those with limited access to fresh produce. In fact studies show that meals rich in vegetables fruits fish and nuts are on average $1.50 more expensive per day than diets including processed foods. This refutes their assertion that processed foods are inherently unhealthy. And highlights their crucial role in providing affordable nutrition to vulnerable populations. The opposition claims that prioritizing processed foods. Prevents investing in regenerative agriculture and local food systems. This is a false dile. We can and should invest in both. Processed foods can actually support sustainable agriculture by providing a market for imperfect produce an agricultural byproduct. Food processing can help increase the convenience in variety of available foods. This leads to increased consumption which in turn supports local farmers.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate the opponent's points, but we firmly believe that increasing the role of processed foods is not the answer to creating sustainable food systems. We will address several key areas where their arguments fall short, demonstrating why a focus on whole, less processed options is crucial for a truly sustainable future.<br><br>First, the opponent attempts to broaden the definition of "processed foods" to include basic preservation techniques. However, this obscures the critical distinction between minimally processed and ultra-processed foods. As we've stated, ultra-processed options are often packed with unhealthy ingredients, negating any potential benefits they might offer.<br><br>Second, regarding environmental impact, the opponent suggests that advancements are making processed foods more sustainable. The problem, however, is that the sheer scale of processed food production generates enormous environmental costs that outweigh any potential efficiency gains. It doesn't solve the core issue. According to *a 2024 report by Rubicon*, processed foods often require more packaging than fresh counterparts, and much of this packaging ends up as waste instead of being recycled .<br><br>Third, when it comes to health, they highlight a few processed items that might have some benefits. However, the vast majority of processed foods remain high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Prioritizing whole, unprocessed foods is essential for long-term health. *A long-term study of nearly 100,000 U.S. adults* found that participants reporting the highest consumption of ultra-processed foods had a 49% greater risk of being diagnosed with cancer. This was according to *a 2018 study published in the BMJ* titled "Ultra-processed food consumption and risk of cancer: results from NutriNet-Santé prospective cohort" .<br><br>Now, let's address accessibility and affordability. The opponent claims processed foods are more accessible, especially in food deserts. But simply making unhealthy options available doesn't solve the problem. We should be focusing on improving access to *healthier* alternatives in those areas. Also, while processed foods might seem cheaper now, they lead to long-term health problems and increased healthcare costs. It's like choosing a cheap car that constantly needs repairs; it costs you more in the long run. *PMC reported in 2023* that low-income families, especially those in food deserts, face significant systemic barriers to accessing affordable and nutritious food .<br><br>Let's tackle food security. The opponent argues processed foods enhance food security by lasting longer. However, relying on these foods makes communities dependent on large corporations. We need resilient, local food systems, not reliance on processed products.<br><br>Finally, they suggest we can invest in both processed foods and sustainable alternatives. This is a false choice. Focusing on processed foods distracts from investing in things like regenerative agriculture and local food systems. It diverts resources from more sustainable solutions.<br><br>In conclusion, we maintain that prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of truly sustainable food systems. A focus on supporting local food systems and regenerative agriculture is essential for creating a healthier and more resilient future.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. A steam judges ladies and gentlemen. The opponent's rebuttals contains several flaws. We will address their inaccurate definition of processed foods. They're inadequate consideration of long-term sustainability. They're overestimation of processed foods impact on food security. They're misrepresentation of affordability their exaggeration of byproduct utilization. They're down playing of environmental impacts. They're selective highlighting of health effects and their creation of a false dilemma regarding sustainable alternatives. First the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of processed foods to include basic preservation and packaging one. However this definition is overly broad and deviates from the common understanding and expert consensus. Established food science organizations. Such as the fda and usda define processed foods more specifically. As foods altered from their natural state. Through methods like canning freezing drying or the addition of additives. The affirmative is broad definition of effectively encompasses nearly all foods. Rendering the debate meaningless and preventing us from addressing the real issues at hand. Therefore their subsequent arguments built upon this flaw definition lack of solid foundation. Second while the affirmative prioritizes short-term food security. We must reiterate the importance of holistic sustainability. A truly sustainable food system considers not only immediate needs but also the long-term health and environmental consequences. Studies consistently demonstrate the detrimental long-term health impacts of diets high in processed foods. Including increased risks of obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore the environmental costs of processed food production such as resource depletion and pollution. Undermine any short-term gains in food security. This shows that even if processed foods offer immediate benefits they compromised the long-term viability of our food systems. Negating their supposed sustainability. The claim that processed foods significantly enhance food security is overstated. While processed foods can extend shelf life the affirmatives reliance on cage and i. An industry source introduces bias. Well one could cherry pick reports that ultra-processed foods can help reduce emissions as pointed out by the bbc. The overall impact of ultra-processed food production contributes heavily to waste and emissions as the soil association rightly highlights 3 5. Improved supply chain management and investment in local food systems offer more sustainable and resilient solutions to food security challenges. Thus relying on processed foods for food security is a band-aid solution compared to more comprehensive sustainable approaches. Fourth the affordability of processed foods is often a result of market distortions caused by subsidies. As they point out by citing the food revolution network. These subsidies artificially lower the price of processed foods while simultaneously increasing the price of fresh fruits and vegetables. When considering the long-term health care costs associated with diets high in processed foods? The true cost is significantly higher. By not addressing the financial burden associated with healthcare. The affirmative is failing to offer a truly sustainable solution. This exposes the illusion of affordability. As the long-term costs outweigh any perceived short-term savings. Fifth while processing can enable the utilization of agricultural by-products. The overall impact of processed food production still leads to significant waste. Simpler and more sustainable methods such as composting and using by-products for animal feed offer more effective ways to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">As we conclude this debate, it's clear the core disagreement centers on the role of processed foods in a sustainable future. While the opposition paints a grim picture, we advocate for a pragmatic understanding. This includes recognizing essential processes like preservation and packaging, vital for minimizing waste and ensuring broad food access.<br><br>Consider the single parent working multiple jobs or the senior with mobility issues. For these individuals, affordable, nutritious, and often processed foods are indispensable. Our vision of a sustainable food system isn't just about idealistic environmental standards; it's about ensuring everyone, especially the vulnerable, has access to nourishment.<br><br>Our opponents overstate the health and environmental concerns. It's crucial to remember that processed foods are not a monolith. Innovation and reformulation can lead to healthier options with reduced environmental impact. Their arguments fail to account for progress, clinging to outdated notions. For example, *a 2023 report by the Food Processing Suppliers Association* highlights advancements in processing technologies that significantly reduce energy consumption and waste .<br><br>Therefore, the choice is clear. Support a system that acknowledges the realities of modern life, embraces innovation, and prioritizes accessibility alongside sustainability. Choose a future where no one is left behind. Processed foods, when produced and consumed responsibly, are not the enemy. They are a crucial component of a sustainable and equitable food future for all. As *research from the World Food Programme in 2022* indicates, processed foods play a critical role in emergency food relief, providing stable and nutritious options in crisis situations . This underscores their importance in ensuring food security globally.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the **definition of processed foods and how they fit into sustainable food systems**.<br><br>The opposition has attempted to narrowly define "processed foods," excluding basic preservation and packaging . We contend that this exclusion is impractical. Any meaningful discussion of sustainable food systems must address waste reduction, and preservation and packaging are inherent to that process. The alternative, as the opposition seems to suggest, is to discard perfectly good food, an unsustainable proposition, especially for vulnerable populations.<br><br>Furthermore, the opposition presents a false dichotomy between short-term food security and long-term sustainability. We firmly believe that both are achievable and necessary. Sustainable processing technologies are rapidly evolving, offering ways to reduce environmental impact while ensuring food remains accessible . Processed foods serve as a vital bridge, addressing immediate nutritional needs as we transition to more regenerative agricultural practices.<br><br>While the opposition questions the extent to which processed foods enhance food security and attempts to undermine our data with the soil association, we maintain that they play a crucial role, especially given the imperfections in current supply chains and the limitations of local food systems. They fill a critical gap, ensuring that food reaches those who need it most, complementing, not competing with, more sustainable alternatives .<br><br>Yes, subsidies create market distortions, and we can certainly support reforming these policies to promote healthier options. However, access to calories remains a fundamental need, particularly for low-income individuals. Processed foods, in their diversity, provide a crucial safety net, offering a vital source of sustenance for those who might otherwise go without <br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The crux of today's debate is whether we prioritize immediate convenience via processed foods, or invest in the enduring well-being of people and the planet through sustainable systems. While the opposition champions increased reliance on processed foods, we've shown their approach is short-sighted, especially given their overly broad definition.<br><br>A truly sustainable system demands a holistic view, encompassing long-term health and environmental consequences. Prioritizing this is paramount; a system dependent on processed foods undermines sustainability's very foundation. We cannot claim to care about future generations while simultaneously condemning them to diets that increase health risks and an environment degraded by resource-intensive production.<br><br>The opposition has failed to address our core argument: that processed foods offer only a temporary, superficial solution to food access challenges. They act as a band-aid, masking systemic problems by diverting investment from sustainable alternatives. It is a false choice to suggest we cannot pursue these alternatives. As *the 2023 report by the Food and Agriculture Organization* indicates, innovation in regenerative agriculture and sustainable food production is already underway .<br><br>Therefore, we urge you to reject a vision of sustainability limited to the immediate. Instead, embrace a future where our food system supports both human and planetary health. Choose a future where food nourishes and sustains, rather than one that compromises our well-being and degrades our environment. Let's invest in a food system that truly sustains us, now and for generations to come.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the core question of whether processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. We firmly believe that increasing the role of processed foods is detrimental to overall sustainability. The first battleground centered on the definition of processed foods. While the opposition attempted to broaden the definition to include basic preservation. We maintain that this is an overly broad interpretation that deviates from expert consensus one. Established food science organizations such as the fda and usda define processed foods more specifically. By including nearly all foods under their definition. The opposition of voids addressing the real harms of highly processed foods. This leads us to the second key battle. The scope of sustainability. We have consistently argued for holistic sustainability. Which considers not only immediate needs but also long-term health and environmental consequences? The opposition's focus on short-term gains is myopic. As studies consistently demonstrate the detrimental long-term health impacts of diets high in processed foods.
