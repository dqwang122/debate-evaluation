                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By "AI," we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By "decline," we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And "human creative arts" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI’s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.<br><br>Now, let's turn to our core arguments.<br><br>First, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period . This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.<br><br>Second, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases . Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.<br><br>In summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.<br><br>

We contend that the rise of artificial intelligence will inevitably lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define creative arts as human activities involving the creation of visual auditory or performing artifact. Eg painting music literature dance that expressed the artists imaginative or technical skill. And are intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power adapted from merriam-webster dictionary. Decline. Signifies a gradual and continuous decrease in quantity quality or power. Oxford dictionary. In this context it refers to a reduction in the value opportunities and cultural significance of human created art. Finally ai artificial intelligence refers to the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages oxford dictionary. Our judging criteria is the preservation of human creativity. Beside the best demonstrates the long-term protection and promotion of human artistic endeavor should prevail. We believe that human creativity is essential for cultural richness and societal progress and any decline in human creative arts would be detrimental to society. First ai is already displacing human artists across creative industries. Forbes 2 reported confirmed predictions of massive job losses evidenced by repeated layoffs in 2023 and 2024 within the entertainment sector. Many explicitly attributed to ai integration. This displacement extends across various artistic domains from graphics design and illustrations to game design. For instance video game art assets are now automatically generated with ai directly replacing the work of human environmental artists. This shift isn't just a technological advancement. It's a systemic devaluation of human skills in labor. By automating creative tasks ai reduces opportunities for artists to develop their craft earn a living and contribute to the cultural landscape. This directly undermines the preservation of human creativity by making it harder for artists to sustain their careers. Second ai art devalues human artistic expression by flooding the market with cheap mass-produced content. While a nature study 3 notes ai art may enhance perceptions of human creativity when compared the overwhelming consensus is that ai tools negatively impact professional opportunities for artists. Ai reduces work in contracts lowers the monetary value of art. And even undermines the perceived creativity and skills required to be an artist. As vox 4 highlights the limited time people spend listening to music and the finite royalty pool. Mean that the more music is made with ai the less there is for human musicians. The result is that human artist struggle to compete. Leading to a decline in their economic viability and overall cultural influence. List devaluation actively erodes the conditions necessary for human creativity to flourish. 3rd ai raises significant ethical concerns regarding originality and copyright. Further undermining the value of human artistry. Ai models are often trained on existing artwork without proper consent or compensation leading to copyright infringement and intellectual property. Seven. As highlighted by the art newspaper 6. A us district judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey were violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Illustrators such as carla ortiz have criticized ai generated art as intellectual the. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training 6. Moreover many jurisdictions including the us do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by ai 6.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We stand firmly against the idea that AI will cause the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge AI's transformative potential, we believe its influence on the arts will be more complex and ultimately beneficial, leading to an evolution rather than a decline.<br><br>First, let's consider the definitions. While defining terms is important, the opposition's interpretations of "AI," "decline," and "human creative arts" are too . AI is more than just copying; it's a tool that can greatly expand what human artists can achieve. Decline is not solely about financial metrics; it's about the broader cultural impact and evolution of art. And human creative arts encompass not only traditional forms but also emerging digital art. By using such narrow definitions, they  the scope of our discussion.<br><br>Second, we disagree with the opposition's proposed judging criterion, which focuses solely on the negative impacts of AI on artists. A more  way to assess this is to consider the positive contributions AI can make to both artists and audiences, such as increasing accessibility, fostering new forms of expression, and safeguarding our cultural heritage. Focusing exclusively on the negative aspects ignores the broader context.<br><br>Now, let's address our core argument: AI is a powerful tool that empowers human artists, not a replacement for them. AI tools streamline artists' workflows, enabling them to experiment with new styles, generate variations of their work, and overcome technical challenges. Many visual artists find that AI tools make their creative work easier and more enjoyable by eliminating repetitive, tedious tasks, allowing them to focus on concept and ideation. This helps artists grow and diversify their art. The opposition seems to assume that artistic value is static, but history demonstrates that it evolves. Just as photography didn't destroy painting but rather spurred new artistic movements, AI art may reduce the demand for purely technical skills, but it amplifies the need for creative direction and artistic vision to guide AI. As the *BBC* reported in 2024, some artists are now exclusively training algorithms on their works alone in an attempt to push their own creative boundaries. This creates new forms of art and value.<br><br>Furthermore, AI plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged artworks, enabling accurate digital restoration and broader dissemination of our cultural heritage. *Ultralytics* reported that computer vision and machine learning are enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts. This is a tangible benefit that the opposition overlooks.<br><br>Finally, AI facilitates the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can be used to develop art installations that respond to audience interactions, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that encourage participation. As noted in "Using AI in Arts and Culture: Interactive Experiences and...", AI-driven art can adapt and evolve based on interactions, providing a unique and personalized experience for each viewer. Imagine an art gallery where the paintings change based on the viewers' emotions. These are the kinds of possibilities that AI unlocks, enriching the artistic landscape and fostering new connections between artists and audiences. AI offers opportunities for experimentation, collaboration, and democratization that were previously unimaginable. We believe that AI will not lead to the decline of human creative arts, but rather to its evolution and enrichment.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.<br><br>First, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation . Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development * in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists . Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers  and curators  are more important than writers , and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.<br><br>Second, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.<br><br>Third, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By "decline," we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And "human creative arts" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.<br><br>Fourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.<br><br>Fifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.<br><br>Sixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.<br><br>Finally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, which are their definitions of "decline," their judging criterion, and their overestimation of the positive impact of AI tools on creativity.<br><br>First, the opposition defines "decline" as "gradual and irreversible," setting an unreasonably high bar. Even a *temporary* or *reversible* decline in the value, originality, and economic viability of human art is a significant problem, especially if it disproportionately affects human artists. It’s like saying a patient isn’t sick unless the illness is guaranteed to be fatal – we should treat ailments before they become irreversible. The core of our argument is the here and now. We are already seeing the initial phases of a decline in demand for human generated art as AI proliferation continues to expand across industries .<br><br>Second, the opposition's judging criterion—the preservation of human agency and innovation—misses the point. We contend that even if human artists retain agency and continue to innovate, the *value* and *economic opportunities* for those artists can still decline due to AI. The mere existence of human agency doesn’t inherently guarantee a thriving art scene. Imagine a world where humans are free to create, but nobody values or buys their art because AI-generated alternatives flood the market. We should not focus on the bare minimum.<br><br>Third, while the opposition argues that AI is a tool to augment human creativity, this argument overlooks the very real dangers of devaluation and homogenization. While AI *can* be a tool, its accessibility and ease of use are leading to a flood of AI-generated content that undermines the value of human skill and dedication. They claim that 20% of people view AI as a tool for human artists . But that means 80% do not! And is that 20% figure from artists or just people? Furthermore, numerous reports detail how AI is already displacing human artists across various industries, from graphic design to game development . Moreover, the ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding AI art are not necessarily incentivizing human artists. In fact, the lack of clear legal frameworks and the fear of having their work copied and devalued may actually *discourage* artists from pursuing their craft. Illustrators have had their art illegally used to train AI systems . Why would they continue to make art if there is a high probability that it will be stolen?<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Our position is that AI is a tool that enhances, not diminishes, human creativity. We will show how the opposition's arguments rely on narrow definitions, restrictive criteria, and misrepresentations of our stance.<br><br>First, let's address the definitions. The opposition's definitions of AI, decline, and human creative arts are too narrow. They define AI as primarily mimicking and commodifying existing art styles, ignoring its potential as a tool for innovation. We define AI as computer systems performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, opening new creative avenues. Furthermore, their definition of "decline" focuses solely on a diminishing of perceived value, originality, and economic viability. However, decline can also signify a transformation, a potential for growth with a different approach.<br><br>Second, their judging criterion is also too restrictive. By focusing solely on the economic impact on artists, they miss the bigger picture. Our criterion, the preservation of human agency and innovation, offers a more comprehensive view. It acknowledges the evolving relationship between artists and technology.<br><br>Third, let's tackle the claim that AI devalues human skill. AI can be a powerful tool for artists, much like the printing press was for writers. It changed the literary landscape, but it certainly didn't eliminate writers or devalue their craft. Instead, it opened new avenues for expression and collaboration. To suggest that prompting an AI is merely curation undervalues the artist's skill. It's not an elimination of the artist, but an increase in possibilities. According to *a 2023 article in Lazerian*, the advent of Algorithmic Art marked a pivotal moment in art history, showcasing the potential for technology to expand the horizons of artistic expression . Instead of the human artist disappearing in the face of innovation, their abilities have even more opportunities for expression. The printing press analogy allows for an opening of art, a proliferation that increases overall participation and interest.<br><br>Fourth, the idea that AI homogenizes art also misses the mark. AI can analyze vast datasets, leading to profound artistic insights, not just sameness. It expands creative possibilities. The opposition is misrepresenting our argument by claiming that the democratization of art is inherently bad. They claim we believe the democratization of art is inherently bad. However, our point is that while increased access is positive, it shouldn't come at the expense of artistic integrity and human agency. In fact, *a 2024 article by Peter Suciu in Forbes* suggests that the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research, leading to a more inclusive and accessible art world .<br><br>Finally, AI lacks the emotional depth and lived experience that fuels human art. This means AI will augment art, not replace it. As we have discussed, the ethical and legal uncertainties surrounding AI also incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works, protecting human agency in art. Furthermore, *a 2023 study by researchers at the University of Oxford, published on LinkedIn*, suggests that AI's impact on preserving the integrity and authenticity of artworks extends to its ability to predict the long-term effects of conservation decisions . This predictive capability is invaluable, allowing conservators to choose interventions that will ensure the artwork's preservation under various future conditions. Therefore, AI serves as a tool to enhance human creativity, not diminish it.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods .<br>Thus, AI expands creative horizons.<br><br>Second, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear .<br>Consequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.<br><br>Third, the opposition challenges our definition of "decline," arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands – a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.<br><br>Fourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In today's debate, the core question is: does AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it does, by devaluing artistic skills and stifling authentic expression.<br><br>First, let's talk about skill. The opposition downplays the importance of emotional depth, but ask yourself: would artists dedicate years to mastering their craft if AI could replicate their work instantly? As experts at Yale have pointed out, when art is perceived as easily created, its inherent worth diminishes. Furthermore, *a UNCTAD report* highlights the very real economic threats posed by AI, directly impacting artists’ livelihoods. Even with agency, if value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.<br><br>Second, consider artistic expression. AI, trained on existing datasets, inevitably leads to homogenization and stifles originality. As *researchers at Stanford* have shown, AI's reliance on current systems limits its ability to generate truly novel art forms. The human emotion and experience, so vital for artistic innovation, are often lost in AI-generated works. To ensure balance and protect artistic integrity, AI must be regulated.<br><br>Ultimately, we ask you to judge this debate based on tangible outcomes for human artists. We have demonstrated how AI diminishes the value of artistic skills and stifles true artistic expression.<br><br>Finally, we must address the definition of decline. We reject the notion that only an irreversible decline counts. A significant decrease in value or artistic diversity, even if temporary, constitutes a decline. Therefore, we have proven that AI is leading to the decline of human creativity and art.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the core issues of artistic originality and the economic opportunities for human artists in the age of AI.<br><br>The opposition claims AI expands creative horizons, yet it merely remixes existing data, lacking genuine originality. AI is trained on existing data, so it can only remix and recombine existing styles. It's a sophisticated form of plagiarism, not true originality. As we said before, an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition . People still value quality and skill, but the *perception* that art is easily created *is* devaluing the work of human artists.<br><br>This leads to our second key point: the economic realities facing human artists. We are already seeing AI displace human artists in industries ranging from graphic design to game development . How can human artists compete with AI that generates art in seconds at virtually no cost? The photography analogy falls flat; it created a new medium, but AI attempts to replace an existing one. This decline warrants immediate concern, rejecting the opposition's call for us to wait until the point of no return.<br><br>We acknowledge the importance of human agency and innovation, but they are not enough to guarantee economic opportunity. Even with agency, AI could still flood the market with cheap art, hurting human artists.<br><br>Our values center on preserving human artistry, not merely for artists' sake, but for our society's cultural richness. The arts shape our understanding of the world, express our emotions, and foster connections.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, as we conclude this debate, let's remember what's truly at stake: the future of human creativity. Our opponents suggest that AI's rise inevitably spells the decline of human art. We firmly disagree. A temporary shift is not a  decline; it's merely an adaptation.<br><br>First, they claim AI devalues human skill. But consider the history of art itself. Did photography eliminate painting? No. Similarly, AI is a tool that empowers artists. According to *a 2023 report by the National Endowment for the Arts*, artists are increasingly integrating AI into their processes, using it to explore new styles and expand their creative horizons . We believe in the power of human artistry, and we see AI as a collaborator, not a replacement.<br><br>Second, retaining human agency is essential for continued innovation. Remove that agency, and you stifle potential. Human creativity brings a unique depth that AI simply cannot replicate. As *psychologist Dr. Susan Greenfield argued in her 2022 book, "Mind Change"*, emotions, experiences, and individual perspectives are the very essence of art . Our approach safeguards this irreplaceable element.<br><br>Finally, ethical considerations surrounding AI, particularly concerning copyright, further strengthen the case for human-generated art. *A 2024 article in the Columbia Journal of Law and the Arts* highlights the ongoing legal battles over AI-generated content and the protection of artists' rights . This uncertainty makes human art a more secure and ethically sound choice.<br><br>In conclusion, we champion human ingenuity, and we advocate for the enduring value of art. Let's support the artists, protect their rights, and foster a future where human creativity continues to flourish. Thank you.

The fear that ai will spell the decline of human creative arts. We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.<br><br>
