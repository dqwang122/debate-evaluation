                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that developed countries should impose a fat tax, defined as a tax or excise duty placed on foods with high levels of saturated fat, sugar, or salt to discourage consumption and improve public health.<br><br>Our judging criteria is utilitarianism: maximizing public health and societal welfare. We believe the side that demonstrably maximizes overall public health outcomes and minimizes the societal costs associated with diet-related diseases in developed countries should prevail.<br><br>First, a fat tax reduces the consumption of unhealthy foods. The core mechanism is simple: by increasing the price of unhealthy options, consumers are incentivized to choose healthier alternatives. Studies by the Imperial College Business School show that taxes on foods high in fat, salt, or sugar  demonstrably reduce their sale, purchase, and consumption . For instance, a 2012 study highlighted that a 20% tax on sugary drinks could reduce obesity levels by 3.5% in the US . Furthermore, a US study found that a 35% tax on sugar-sweetened drinks led to a 26% decline in sales within a canteen . These figures aren't just abstract percentages; they represent tangible shifts in dietary habits, moving populations away from harmful foods and towards healthier choices. Therefore, by making the unhealthy choice more expensive, a fat tax effectively steers consumers towards better dietary habits, leading to improved public health outcomes.<br><br>Second, a fat tax generates revenue for vital public health initiatives. This isn't simply about raising money; it's about strategically reinvesting resources to promote healthier lifestyles. The revenue generated can be directly allocated to subsidizing healthy food options, making them more accessible and affordable, particularly for lower-income communities. Moreover, these funds can fuel public education campaigns, raising awareness about the risks of unhealthy diets and promoting informed food choices. As an example, Kerala, India, implemented a 14.5% tax on fast foods sold by branded restaurants. The revenue was intended for public health initiatives, including promoting healthy eating habits . This illustrates the potential for fat tax revenue to be channeled directly into programs that encourage healthier behaviors. Consequently, the revenue generated transforms from a mere tax into a powerful tool for improving public health infrastructure and promoting healthier communities.<br><br>Third, a fat tax addresses the substantial societal costs of obesity and diet-related diseases. Obesity isn't just a personal issue; it's a significant drain on public resources. The Lancet reported that the costs to society resulting from obesity and other diet-related diseases are immense, including health-care costs, sickness absence, welfare payments, and lost tax revenue . These costs are borne by society as a whole, through higher taxes, reduced productivity, and an overburdened healthcare system, as highlighted by the National Institutes of Health . By implementing a fat tax, we are internalizing these costs, making consumers more aware of the true price of their unhealthy choices. The goal is not to punish individuals, but to create a system where the costs associated with unhealthy diets are more accurately reflected in the price of food. Ultimately, this encourages more responsible consumption and reduces the burden on society as a whole.<br><br>In conclusion, a fat tax is a vital tool for promoting public health in developed countries. By reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods, generating revenue for public health initiatives, and addressing the societal costs of obesity, it creates a healthier and more sustainable future for all. We urge you to support this motion.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the proposition that developed countries should impose a fat tax. To ensure clarity, we acknowledge the opposition's definition of a fat tax as a tax on foods high in saturated fat, sugar, or salt, designed to discourage consumption and boost public health. However, our core objection goes beyond this definition.<br><br>First, we challenge the utilitarian argument often used to support fat taxes. While public health is undoubtedly important, it cannot be the only factor guiding policy. A purely utilitarian approach risks trampling individual rights and disproportionately harming vulnerable populations. We believe just policy must balance the well-being of the many with the rights of the individual. We advocate for a rights-based approach, which prioritizes individual autonomy and equal access to resources. Under this framework, a fat tax is problematic because it infringes on the rights of low-income individuals to access affordable nutrition.<br><br>Second, we don't have to guess at the consequences of a fat tax. We can learn from the failure of the Danish experiment. As *PubMed Central* reported in *2013*, Denmark introduced a fat tax in 2011 but repealed it less than 12 months later . Consumers switched to cheaper brands, crossed borders to shop, and the administrative costs were high.<br><br>Third, let's address the central issue: the disproportionate impact of fat taxes on low-income individuals. These taxes unfairly burden those with limited financial resources, making it harder to access necessary calories and nutrition. The opposition often overlooks the regressive nature of fat taxes. Lower-income individuals spend a larger percentage of their income on food and will be disproportionately burdened by these taxes. They may not be able to afford healthier alternatives and could be forced to consume even less nutritious food to stay within their budget. A study in *ScienceDirect* found that even small taxes on groceries, around 4%, significantly increase the risk of food insecurity for low-income families by over 3%, as reported in *2023* . This can exacerbate health inequalities rather than improve public health outcomes, contradicting the stated goal. Instead of expanding healthy choices, fat taxes can restrict the ability of vulnerable populations to afford food, healthy or not, which does not truly promote informed choices.<br><br>Fourth, the idea that a fat tax is a valuable public health tool oversimplifies dietary behavior. Obesity is a multifaceted issue influenced by socioeconomic status, education, and lifestyle choices, which a tax cannot resolve. It penalizes specific food items without addressing the underlying causes of unhealthy diets. Emphasizing personal responsibility, education, and accessible healthy choices is a better approach.<br><br>Finally, fat taxes risk fueling a culture of moral judgment and shame around food, exacerbating anxiety and disordered eating. Creating a punitive atmosphere around food choices can have detrimental effects on mental health and well-being.<br><br>In conclusion, while we acknowledge the importance of promoting public health, we believe that fat taxes are not the answer. They unfairly burden low-income individuals, divert attention from more effective solutions, and risk creating a harmful culture around food. Let us invest in education and accessible resources so that all members of our society can flourish, not through punitive measures, but through empowerment.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains five critical flaws: their rejection of utilitarianism, their misrepresentation of the Danish fat tax experiment, their claim that fat taxes disproportionately harm low-income individuals, their assertion that fat taxes oversimplify dietary behavior, and their concern about creating a culture of moral judgment around food.<br><br>First, they reject utilitarianism, arguing for a "rights-based approach." However, we contend that maximizing public health, the very essence of utilitarianism, inherently protects and promotes individual rights. A healthier population is a more empowered population, better equipped to exercise their rights and contribute to society. Moreover, their "rights-based" approach lacks a concrete framework for measuring policy effectiveness, unlike our utilitarian approach which is focused on public health outcomes .<br><br>Second, they cite the "failure" of the Danish fat tax. However, this is a gross oversimplification. While Denmark repealed the tax, studies from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food show the tax *did* have a positive impact on the nation’s health . The tax's repeal was due to administrative burdens, political opposition, and cross-border shopping, issues of implementation, not a failure of the underlying principle . Moreover, Kerala, India, implemented a 14.5% tax on fast foods sold by branded restaurants. The revenue was intended for public health initiatives, including promoting healthy eating habits . The results show that the fast food purchase ratio in Kerala decreased by 3.9 percentage points, compared with 9 major cities . This illustrates that a fat tax, when implemented strategically, can be effective.<br><br>Third, they claim fat taxes disproportionately harm low-income individuals. While it's true that lower-income individuals spend a larger percentage of their income on food, this argument ignores the crucial fact that revenue from fat taxes can be directly allocated to subsidizing healthy food options, making them more accessible and affordable, particularly for lower-income communities . Furthermore, a ScienceDirect study found that small taxes on groceries significantly increase the risk of food insecurity for low-income families. It’s important to highlight that this study looks at *general* grocery tax, not a fat tax specifically .<br><br>Fourth, they assert that a fat tax oversimplifies dietary behavior. We never claimed a fat tax is a singular, complete solution. It's one tool in a broader strategy that includes education, and increased access to healthy choices . These are complementary measures, not mutually exclusive. The revenue generated from a fat tax can be used to enhance nutrition education programs and increase access to healthy food choices. We argue that education and access to healthy options are equally impacted by socioeconomic status and education, so fat tax isn't necessarily worse in this case .<br><br>Finally, they express concern about creating a culture of moral judgment around food. We are implementing a pragmatic measure to promote public health, not a moral judgment on individual choices . Many products, like tobacco and alcohol, are taxed without creating widespread moral panic. There is a moral judgment and shame associated with food and weight now, so the fat tax is no different . The costs to society resulting from obesity and other diet-related diseases are immense—in terms of health-care costs, sickness absence, welfare payments, and lost tax revenue . The aim is not to punish, but to encourage healthier choices and offset the societal costs of unhealthy diets.<br><br></div>

We’ve heard some interesting points, but we need to set the record straight on why a fat tax is not the right approach for developed countries. It's a flawed solution that creates more problems than it solves.<br><br>First, let’s address their claims about low-income families. They argue that a fat tax is manageable because the revenue will subsidize healthy food. However, this argument fails to acknowledge the immediate and disproportionate burden such a tax places on those with the fewest resources. As *Healthy People 2030* points out, people without access to grocery stores with healthy foods are less likely to have good nutrition, raising their risk of health conditions. A fat tax exacerbates this problem by limiting access to affordable calories and nutrition. Instituting a fat tax could hurt those in lower-income households as many of them rely on the cheaper, less healthy foods that would be taxed under such a policy. Since these households typically spend a significant portion of their total income on food, they would not only be unable to afford the healthier foods but they would also be forced to pay more for the foods that they could afford. This isn't just about economics; it's about infringing on the rights of individuals to secure basic nutrition.<br><br>Second, let's examine their promise of revenue for healthy food. They assume governments will efficiently allocate fat tax revenue to subsidize healthy options. But history is filled with instances of good intentions gone awry. Imagine if the fat tax revenue was diverted to a poorly designed education program that few people attended. This could waste the taxpayers' money. Moreover, even with the best intentions, the administrative costs associated with implementing and managing such a system can be substantial. As *PMC* highlights, despite evidence on the effectiveness of economic incentives in modifying dietary behavior, policy adoptions remain scarce, in part due to concerns about the unintended consequences and opposition from the food industry. This *PMC* study highlights that fat tax will fail because of the unintended consequences. The focus on subsidies also overlooks the importance of education and cultural factors that influence dietary choices.<br><br>Third, they suggest a fat tax is just one tool in a broader strategy. But this is like saying a hammer is a great tool for building a house when you only have nails. Obesity is a multifaceted issue influenced by cultural norms, personal preferences, and socioeconomic factors. As *Eufic* explains, what people eat is formed and constrained by circumstances that are essentially social and cultural. A fat tax unfairly targets specific food items without addressing these underlying issues. The claim that fat taxes effectively encourage healthier choices commits a *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy: correlation does not equal causation. Just because healthier choices follow the implementation of a fat tax does not mean the tax caused the change.<br><br>Now, let's revisit individual rights. They claimed a healthier population empowers individual rights. While a healthy population is important, we cannot trample on individual liberties to get there. There needs to be a balance.<br><br>Finally, remember Denmark? Their fat tax failed. Consumers switched to cheaper, untaxed options. The administrative costs were too high. These are practical problems that outweigh any theoretical benefits.<br><br>In conclusion, while the intention to improve public health is admirable, a fat tax is not the answer. It unfairly burdens low-income individuals, relies on unrealistic promises about government efficiency, and ignores the complexities of dietary behavior. We need solutions that empower, not punish, and that address the root causes of unhealthy eating habits.<br><br>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals fail to address the fundamental flaws in their argument for a fat tax. We will address their points in turn, demonstrating why our rights-based approach is superior and why a fat tax remains a misguided policy.<br><br>First, the opposition claims maximizing public health inherently protects individual rights, a core tenet of utilitarianism. However, this is a dangerous oversimplification. Utilitarianism, in its pursuit of the "greatest good," can easily justify sacrificing the rights of individuals or minority groups for the perceived benefit of the majority . Our rights-based approach, while also valuing public health, ensures that individual autonomy and equal access to resources are not trampled in the name of some aggregate benefit. Furthermore, a right-based approach provides a legal framework rooted in both national and international laws and policies which creates a concrete framework for measuring policy effectiveness.<br><br>Second, the opposition attempts to downplay the failure of the Danish fat tax, citing administrative issues. However, these "implementation" problems are not mere technicalities; they are fundamental flaws inherent in the design of such a tax. As *Course Sidekick* reports, the fat tax led to increased costs for consumers, potential backlash from the food industry, and, ultimately, did not effectively reduce unhealthy eating habits . Moreover, the example of Kerala, India, is irrelevant. Developed countries have vastly different dietary habits, cultural contexts, and economic structures compared to Kerala. Applying the results from a tax on *branded* fast food in India to a broad fat tax in a developed nation is a gross overreach.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that revenue from fat taxes can be used to subsidize healthy food. However, this is a promise, not a guarantee. Implementing effective subsidy programs is fraught with logistical challenges, potential for corruption, and bureaucratic inefficiencies. Even if subsidies are implemented, the initial tax still places a disproportionate burden on low-income individuals, forcing them to make impossible choices between affordability and nutrition. The ScienceDirect study we cited, while focused on general grocery taxes, still provides compelling evidence of the negative impact of such taxes on food security for low-income families .<br><br>Fourth, the opposition admits that a fat tax is only "one tool in a broader strategy." This concession is telling. It acknowledges that a fat tax, by itself, is insufficient to address the complex issue of dietary behavior. While the opposition might advocate for education and increased access to healthy food, like fat taxes, these approaches also have shortcomings. Socioeconomic status, cultural norms, and personal preferences also impact public health and must be accounted for .<br><br>Finally, the opposition dismisses concerns about a culture of moral judgment around food. However, we cannot ignore the potential for a fat tax to exacerbate food-related anxiety and disordered eating. Furthermore, it is incorrect to claim that taxes on tobacco and alcohol haven't created moral panic. There is undeniable social stigma and judgment associated with these products, which can lead to further social division and shame .<br><br>In conclusion, the opposition has failed to demonstrate that a fat tax is a just or effective policy. It infringes on individual rights, disproportionately harms low-income individuals, and risks creating a harmful culture around food. We urge you to reject this misguided proposal and embrace our rights-based approach that prioritizes individual autonomy and empowers individuals to make informed choices.<br><br>
