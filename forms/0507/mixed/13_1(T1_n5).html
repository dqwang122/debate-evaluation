                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss whether pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. To ensure clarity, "young adults" refers to individuals aged 18 to 25 from all socioeconomic backgrounds. "Beneficial" means providing significant advantages in career opportunities, financial stability, personal growth, and social mobility, while acknowledging the challenges of student debt. "Today's society" encompasses our current economic, technological, and social environment. And finally, a "four-year college degree" signifies a bachelor's degree from an accredited institution.<br><br>Now, let’s move on to why we firmly believe a four-year college degree is indeed beneficial. I will present three key arguments supporting this stance.<br><br>First, a college degree significantly boosts lifetime earnings, leading to greater financial security. It's not just about getting a job; it's about building a financially secure future. According to the *Social Security Administration*, men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more in median lifetime earnings than high school graduates, and women with bachelor's degrees earn $630,000 more . This increased earning potential acts as a substantial buffer against economic hardship. Higher earnings translate to more opportunities for homeownership, investments, and a comfortable retirement. It provides a safety net during unexpected financial challenges. Therefore, a college degree is a tangible investment in long-term financial well-being.<br><br>Second, college graduates are better equipped to adapt to changing job market demands through continuous learning and skill development. The job market today is rapidly evolving, with new technologies and industries emerging constantly. College provides a solid foundation for continuous learning. It equips graduates with critical thinking and problem-solving skills, enabling them to navigate career transitions and remain competitive. As highlighted in research from *PMC*, students make substantial gains in critical thinking during college . The critical thinking skills developed in college, such as problem-solving and analytical reasoning, enable graduates to adapt to new technologies and industries, remaining competitive in a rapidly changing job market. Furthermore, *the Journal for Labour Market Research* indicates that university graduates earn, on average, up to CHF 20,000 more per year than those with professional education degrees, highlighting the long-term wage advantage conferred by a broader academic skillset . Therefore, a college education is an investment in your long-term professional success.<br><br>Third, college promotes a more inclusive and equitable society by providing opportunities for individuals from diverse backgrounds. Higher education can help level the playing field and create a more just and equitable society by providing access to opportunities for all. College fosters diversity and inclusivity, exposing students to different perspectives and promoting social mobility.<br><br>In conclusion, a four-year college degree remains a valuable investment for young adults in today's society. It leads to greater financial security, equips graduates with the skills to adapt to the changing job market, and promotes a more inclusive and equitable society. Let's continue to support policies that make college accessible and affordable for all young adults. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that pursuing a 4-year college degree is no longer universally beneficial for young adults in today's society. We define beneficial as producing good results or helpful effects and being advantageous. We consider young adults to be individuals between the ages of 18 and 25. Today's society refers to the current socio-economic and technological environment. Are judging criteria is opportunity cost and return on investment. We believe the winning side will demonstrate the greatest return on investment. And minimize opportunity cost for young adults. Roi should be calculated by assessing the financial investment. Tuition fees lost wages. Versus potential earnings job security and career advancement opportunities. Opportunity cost includes alternative career paths skill development options and entrepreneurial ventures that young adults may forgo by pursuing a four-year degree. First the rising cost of education outweighs the potential earnings for many fields. The financial burden of a 4-year degree has become increasingly unsustainable. Tuition costs have sky. Leading to crippling student loan debt for many graduates the college board reports that the average cost of tuition and fees for the 2023 2024 school year. Was 11,260 at 4 year public colleges for in-state students. And 41,420 at private nonprofit colleges. Meanwhile according to a study by georgetown university center on education and the workforce. 40% of bachelor's degree holders earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. This disparity highlights a critical issue. The investment in a four-year degree does not guarantee a commensurate financial return. Especially in fields like humanities and social sciences. Leaving many graduates with a negative roi and a mountain of debt. Second skills-based training and vocational programs offer a faster and more direct route to employment in high demand industries. The modern job market increasingly values specific practical skills over broad theoretical knowledge. According to a manpower group survey 69% of employers globally are struggling to find workers with the right skills. Vocational programs in skills-based training provide targeted education and hands-on experience leading to quicker job placement and higher earning potential in fields like technology healthcare and skilled trades. For example a coding bootcamp can equip an individual with the skills to become a software developer in a matter of months allowing them to enter the workforce much faster. And with significantly less debt than a traditional computer science graduate. This direct pathway to employment addresses the skills gap. And provides a more efficient use of time and resources for young adults. 3rd degree inflation devalues the four year degree. Creating unnecessary barriers to entry level positions. Employers are increasingly requiring a 4-year degree for positions that do not inherently need one. A phenomenon known as degree inflation. A harvard business school study found that many middle skills jobs now stipulate. A college degree. As a minimum requirement. Even though only a third of the adults holding those positions possess one for. This artificial credential creates an unnecessary barrier to entry for individuals with valuable skills and experience. Acquired through alternative educational path. Or on-the-job training. It also forces young adults to incur unnecessary debt for a credential that does not guarantee better job performance or career advancement. According to test gorilla only 7% of the world's population holds a bachelor's degree 5.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">To quickly summarize our rebuttal, we will address the opposition's key concerns, reinforcing that a college degree offers enduring advantages beyond immediate financial returns.<br><br>First, the opposition makes a broad claim that a four-year college degree is no longer universally beneficial. However, this is a hasty generalization. While alternative paths certainly have value, a college education still offers significant advantages in career opportunities and overall growth for most young adults. The opposition fails to acknowledge that college provides invaluable networking opportunities. To ensure that individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds, including low-income and first-generation college students, have the resources to succeed, *the U.S. Department of Education* has Federal TRIO Programs in place.<br><br>Second, they judge the worth of college solely on ROI and opportunity cost. But education offers critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and personal growth. These intangible benefits are difficult to quantify, but they have a large impact. As *Collegenp* reported in 2024, educators emphasize fostering critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability in students to prepare them for a dynamic workforce. The narrow focus on ROI misses the broader societal benefits, like informed citizens and increased social mobility.<br><br>As we discussed in our opening statement, a college degree significantly boosts lifetime earnings. According to *research from PMC*, men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $896,000 more and women earn $630,000 more than high school graduates over a 50-year period. This increased earning potential provides long-term financial security that far outweighs the initial investment.<br><br>The opponent argues that rising costs outweigh potential earnings, but this ignores the long-term earning potential a degree unlocks. Plus, the argument that all wages are stagnant is misleading. Many specialized professions require knowledge gained through higher education that generate higher wages. Furthermore, policies promoting affordable tuition, expanding access to financial aid, and encouraging responsible borrowing can mitigate these challenges.<br><br>College also equips graduates to adapt to the changing job market. It provides a solid foundation for continuous learning and develops critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Adaptability is key, and a college education cultivates it. As highlighted in *a 2023 study*, critical thinking equips individuals with the ability to analyze complex information, discern credible sources, and make informed decisions, which is essential in today's rapidly evolving job market.<br><br>Opponents suggest skills-based training is better, but vocational programs can become obsolete. A college degree provides a broader base for continuous learning. It allows graduates to adapt to new technologies and career shifts throughout their lives. Moreover, college graduates demonstrate greater career resilience compared to those with only vocational training.<br><br>Furthermore, college promotes a more inclusive and equitable society by providing opportunities for all. It helps level the playing field, fostering diversity, and promoting social mobility.<br><br>Finally, while degree inflation is a concern, it doesn't negate the fundamental value of a college education. A degree still signifies knowledge, critical thinking, and commitment that employers seek. A college degree remains a valuable investment. As *a 2021 report* indicates, despite rising costs and student debt, the long-term financial benefits of a four-year college degree remain indisputable, leading to better economic outcomes and wealth accumulation.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal fails to address the core issues we raised. Their arguments contain several flaws, specifically regarding their judging criteria, their unsubstantiated claims about networking, their misleading statistics on lifetime earnings, their misunderstanding of adaptability, and their inadequate response to the problem of degree inflation.<br><br>First, the opposition argues for a vague notion of "societal benefit" as a primary criterion, but this is far too subjective and immeasurable. We maintain that Return on Investment and Opportunity Cost are the superior metrics because they offer a tangible and concrete way to evaluate the true value of a four-year degree for young adults. What good is a "societal benefit" when an individual is saddled with debt and limited career prospects? Intangible benefits, such as critical thinking and problem solving, are not exclusive to college; they can also be acquired through vocational training, entrepreneurship, and real-world experiences. While college may promote social mobility, so too do successful vocational programs and entrepreneurial ventures. The focus must remain on what provides the best individual outcome, not a nebulous societal good .<br><br>Second, the affirmative presents the existence of Federal TRIO programs as sufficient evidence that college provides networking opportunities and resources for disadvantaged students. However, they fail to provide any actual evidence that these programs are broadly successful. The reality is that many disadvantaged students still struggle to navigate the college system, and the reach of TRIO programs is limited. Networking opportunities are not exclusive to college campuses; they are readily available through professional organizations, online communities, and industry events, often at a fraction of the cost .<br><br>Third, the opposition's claims about increased lifetime earnings are misleading. While some graduates may earn more over their lifetimes, this is heavily dependent on their field of study. Many college graduates, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. Furthermore, they completely ignore the opportunity cost of lost wages during the four years spent in college, as well as the burden of student loan debt, which can significantly impact long-term financial well-being . The affirmative's circular reasoning claims a college degree boosts lifetime earnings, which generates wealth accumulation; however, the reference for this claim comes from the same PMC report, making the argument flawed.<br><br>Fourth, the affirmative equivocates on the meaning of "adaptability." While a general education may provide a broad base of knowledge, vocational training offers immediately applicable skills and adaptability *within* a specific field, which is often more valuable in today's rapidly changing job market. The skills gap persists despite the increasing number of college graduates, demonstrating that a college degree does not automatically translate to job readiness. Instead of preparing graduates for specific jobs, colleges provide general skills that require additional training after graduation .<br><br>Fifth, and finally, the opposition fails to adequately address the growing problem of degree inflation. Multiple sources confirm that employers are increasingly requiring a four-year degree for positions that don't necessarily need one, creating unnecessary barriers to entry-level jobs . This trend forces young adults to incur unnecessary debt for a credential that does not guarantee better job performance or career advancement, exacerbating inequality and hindering economic mobility.<br><br>In conclusion,<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We've explored today the crucial question of whether a four-year college degree remains a worthwhile pursuit for young adults. We firmly believe it absolutely does.<br><br>While the opposition focused on immediate gains, let's consider the long-term financial security a college degree provides. *The Social Security Administration reported in 2022* that men with bachelor's degrees earn approximately $900,000 more over their careers than those with only a high school diploma . Yes, tuition costs are a concern, but affordable tuition policies and increased financial aid can effectively address them. The long-term earning potential makes college a sound investment.<br><br>Furthermore, college cultivates adaptability, a crucial skill in today's rapidly changing job market. While vocational training offers specific skills, a college degree provides a broader foundation. *A 2019 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research* demonstrates that college graduates exhibit greater career resilience, adapting more readily to evolving job demands .<br><br>Moreover, college promotes a more inclusive society by expanding opportunities and fostering diversity. While some argue that degree inflation diminishes its value, a degree still signifies a commitment to knowledge, critical thinking, and perseverance. *The Association of American Colleges and Universities reported in 2020* that employers consistently prioritize these qualities when hiring new graduates .<br><br>In conclusion, a college degree remains a valuable investment, offering financial security, adaptability, and promoting inclusivity. We urge you to support policies that make college accessible to all. Let's continue to champion the enduring value of higher education.</div>

Our opponents champion the "societal benefits" of a four-year degree. However, we've demonstrated that skills-based training offers a more direct route to financial independence and career success. Remember to consider which side provides a better return on investment.<br><br>First, vocational programs provide immediate advantages. They equip individuals with in-demand, job-ready skills, leading to faster employment and greater earning potential than many four-year degrees. The ROI is undeniably superior.<br><br>Second, while our opponents claim college fosters adaptability, we argue that adaptability within a specific field is more valuable. Vocational training delivers precisely that, ensuring graduates are immediately employable with the specific skills employers need. They are not just knowledgeable but also job-ready.<br><br>Finally, our opponents have failed to address degree inflation adequately. The increasing demand for degrees, even for jobs that don't require them, forces young adults into unnecessary debt, hindering their financial future. As *Forbes magazine reported*, the often-cited statistic of $900,000 in lifetime earnings ignores the opportunity cost of four years in college, lost earnings, and accumulated debt.<br><br>Therefore, a vote for our side is a vote for fiscal responsibility, empowering young adults with practical skills for a debt-free future. It's a vote for economic freedom and a tangible return on investment. We urge you to support a path that prioritizes individual success. Thank you.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around whether a four-year college degree remains universally beneficial for young adults, and we firmly believe it is not.<br><br>The affirmative side asks you to prioritize a vague and immeasurable "societal benefit" when evaluating the worth of a college degree. We maintain that Return on Investment and Opportunity Cost are the superior metrics because they offer a tangible and concrete way to evaluate the true value of a four-year degree for young adults. What good is a "societal benefit" when an individual is saddled with debt and limited career prospects? Moreover, successful vocational programs and entrepreneurial ventures also promote social mobility .<br><br>The claim that college provides invaluable networking opportunities through programs such as Federal TRIO is not supported by evidence. The affirmative side fails to demonstrate the broad success of these programs. Networking opportunities are readily available through professional organizations and online communities, often at a fraction of the cost .<br><br>The opposition's claims about increased lifetime earnings are misleading. While some graduates may earn more over their lifetimes, this is heavily dependent on their field of study. Many college graduates, particularly those in the humanities and social sciences, earn less than the average high school graduate at some point in their careers. They also ignore the opportunity cost of lost wages during the four years spent in college, as well as student loan debt, which can significantly impact long-term financial well-being .<br><br>The affirmative equivocates on the meaning of "adaptability." While a general education may provide a broad base of knowledge, vocational training offers immediately applicable skills and adaptability *within* a specific field, which is often more valuable in today's rapidly changing job market.<br><br>
