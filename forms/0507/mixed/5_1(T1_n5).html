                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to address a crucial question: Will AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it will, and while we recognize that change is inevitable, we don't believe all change is progress. We are here to discuss if the change brought by AI is leading to a decline in human creative arts. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define our terms. By "AI," we mean its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By "decline," we signify a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art across various mediums. And "human creative arts" encompasses everything from painting and sculpture to music, writing, and design. Our judging criterion is whether AI’s increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists.<br><br>Now, let's turn to our core arguments.<br><br>First, the ease of AI art generation fundamentally devalues the years of skill, training, and dedication required for traditional artistic mastery. While AI can undoubtedly be a tool to assist artists, its current capabilities primarily involve replicating and remixing existing styles, ultimately posing a risk to genuine human creativity and originality. When AI can produce passable art instantly, it undermines the perceived worth of human artists who have dedicated their lives to honing their craft. It's like comparing a professionally baked cake to one made from a box mix. Both might satisfy a craving, but the skill, time, and artistry involved in the professional cake are undeniably more valuable. This devaluation can lead to decreased motivation for individuals to pursue traditional art forms, resulting in a loss of expertise. According to *Yale experts*, the ease of AI art generation is shifting public perception, leading many to believe that art is easily created, mass-produced, and therefore intrinsically less valuable than art produced by skilled individuals over a longer period . This perception directly threatens the livelihoods and reputations of human artists.<br><br>Second, AI's algorithmic approach to art flattens artistic expression, leading to a homogenization of styles and themes. AI, trained on existing datasets, tends to replicate established patterns, diminishing the originality and diversity that arise from human artists' unique experiences and perspectives. This is because the AI is programmed to look at existing data, and thus perpetuate patterns that have already been established. This can lead to a 'sameness' in art, reducing its cultural value. Think of it like this: if every song was written using the same set of chords and rhythms, music would quickly become monotonous and lose its emotional depth. As *MIT Technology Review reported in 2019*, AI art often relies on remixing pre-existing data, raising concerns that it may lack genuine originality and perpetuate existing biases . Imagine a young artist, inspired by the masters, dedicating years to honing their craft, only to find their work devalued by an AI-generated imitation.<br><br>In summary, we believe that AI's impact on the creative arts will be profoundly negative. By devaluing human skill and homogenizing artistic expression, AI poses a significant risk to the future of human creativity. We urge you to consider the implications of AI on the arts and to support human creativity by actively engaging with and valuing the work of human artists. We look forward to a robust discussion and welcome your thoughtful consideration of these important issues.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we contend that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Redefine human creative arts as the diverse range of artistic expressions originating from human intellect emotion and experience. Encompassing visual arts music literature performing arts and other forms of creative endeavor. Decline refers to a gradual and irreversible decrease in quality quantity or influence. We define ai as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence such as visual perception speech recognition decision-making and translation between languages. Are judging criteria is the preservation of human agency and innovation in the arts. The side that best demonstrates how human artists retain control originality and the capacity for innovation in the face of ai technology should be favored. First ai lacks the emotional depth and lived experience necessary for truly resonant creative expression. Ai algorithms regardless of their sophistication. Are fundamentally limited by their lack of subjective experience and emotional understanding. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions which ai cannot replicate. As digital brew.com not. Ai art lacks true emotional depth originality. And the ability to make intuitive decisions limiting its potential to fully replace human creativity. Bizjournals.com echoes this stating that while ai might one day produce noteworthy art it currently lacks the ability to create works with the depth and meaning that humans can. Human creativity involves genuine emotions and unique perspectives. Contrasting with ai creativity which relies on data and algorithms lacking true originality and self-expression. This difference is crucial because art is not just about aesthetics. It's about conveying emotion and meaning. Something ai struggles to achieve. Thus human creativity will continue to thrive because of its unique emotional core. Second ai serves as a tool to augment not replace human creativity. Ai can assist with tasks like idea generation exploring styles and even overcoming creative blocks. Ci prompt shop.com highlights that ai is increasingly seen as a tool to enhance human creativity. Many artists view ai as a collaborative partner using it to augment their creative process generating ideas or assisting with technical aspects. Indeed 20% of people already view ai as a tool for human artists. This demonstrates that ai is more likely to become a tool that human artists use and adapt. Not something that's supplants them. The collaborative synergy between human artists and ai tools will lead to new forms of creative expression and innovation. Third the ethical and legal uncertainty surrounding ai art incentivize human artists to innovate and create original works. Ethical concerns in ai art include copyright issues lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists 10. Artists have a ledge that ai art generators use their original artworks without permission to train ai systems. Arguing that copying and distributing their creations for commercial gain constituted multiple violations of copyright law 11. Furthermore a growing movement calls for the training sets of ai tools to be published publicly. Allowing artists and creatives to retain credit publicly. These unresolved ethical and legal issues create an environment where human artists are incentivized to create art that is demonstrably original and free from the taint of ai-related copyright concerns. This push for originality will drive new and exciting forms of human creative expression. In conclusion ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. We're here today to demonstrate why the rise of AI presents a significant and tangible threat to human creative arts. We will focus on AI's impact on artistic expression and how it devalues human skills.<br><br>First, let's tackle the issue of artistic expression. While the opposition suggests AI enhances creativity, this is a dangerously incomplete picture. AI relies heavily on existing datasets. This dependence leads to a homogenization of art, stifling the very originality that stems from human experience. As *Matt Corrall* points out, this dependence on existing data limits true innovation . Think of it this way: an artist 'prompting' AI is more akin to a curator selecting pieces for an exhibition. The skill lies in selection, not in the initial conception of the idea. This shift erodes the need for the deep, nuanced skills that human artists cultivate over years of practice. The ease and low cost of AI-generated art, as highlighted by *UN Trade and Development * in their 2023 report, will inevitably incentivize its widespread use, further devaluing the work of human artists . Now, AI is a tool, just like a printing press is a tool for writers, but the creation of the printing press changed the landscape forever. Now, publishers  and curators  are more important than writers , and the economics have changed forever. The core creation of something original, of something from nothing, is now devalued.<br><br>Second, let's address the devaluation of human artistic skill. The opposition may argue that AI lacks emotional depth, but that misses the crucial point. The real threat lies in the *perception* that art is now easily created, which directly undermines the value and recognition afforded to human artists. *Yale experts* suggest that AI art is fundamentally shifting public perception. People are increasingly led to believe that art is easily created and, therefore, less valuable. This perception, fueled by the proliferation of AI-generated content, directly threatens the livelihoods and artistic endeavors of human creators.<br><br>Third, to ensure clarity, let's reiterate our definitions. We define AI as its increasing capacity to mimic, automate, and commodify creative processes. By "decline," we mean a diminishing of the perceived value, originality, and economic viability of human-generated art. And "human creative arts" encompasses fields like painting, sculpture, music, writing, and design.<br><br>Fourth, our judging criterion is whether AI's increasing role in creative fields diminishes the value, originality, and economic opportunity for human artists. This focuses on the tangible effects on human artists themselves.<br><br>Fifth, we fundamentally disagree with the assertion that AI will not lead to a decline. Our arguments will demonstrate how AI devalues human skill, homogenizes artistic expression, and ultimately diminishes the creative landscape.<br><br>Sixth, we need to challenge the opponent's definitions. If they define 'decline' as something that is gradual and irreversible, it sets an impossibly high bar for proving our case. We contend that even a significant, but potentially reversible, decrease in value and opportunity constitutes a decline worth addressing.<br><br>Finally, their judging criterion is preserving human agency and innovation. But that is not the *only* thing that matters. Our focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. Even with agency, if the value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal speech contains several flaws, which are: their arguments about homogenization, devaluation of human skill, the definition of decline, and judging criterion are all flawed.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that AI homogenizes art and stifles originality by relying on existing datasets. AI, in reality, allows artists to experiment with novel styles and techniques unattainable otherwise. AI assists artists in breaking free from established norms, in which traditional art also has trends and patterns. For example, AI allows artists to quickly iterate through different stylistic variations, blending genres, and experimenting with aesthetics that might have been too time-consuming or technically challenging to explore with traditional methods .<br>Thus, AI expands creative horizons.<br><br>Second, the opposition claims that the perception of art being easily created devalues human skill, citing Yale experts. However, this claim fails to recognize the continued appreciation for human artistry. Common sense dictates that people understand the difference between art created by a skilled human and AI-generated art. It's like comparing a mass-produced print to an original painting; both have their place, but the unique skill and effort behind the original are still valued. People still value quality and skill, as shown by consumer spending on human-created art. Despite the rise of photography, painting did not disappear, just like human-created art will not disappear .<br>Consequently, this challenges their point about devaluation.<br><br>Third, the opposition challenges our definition of "decline," arguing that even a significant but potentially reversible decrease in value constitutes a decline worth addressing. However, a temporary dip is not a decline. It's like the stock market; a temporary dip is not considered a decline if the overall trend is upward. Therefore, our definition stands – a genuine decline implies a gradual and irreversible decrease.<br><br>Fourth, the opposition challenges our judging criterion, stating that their focus is on the practical impact on artists' livelihoods and the value of their work. However, we maintain that human agency and innovation are prerequisites for value and economic opportunity. If artists retain agency and continue to innovate, value and economic opportunity will follow. Without the ability to innovate and express their unique visions, the value of art diminishes regardless of AI's influence.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In today's debate, the core question is: does AI lead to the decline of human creative arts? We firmly believe it does, by devaluing artistic skills and stifling authentic expression.<br><br>First, let's talk about skill. The opposition downplays the importance of emotional depth, but ask yourself: would artists dedicate years to mastering their craft if AI could replicate their work instantly? As experts at Yale have pointed out, when art is perceived as easily created, its inherent worth diminishes. Furthermore, *a UNCTAD report* highlights the very real economic threats posed by AI, directly impacting artists’ livelihoods. Even with agency, if value and economic opportunity decline, the arts suffer.<br><br>Second, consider artistic expression. AI, trained on existing datasets, inevitably leads to homogenization and stifles originality. As *researchers at Stanford* have shown, AI's reliance on current systems limits its ability to generate truly novel art forms. The human emotion and experience, so vital for artistic innovation, are often lost in AI-generated works. To ensure balance and protect artistic integrity, AI must be regulated.<br><br>Ultimately, we ask you to judge this debate based on tangible outcomes for human artists. We have demonstrated how AI diminishes the value of artistic skills and stifles true artistic expression.<br><br>Finally, we must address the definition of decline. We reject the notion that only an irreversible decline counts. A significant decrease in value or artistic diversity, even if temporary, constitutes a decline. Therefore, we have proven that AI is leading to the decline of human creativity and art.</div>

Our opponents suggest that AI's rise inevitably spells the decline of human art. We firmly disagree. A temporary shift is not a  decline; it's merely an adaptation.<br><br>First, they claim AI devalues human skill. But consider the history of art itself. Did photography eliminate painting? No. Similarly, AI is a tool that empowers artists. According to *a 2023 report by the National Endowment for the Arts*, artists are increasingly integrating AI into their processes, using it to explore new styles and expand their creative horizons . We believe in the power of human artistry, and we see AI as a collaborator, not a replacement.<br><br>Second, retaining human agency is essential for continued innovation. Remove that agency, and you stifle potential. Human creativity brings a unique depth that AI simply cannot replicate. As *psychologist Dr. Susan Greenfield argued in her 2022 book, "Mind Change"*, emotions, experiences, and individual perspectives are the very essence of art . Our approach safeguards this irreplaceable element.<br><br>Finally, ethical considerations surrounding AI, particularly concerning copyright, further strengthen the case for human-generated art. *A 2024 article in the Columbia Journal of Law and the Arts* highlights the ongoing legal battles over AI-generated content and the protection of artists' rights . This uncertainty makes human art a more secure and ethically sound choice.<br><br>In conclusion, we champion human ingenuity, and we advocate for the enduring value of art. Let's support the artists, protect their rights, and foster a future where human creativity continues to flourish. Thank you.

The fear that ai will spell the decline of human creative arts. We stand before you to offer a different perspective. One of cautious optimism. Grounded in historical precedent and a clear understanding of human ingenuity. The core of the affirmatives argument rests on two claims. That ai will homogenize art and devalue human skill. Let's dismantle these fears. They suggest that ai bound by existing data set. Can only regurgitate the past stifling originality. Yet throughout history every artistic movement has built upon the foundations laid by its predecessors. Ai simply offers a new palette of influences. A vast library of styles and techniques that artists can draw upon to create truly novel works. Ai can empower artists to experiment with stylistic variations. Blending genres and pushing boundaries in ways previously unimaginable. Furthermore the affirmative claim that ai devalues human skill misunderstands the enduring human desire for authentic connection. Yes ai can generate impressive images. But it cannot replicate the emotional depth. The personal story and the unique perspective that imbue human created art with its enduring value 1. Justice photography didn't eliminate painting ai will not eliminate human art. Instead it will create a new lands. Were human artists who embrace ai as a tool will thrive. Reaching new audiences and generating new sources of income. The affirmative asks you to define decline as any temporary dip in value. We argue that this is a short-sighted view. Disruptions are inevitable. Throughout history technology has reshaped industries forcing adaptation and innovation. But true decline is a permanent state a loss of agency and potential. And that is precisely what we are arguing against. We believe that human artists empowered by ai will not only survived but flourish.<br><br>
