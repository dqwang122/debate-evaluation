                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency, or CBDC, which we define as a digital form of a country's fiat currency, issued and regulated by the nation's central bank .<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing economic stability and growth. The optimal policy regarding a US CBDC is the one that best promotes long-term economic stability and sustainable growth for the United States.<br><br>First, a US CBDC enhances financial inclusion. Currently, millions of Americans are unbanked or underbanked, facing significant barriers to accessing basic financial services. A CBDC would provide a safe, reliable, and low-cost alternative, especially benefiting low-income households . Studies show that CBDCs can reduce barriers to financial inclusion and decrease transaction costs . By fostering competition in the payments market and enabling more direct transactions, a CBDC lowers the cost of financial services and makes them more accessible . This direct access to a digital form of central bank money reduces reliance on traditional banks and other intermediaries, thereby lowering costs and increasing convenience. For example, the implementation of a CBDC could reduce remittance costs for cross-border payments, which disproportionately affect low-income individuals who rely on these transfers . A CBDC bridges the financial gap, integrating marginalized populations into the formal economy, and fostering broader economic participation and stability.<br><br>Second, a US CBDC improves payment system efficiency and bolsters international competitiveness. The current payment systems often involve intermediaries, leading to delays and higher transaction costs. A CBDC would streamline transactions, enhancing the speed and security of payments, including cross-border transactions . Research indicates that CBDCs can enhance the speed of transactions and foster the safety and efficiency of domestic and cross-border payment systems . A US CBDC would also protect the dollar's status as the world’s reserve currency. In an era of increasing digital finance, a CBDC ensures that the United States remains at the forefront of financial innovation, maintaining its economic leadership . A CBDC provides a more efficient payment instrument . The strategic benefits of a CBDC significantly outweigh the challenges, making it crucial for maintaining US economic leadership . By streamlining transactions and reducing costs, a CBDC fosters sustainable economic growth and maintains the U.S.'s competitive edge in the global financial landscape.<br><br>Third, a US CBDC reduces illicit activities. The anonymity of cash makes it a preferred medium for illicit transactions, including money laundering and terrorist financing. A CBDC, with its enhanced traceability and transparency, would deter these activities . CBDCs can help prevent counterfeit currency and illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorist financing . CBDC data could increase traceability and transparency of transactions, which could deter illicit activity, and further criminal justice efforts . Unlike cash, every CBDC transaction can be tracked and monitored, providing law enforcement agencies with valuable tools to combat financial crime. This enhanced transparency not only deters illicit activities but also increases trust in the financial system. By reducing financial crime and increasing transparency, a CBDC strengthens economic stability and promotes a more secure financial environment.<br><br>In conclusion, the implementation of a US CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and reducing illicit activities, thereby maximizing economic stability and growth. We urge you to support the adoption of a US CBDC.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate our opponents laying out their arguments for a U.S. CBDC, which they define as a digital form of fiat currency, issued and regulated by the central bank.<br><br>However, we believe the debate needs a broader scope. While economic stability and growth are important, they aren't the only things we should care about. We must also consider individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power. We must not sacrifice liberty for the sake of marginal economic gains.<br><br>First, a central bank digital currency could enable the government to directly monitor and control citizens' spending habits. A CBDC creates a direct link between the central bank and individual transactions. It lacks the privacy protections offered by cash and could enable mass surveillance of financial activity. Without strong privacy safeguards, every transaction is inherently traceable. Imagine: every purchase you make, every bill you pay, tracked and recorded by the government. This level of scrutiny could allow the government to monitor and control your spending habits, raising serious concerns about financial freedom and personal autonomy. As stated in a *2024 IMF policy brief*, a CBDC could be perceived as an instrument for state surveillance, undermining public trust in central bank money . This is a particular concern given the existing vulnerabilities in government data security.<br><br>Second, a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the entire financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks and technical glitches. Concentrating all digital currency operations within the central bank's system increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack or system failure, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC would create a single, even larger target. In 2016, hackers stole $81 million from the Bangladesh central bank's account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, demonstrating the vulnerability of even highly secure financial systems. According to *ScienceDirect*, any disruption in the CBDC system could affect the operation of wholesale and retail payment infrastructures, causing financial shocks . The *America First Policy* also highlights the risks, noting that data privacy and cybersecurity are foundational to the modern financial world, and the risks presented to America’s economy from cyberattacks and hacking cannot be overstated . Furthermore, a *2023 report* emphasizes that the financial industry is experiencing a notable increase in the frequency, sophistication, and severity of cyber attacks against financial institutions. Promoting current options for banking helps avoid this concentration because they are diversified across many institutions, which decentralizes the system and provides safeguards against tyranny. While proponents suggest future safeguards can mitigate these risks, history demonstrates that even the most sophisticated security measures are eventually breached. The potential for government surveillance and a catastrophic system failure outweighs the marginal gains in efficiency or financial inclusion that a CBDC might offer.<br><br>Third, the development and maintenance of a CBDC would impose significant costs on taxpayers without guaranteed benefits. The infrastructure, security, and ongoing management of a CBDC require substantial public investment, which may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency or welfare. These costs would ultimately be borne by taxpayers, making it essential to carefully consider whether the potential benefits of a CBDC justify the financial burden. The *Bank Policy Institute* points out that there are currently no estimates of what it would cost to develop or implement a CBDC .<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, pertaining to privacy, cybersecurity, and cost.<br><br>First, the opposition raises concerns about government surveillance, suggesting a CBDC inherently sacrifices privacy . However, this argument ignores the *design principles* of a responsible CBDC. CBDCs can be designed with privacy-by-design principles, integrating robust security measures and giving users control over their data . Regulations can ensure a balance between security and privacy . Modern digital payment systems *already* possess tracking capabilities . Therefore, a CBDC doesn't fundamentally alter the existing landscape; it simply offers a more efficient platform. Further, the specter of government overreach loses its sting when we remember that a stable economy—something a CBDC is designed to promote—is the surest bulwark against authoritarianism .<br><br>Second, our opponents claim that a CBDC creates a single point of failure, making the financial system vulnerable to cyberattacks . However, this overlooks the potential for *decentralized ledger technology* in CBDC design . DLT distributes data across multiple nodes, eliminating the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing security . This architecture can be *more* resilient than traditional centralized databases, which are also subject to cyberattacks, as demonstrated by the alarming 330% increase in attacks on financial institutions between 2019 and 2023 . Experts in CBDC security design emphasize cryptography and robust cybersecurity measures, continuously adapting to emerging threats, including quantum computing . Therefore, the argument that a CBDC is inherently more vulnerable is simply inaccurate.<br><br>Third, the opposition argues that a CBDC imposes significant costs on taxpayers . While development costs are undeniable, focusing solely on initial investment ignores the potential for long-term cost savings and economic benefits. Comparative analyses show that CBDCs, particularly those designed with private sector involvement, can potentially lower transaction costs compared to traditional payment systems . The successful implementation of CBDCs in countries like the Bahamas, Jamaica, and Nigeria demonstrates the feasibility of cost savings and improved financial inclusion . Moreover, a US CBDC could enhance financial inclusion, lower transaction costs, and maintain the dollar's global role . The cost of *not* innovating and ceding leadership in the digital finance space is a far greater risk than any initial investment.<br><br>In conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on exaggerated fears and a failure to consider the potential benefits and design safeguards of a US CBDC. We maintain that implementing a CBDC is essential for enhancing financial inclusion, improving payment system efficiency, and promoting economic stability and growth.<br><br></div>

Esteem judges ladies and gentlemen the affirmatives rebuttals fail to adequately address the core concerns surrounding a us cbdc. They attempt to assuage our concerns about privacy cybersecurity and costs but their arguments are ultimately unconvincing. First let's address the judging criteria. The affirmative insists on maximizing economic stability and growth as the sole measure of success. We argue that this is a dangerously narrow view as the risks of central bank digital currency in the united states. The implementation of central bank digital currencies as the primary medium of exchange would exacerbate the flaws of our current fiat system. True progress isn't just about boosting gdp. It's about safeguarding fundamental rights. Even if a cbdc offers a marginal economic benefit. The potential cost to individual liberty and financial freedom outweighs any supposed gain. History is replete with examples where prioritizing economic growth at all costs led to authoritarianism and societal harm. Are we willing to sacrifice our freedom on the altar of economic efficiency. Second the affirmative claims that privacy by design will eliminate our concerns about government surveillance. This is simply not realistic. As studies mentioned privacy concerns for central bank digital currency in the us including mass surveillance. Cybersecurity risks and potential data misuse. While privacy protection is a key design feature being considered. The promise of secure data handling doesn't erase the inherent risk of centralized data collection. As cited in the risks of central bank digital currency in the united states a cbdc does not offer any unique benefit to the american people. But it does post serious risks to financial privacy freedom markets and cybersecurity. Data breaches occur even with the most sophisticated security measures. Furthermore we reject the argument that because current digital payment systems possess tracking capabilities. We should accept more traceability in the hands of the government. That's like saying because petty theft exists we should legalize grand larceny. The government's ability to monitor every transaction. Create a chilling effect on free expression and opens the door to potential abuse. Third the affirmative touts the security of decentralized ledger technology as a solution to cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While dlt offers potential benefits it's not a silver bullet. And security risks include data breaches fraud and attacks on central bank digital currency systems 5. Excited by the source above these systems must be safeguarded against evolving threats and quantum computing poses a new risk to encryption and central banks face security challenges in deploying cbdc. Successful attacks on cryptocurrency exchanges and other dlt based systems. Demonstrate that these technologies are not immune to hacking. Moreover the affirmative ignores the fact that traditional financial systems have benefited from decades of security investments and hardening. A nascent dlt based cbdc would lack this crucial foundation. Making it a prime target for cyber criminals. Finally the affirmative points to the successful implementation of cbdcs in the bahamas jamaica and nigeria. As evidence of their viability. With all due respect. These are vastly different economic contexts in the united states. What works in a small island nation with limited financial infrastructure may not scale effectively or safely? In a complex technologically advanced economy like ours. As the bank policy institute points out there are currently no reliable estimates of the true cost of developing and implementing a us cbdc. The alternative to central bank digital currency in the us include stable coins and intermediated cbdc models.<br><br>

We will address their main points, and then reinforce our core arguments against a US CBDC.<br><br>First, let's be clear: this isn't just about economic efficiency. Individual privacy, financial freedom, and the potential for abuse of power are crucial considerations. We cannot sacrifice liberty for marginal economic gains. The opponent may cite reports suggesting CBDCs can be designed with privacy in mind, but we must remember that a CBDC concentrates power, opening the door to government control over our finances. It creates a system ripe for abuse. As *the Cato Institute* pointed out in a 2025 publication, CBDCs are not neutral technologies and come with inherent risks that disproportionately affect society’s most vulnerable.<br><br>You tout traceability as a benefit for preventing illicit activity, but that same traceability allows for unprecedented government surveillance of personal finances. This raises serious concerns about privacy violations. Remember: cash offers a vital layer of privacy that a CBDC inherently lacks. Regulations are insufficient to protect privacy. According to *a 2024 article on Central Bank Digital Currency Data Use and Privacy Protection*, even anonymized transactions can be reidentified with metadata. We've already seen governments expand surveillance powers in financial contexts. As noted in the *Washington University Law Review* in 1999, the U.S. government subtly encourages other countries to adopt measures that support surveillance, such as anti-money laundering measures.<br><br>Second, let's talk about the single point of failure. You argue about decentralized ledger technology, but this doesn't eliminate the core risk. While the opponent argues that decentralized ledger technology can prevent a single point of failure, this technology is still vulnerable. Concentrating all digital currency operations increases the potential impact of a successful cyberattack, disrupting the entire economy. A centralized CBDC creates a larger target. As *a 2024 article* points out, like any digital payment system, a CBDC is vulnerable to cybersecurity attacks, account and data breaches, and theft. The cybersecurity risks will require immense investment to combat new threats specific to digital currencies. The *International Monetary Fund* also notes in 2024 that cyber resilience is fundamental to the trust in CBDCs.<br><br>Third, we cannot ignore the cost. You dismiss the significant costs on taxpayers, but the infrastructure, security, and management of a CBDC require substantial public investment. These costs may not yield a corresponding increase in economic efficiency. Taxpayers would bear the financial burden.<br><br>Now, let's briefly address your judging criteria and definition. You frame this debate as solely about maximizing economic stability and growth. We disagree. Individual liberty and limited government are paramount. And your definition of a CBDC glosses over the inherent risks to financial freedom.<br><br>Finally, about those privacy concerns. You suggest privacy safeguards can mitigate surveillance risks. However, regulations can be changed or ignored, so relying on regulatory frameworks for privacy protection is insufficient. Also, your decentralized ledger technology argument doesn't solve the inherent centralization of control within the central bank. Moreover, *the World Bank* reports that mobile payments have slashed transaction costs for sending money across borders.<br><br>In conclusion, a US CBDC is a step towards government control and financial instability. We urge you to oppose it.<br><br>
