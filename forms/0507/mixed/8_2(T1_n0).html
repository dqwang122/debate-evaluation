                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    </ul>
                    <p>A signed consent form is required for participation.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>

Here's my feedback on the opening statement:<br><br>**Overall:** The opening statement is well-structured and presents a strong case for mandatory wage transparency. The arguments are logically sound and supported by the evidence provided by the Searcher. The definitions and judging criteria are also clearly stated. However, there are a few areas where the script can be improved:<br><br>**Specific Feedback:**<br><br>1.  **Citations:** Need to include in-text citations and a reference list.<br>2.  **Argument 1: Reducing the Gender Pay Gap:** While you mention the OECD, Forbes, World Bank, and a Canadian study, you need to be more specific with the data. For example, instead of just saying "pay transparency policies have been associated with a decrease in the gender wage gap," provide specific figures .<br>3.  **Argument 2: Promoting Economic Benefits:** You mention that a SHRM study indicates that "70% of organizations listing pay ranges on job postings experienced more applicants, and 66% saw an increase in applicant quality." Clarify who SHRM is  and add how that translates to economic benefits.<br>4.  **Argument 3: Addressing Discrimination:** While the argument is valid, it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how pay transparency helps combat discrimination. Perhaps include a statistic about the wage gap for women of color and how transparency can help close that gap.<br>5.  **Language:** The language is generally strong, but consider varying sentence structure and word choice to make it even more persuasive.<br><br>**Actionable Items:**<br><br>1.  Add in-text citations and a reference list.<br>2.  Provide specific data points and numbers in each argument to strengthen the claims.<br>3.  Clarify the connection between increased applicants/applicant quality  and the economic benefits for companies.<br>4.  Add more specific examples or data related to addressing discrimination, particularly for women of color.<br><br>I will now hand the document back to the Writer to implement these revisions.<br><br>

                                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to talk about fairness in the workplace, a principle at the heart of a just society. To ensure we're all on the same page, let's define "mandatory wage transparency laws." These are laws requiring employers to share salary ranges or pay data with their employees and the public. This applies to all businesses, big and small. Our goal is to actively shrink the gender wage gap, ensuring people get equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender. This also helps create fairer negotiations and shines a light on biases in the labor market.<br><br>Now, how should we decide if these laws are a good idea? We believe the fairest way to judge this is by whether they promote equal pay for equal work. That’s the heart of the issue.<br><br>Let's get into why we support mandatory wage transparency. First, wage transparency directly helps close the gender wage gap by revealing unfair pay differences. According to *Forbes*, women earn only 82 cents for every dollar earned by men. When salaries are open, women can see if they are being paid less than men for doing the exact same job. This is huge. It empowers them to negotiate for fair pay, armed with the facts. And if negotiation doesn't work, they can file complaints. All of this directly reduces pay inequality. In fact, *a 2024 study* suggests that being a woman in a state with a pay transparency law increases wages around 8.57%. This transparency isn't just a nice idea; it's a practical tool that empowers women to proactively address unfair pay.<br><br>Second, wage transparency reduces the need for individual salary negotiations, which can be biased. Think about it: when pay is secret, salary is often based on negotiation skills. However, *research shows* that pay negotiations are notoriously unfavorable to women. With transparent pay structures, salaries are based on objective criteria rather than biased negotiations. This reduces the impact of gender bias in pay decisions, leading to fairer outcomes for women. *A study* also found that male candidates who attempted negotiations were perceived to have greater chances of successful negotiations than their female counterparts.<br><br>Third, wage transparency benefits younger generations entering the workforce. *SHRM's February 2025 Current Events Pulse* revealed that nearly half  of HR professionals agree that their organization is transparent with employees about how pay decisions are made. This perceived transparency, according to SHRM, is crucial for younger workers who value openness and fairness in compensation, allowing them to negotiate effectively.<br><br>Implementing wage transparency is not just about fairness; it's about long-term economic health. Ignoring the gender pay gap is like ignoring a growing crack in a building's foundation. It may seem insignificant at first, but over time, it weakens the entire structure, leading to instability and collapse. Similarly, the long-term economic costs of the gender wage gap, such as reduced lifetime earnings for women, lower retirement savings, and decreased economic productivity, will far exceed the investment needed for early preventative measures like wage transparency. We urge you to support mandatory wage transparency laws and advocate for their implementation in your workplaces and communities. By working together, we can create a more equitable and fair society for all. Thank you.<br><br>
