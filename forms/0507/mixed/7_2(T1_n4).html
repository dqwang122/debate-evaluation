                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. We define dating expenses as costs incurred during courtship activities including but not limited to meals entertainment transportation and gifts. We further define shared equally as dividing the total dating expenses by the number of partners involved resulting in each partner contributing 50% of the total cost. Our judging criteria is promoting equitable and sustainable relationships. The side that best demonstrates how their approach to dating expenses foster's fairness reduces power imbalances and contributes to the long-term health and stability of relationships should win the debate. First equal sharing of expenses promotes gender equality and challenges traditional gender roles unequal division of dating expenses often reinforces outdated gender norms where men are expected to bear the financial burden. By sharing expenses equally we challenge these norms and promote a more egalitarian dynamic. Traditionally men were expected to pay for dates reinforcing the idea of the male as the provider. However a study by chapman university indicates that a majority of americans agree with statements measuring beliefs and gender equality one. As 126 year old stated i think if you expect equality in your relationship then there should be equality when paying for dates. Splitting the bill promotes gender equality by ensuring both people on the date have equal autonomy regardless of gender. Therefore by splitting expenses equally we actively dismantle traditional gender roles and foster a more equitable relationship dynamic. Second equal contribution fosters open communication and mutual respect. When both partners contribute equally it encourages open dialogue about finances and values? Leading to increase trust and understanding. This prevents resentment and power imbalances that can arise from one partner consistently paying more. Regularly discussing shared expenses helps foster open ongoing communication and provides a platform to address any issues or concerns before they become larger problems. Sharing finances can also create an environment of mutual respect and a stronger partnership. A recent study highlights that couples discuss finances around 5 months into the relationship even before saying i love you. Demonstrating the importance of financial transparency early on. Therefore equal contribution facilitates essential conversations. Builds trust and strengthens the foundation of the relationship. 3rd equal sharing creates financial stability and reduces financial stress. By splitting costs neither partner feels unduly burdened by the financial demands of dating. This reduces stress and allows both individuals to enjoy the dating experience without financial anxiety. Leading to more authentic connection. Studies show that couples who have similar spending habits savings goals and attitudes towards money are more likely to have a successful long-term relationship. Six. Sharing financial burdens can relieve pressure for both individuals within the relationship. Moreover when asked about their romantic lives overall respondents said their relationships had a net positive effect on their finances. 47.2% with only 11.5% reporting a net negative impact. Therefore sharing expenses not only promotes financial stability but also enhances the overall positive impact of the relationship. In conclusion we firmly believe that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. This approach promotes gender equality fosters open communication and creates financial stability all of which are crucial for building equitable and sustainable relationships.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We're here today to discuss whether dating expenses *should* be shared equally, and we firmly believe that mandating such a rigid approach is not only impractical but also potentially harmful. We will demonstrate why a strict 50/50 split is an oversimplification that ignores the complexities of real-life relationships. We will address the definition of "shared equally," the potential barriers to participation, the misconception that equal financial contributions guarantee relationship equality, and the clash with cultural norms.<br><br>First, let's address the definition of "shared equally." Our opponents likely define it as a strict 50/50 split. However, this definition is far too narrow. Relationships aren't always perfectly symmetrical, and insisting on a rigid 50/50 split simply doesn't reflect the realities of differing financial situations and diverse contributions within a partnership. Instead of a rigid 50/50 split, couples could agree on proportional contributions based on income, alternate who pays for dates, or prioritize non-financial contributions like household chores and emotional support.<br><br>Building on this, our second main point is that mandating equal payment ignores the potential for one partner to be a student or unemployed, creating a significant barrier to participation. Imagine a college student working part-time, trying to date someone with a full-time job. Insisting on a 50/50 split immediately puts the student at a disadvantage, potentially making dating inaccessible. It creates a barrier to participation based purely on financial status. As highlighted by *WorkRise Network in 2023*, unemployed individuals are *twice as likely* to experience psychological distress due to financial worries . Imposing such a financial burden on a student or unemployed partner is not only unfair but also potentially detrimental to their mental well-being.<br><br>Beyond financial considerations, our third point is that equal financial contributions don't guarantee relationship equality or mutual respect. You can split every bill down the middle and *still* have an unequal relationship. True equality encompasses emotional support, shared decision-making, and simply treating each other with kindness. Our opponents might equate equal financial contribution with 'fairness,' implying it solves all relationship imbalances. However, fairness is subjective and multifaceted. One partner might contribute more financially, while the other offers more emotional support, helps more with household tasks, or takes on more family responsibilities. As financial expert Tu argued in *a 2023 article*, insisting on a 50/50 split when income disparities exist can force the lower-earning partner to live beyond their means, breeding financial resentment . Forcing strict financial equality neglects these intangible contributions and can actually create resentment, undermining the very equality it seeks to achieve.<br><br>Furthermore, the concept of strict equal dating expense is not universally accepted and can clash with cultural norms. Different cultures have different expectations around dating and finances. As noted in *a scholarworks.gvsu.edu article*, cultural perspectives significantly influence expectations in relationships . Imposing a Westernized 50/50 expectation can clash with traditional practices and values, potentially causing friction and misunderstandings.<br><br>For all of these reasons, we believe that dating expenses should *not* be shared equally. Let's move beyond the simplistic 50/50 model and embrace a more nuanced, compassionate, and sustainable approach to dating expenses – one that prioritizes communication, fairness, and connection.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments contain four key flaws regarding our definition of "shared equally," barriers to participation, whether equal financial contributions guarantee relationship equality, and potential clashes with cultural norms.<br><br>First, the opposition misrepresents our stance on "shared equally" by portraying it as a rigid 50/50 split. While we advocate for equal contribution, we recognize that relationships aren't always symmetrical, and a strict interpretation *applied inflexibly* can be impractical . Our definition emphasizes the *intent* of equal sharing, achieved through flexible means, such as proportional contributions based on income or alternating who pays . It's about striving for balance over time and ensuring neither partner feels unduly burdened. We aim to foster a collaborative agreement recognizing unique financial circumstances, therefore, the idea of shared equally is not wrong, it is simply about promoting financial dynamics that suit each respective couple.<br><br>Second, the opposition argues that our approach creates a barrier to participation for students or unemployed individuals. While these situations *do* exist, it is important to contextualize this to avoid exaggerating the point. Many students have income, and short-term unemployment does not invalidate the long-term benefits of equitable financial practices within a relationship . Moreover, addressing potential financial imbalances early on fosters open communication and prevents resentment that could lead to relationship instability . Studies show that couples who discuss finances early on build a stronger foundation for their relationship . By preemptively discussing finances and coming to agreement, both sides reduce the stress associated with financial burden, and ultimately, create more sustainable equitable relationships.<br><br>Third, our opponents contend that equal financial contributions don't guarantee overall relationship equality, but this misses the point; we never claimed that splitting dating expenses is a *cure-all* for all relationship problems . Instead, it is an important step towards reducing *financial* stress and promoting mutual respect within the specific context of dating. Financial inequality can exacerbate existing power imbalances, whereas fair financial practices contribute to a more equitable dynamic in managing shared expenses . As relationships are viewed generally, finances have a net positive effect  . Therefore, this shows the importance of splitting and addressing finances.<br><br>Finally, the opposition suggests that our proposal clashes with cultural norms, but this argument risks using "cultural norms" to justify potentially unequal or exploitative practices. We acknowledge and respect cultural diversity, but we should also be open to challenging traditions that perpetuate financial imbalances if they cause one partner to be unduly burdened . Many cultures are evolving toward more egalitarian norms, and it’s crucial to promote fairness while remaining sensitive to cultural values . By taking this approach, we still allow individual interpretation of culture, without enabling bad financial habits.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, everyone, let's get this straight. Those who endorse equal dating expenses will find that to be a false economy when they are confronted with the issue that finances is the minor concern when it comes to relationships. We're here to show why that's a bad idea. We'll hit their main points hard and prove that our approach is far more realistic and fair.<br><br>First, let's talk about their definitions. They define "dating expenses" as just meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts. This is way too limited. What about the time spent planning dates, the emotional support offered, or even contributions to household chores that free up time for dates? It’s like saying a car is only worth the cost of its parts, ignoring the labor and design that went into building it. And their claim that "shared equally" means a strict 50/50 split completely ignores real-life financial differences.<br><br>Second, they claim that equal contribution fosters equitable and sustainable relationships and promotes gender equality. This sounds great, but their solution misses the mark. Mandating equal expenses doesn't magically create equality. True gender equality isn't about splitting the bill down the middle; it's about respect, opportunity, and shared decision-making. Focusing solely on finances is like saying solving a math problem is the same as understanding the whole equation. It's a superficial fix that doesn't address the deeper issues.<br><br>Third, they argue that equal contribution fosters open communication, but this is simply not true. Pressuring someone to pay equally when they can't afford it shuts down communication; it doesn't open it up. Mutual respect involves understanding each other's situations, not forcing a rigid financial model. According to *BetterHelp in 2025*, financial stress can erode intimacy and cause blame and resentment in relationships. Forcing a 50/50 split will only cause financial stress, not reduce it.<br><br>Now, let's reinforce our key arguments. We’ve shown that relationships are complex, and a 50/50 split oversimplifies things. Imagine a student trying to keep up with someone who's fully employed. According to *BestColleges in 2025*, the average student loan debt is $38,375. Asking a student with that kind of financial burden to split every expense equally is just not fair. Plus, forcing this model ignores cultural norms. As the *Brainz Magazine* reported in 2024, social norms and behaviors vary widely across cultures. What is considered appropriate in one culture might be perceived very differently in another. You can’t just impose a Western standard on everyone. As highlighted in *Klinenberg & Ansari's 2015 book Modern Romance*, different cultures have different dating norms, and in some Asian cultures, family input and approval matter a lot for dating and marriage.<br><br>Finally, they tried to soften their stance by suggesting "flexible" equal sharing, but this is still flawed. It still operates under the premise of eventual equal financial input, which just doesn't work for everyone. Instead of a rigid formula, we advocate for open communication, mutual understanding, and a flexible approach that considers individual financial circumstances, cultural norms, and non-financial contributions to the relationship. As highlighted in *a report in 2024*, financial inequality is a natural occurrence in many relationships, and equality is about balance, respect, and shared decision-making, not necessarily splitting every cost 50/50.<br><br>Ultimately, relationships should be built on understanding, respect, and communication, not a rigid financial formula.<br><br></div>

In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the definition of shared equally. And the role of financial equity in relationships. The core of the opposition's argument rests on misrepresenting our definition of shared equally and dating expenses. They create a straw man. Claiming we advocate for a rigid inflexible 50/50 split. This is false. We champion the intent of equal sharing achieved through flexible means that suit each unique relationship. We broaden the definition of dating expenses acknowledging contributions like time and effort contribute indirectly to finances. We and the negative both feel finances are important. So the negatives claims are all the more reason to promote the affirmative position. Are opponents argue that equal financial contributions don't create relationship equality. But they missed the point. We never claimed it was a cure-all. Instead it's a step towards reducing financial stress and promoting mutual respect. Financial inequality can exacerbate existing power imbalances. Where is fair financial practices contribute to a more equitable dynamic? As relationships are viewed generally. Finances have a net positive effect. Regarding practicality we recognize concerns about students unemployed individuals and cultural norms offering solutions like adjusted expectations and temporary suspensions. We advocate for open communication understanding and a flexible approach considering individual circumstances and cultural norms. This isn't about imposing western values but about promoting fairness within each relationship and culture. Ultimately this debate boils down to fairness. Outdated gender roles and financial imbalances perpetuate inequality. And we must strive for equitable practices we want to empower individuals and foster relationships built on sustainability.<br><br>

The core disagreement lies in defining "shared equally," which the opposition fundamentally misunderstands.<br><br>They misrepresent our stance as a rigid 50/50 split. Our rebuttal is that we advocate for the *intent* of equal sharing, recognizing diverse financial realities. Therefore, the opposition's core premise is defeated. Couples can adapt how they share expenses through proportional contributions or alternating payments.<br><br>Our approach fosters open communication and mutual respect. As highlighted in *a 2023 study in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* by Serido and de Oliveira, almost every participant recalled a recent financial disagreement with their partner when prompted . This underscores the importance of addressing financial dynamics proactively. We are promoting equality, and data supports the positive impact of financial agreements on relationships.<br><br>The opposition suggests our model clashes with cultural norms. However, using culture to justify unequal practices is unacceptable. Fairness and sensitivity can coexist and evolve.<br><br>In closing, our approach is forward-thinking and adaptable. We aren’t mandating a rigid formula. As *ABC News reported in 2023*, financial advisor Kate McCallum prefers focusing on fairness over strict equity, creating a more holistic approach to relationship finances . We best meet the judging criteria: promoting fairness, reducing power imbalances, and contributing to lasting love. Choose equity. Choose sustainability. Support our motion.
