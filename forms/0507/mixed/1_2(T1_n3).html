                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling, a legislative limit on the amount of national debt the U.S. Treasury can incur. We define "abolish" as formally putting an end to the system, practice, or institution of the debt ceiling.<br><br>Our judging criteria is the promotion of economic stability and efficient governance. We contend that the debt ceiling, while intended to promote fiscal responsibility, has repeatedly created economic instability and political gridlock. Abolishing it will lead to a more stable economic environment where the government can reliably meet its obligations and focus on long-term economic growth.<br><br>First, the debt ceiling creates unnecessary economic instability and uncertainty. The debt ceiling has repeatedly led to political standoffs and threats of default, which negatively impact financial markets and the overall economy. For instance, the 2011 debt ceiling crisis led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, resulting in increased borrowing costs for the government and businesses . A report by the Government Accountability Office  found that the 2011 debt ceiling impasse resulted in billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs . Eliminating the debt ceiling would remove this recurring source of instability and prevent future economic damage. According to a CNN article in June 2023, reforms that make future standoffs less risky would be a "positive" from a credit ratings perspective . By removing the debt ceiling, we are actively securing the U.S. credit rating and avoiding needless economic damage.<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling does not effectively control government spending. The debt ceiling is a poor tool for fiscal discipline, as it only addresses the *result* of spending decisions, not the decisions themselves. Congress still has the power to set the budget, and the debt ceiling simply creates a potential crisis when the government needs to pay its bills. The debt ceiling has not achieved its stated goal of imposing fiscal discipline on Congress. The statutory debt ceiling is a completely arbitrary value, there has never been any economic justification for any of its historical values . A New York Times article argues that the debt ceiling has not served a useful purpose in living memory . Congress can implement other fiscal restraints that provide more direct oversight and impact on fiscal policy.<br><br>Third, abolishing the debt ceiling would streamline government operations and reduce political gridlock. The debt ceiling process consumes significant time and resources, diverting attention from more pressing economic issues. It also provides opportunities for political posturing and gridlock, hindering the government's ability to address important challenges. Louise Sheiner, in her testimony to the House Budget Committee, argued that the debt ceiling distracts from real, tangible economic challenges . Freeing Congress from these manufactured crises would allow them to focus on actual economic policies that bolster the economy.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling causes unnecessary economic instability, fails to control government spending, and fosters political gridlock. Abolishing the debt ceiling will promote economic stability, improve government efficiency, and allow policymakers to focus on addressing real economic challenges. For these reasons, we strongly affirm the resolution: Congress should abolish the debt ceiling.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the resolution that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling. While our opponents may argue that this promotes economic stability, we contend it will foster fiscal irresponsibility and long-term economic harm. Let's delve into why maintaining the debt ceiling is crucial for fiscal responsibility.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial check on government spending, potentially leading to uncontrolled debt accumulation. Our opponents might suggest that budget resolutions and spending caps are effective substitutes, but we disagree. The debt ceiling compels Congress to periodically review and authorize further borrowing, providing a vital opportunity to scrutinize spending levels. Removing it eradicates this built-in accountability measure. According to *the Baker Institute*, these measures have proven ineffective, stating that "neither the BCA nor the debt ceiling limit Congress’s ability or will to spend money that is financed with debt." Without the debt ceiling, Congress has a green light to spend without constraint, burdening future generations with unsustainable debt.<br><br>Second, eliminating the debt ceiling *will* erode investor confidence in U.S. debt, potentially increasing borrowing costs. Our opponents might say that the debt ceiling is an outdated mechanism, but we believe it *is* a vital signal of fiscal discipline. As *the World Economic Forum* points out, only a handful of countries employ a debt ceiling to "signal fiscal discipline to their lenders and investors." Removing this signal could be interpreted as a lack of commitment to managing debt responsibly, prompting investors to demand higher returns for lending to the U.S. government. This isn't just about abstract economic theory; higher borrowing costs translate directly into higher interest rates for average Americans – on mortgages, car loans, and credit cards.<br><br>Third, the debt ceiling, despite its flaws, forces Congress to prioritize essential government services over discretionary spending. While our opponents may claim that the debt ceiling leads to political gridlock, we maintain that it is a necessary tool for fiscal prioritization. The need to raise the debt ceiling compels lawmakers to consider which government programs are most critical and ensure they are adequately funded before allocating funds to less essential areas. In 2011, *Republicans in Congress used the debt ceiling as leverage for deficit reduction* because of the lack of Congressional normal order for fiscal year budget votes. While this can lead to political brinkmanship, it also provides a crucial opportunity to reassess spending priorities and ensure that taxpayer dollars are being used effectively.<br><br>Now, let's address the opposition's claims directly. They argue that the debt ceiling creates unnecessary economic instability. While it's true that debt ceiling debates can lead to political standoffs, as evidenced by *the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, where the S&P 500 index fell by approximately 17%*, removing it doesn't guarantee smoother fiscal management. It eliminates a critical check on spending, potentially leading to increased debt and economic instability. Political brinkmanship is not solely a result of the debt ceiling; it's inherent in the budgetary process, and removing the debt ceiling won't eliminate it.<br><br>They also argue that the debt ceiling does not effectively control government spending. But, while the debt ceiling may not always be effective, its existence introduces uncertainty that compels negotiation and compromise on spending. The budget process alone is insufficient to control debt because it lacks the immediate and direct pressure of the debt ceiling.<br><br>For these reasons, we strongly oppose the resolution. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition's arguments rest on a flawed premise: that the debt ceiling is a necessary tool for fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that it undermines fiscal responsibility and introduces more problems than it solves. We will address their claims about fiscal responsibility, investor confidence, and prioritization of government services.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that abolishing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial check on government spending, fostering fiscal irresponsibility. However, economic stability is actually a prerequisite for responsible fiscal policy. The debt ceiling undermines this stability, making responsible fiscal planning even more challenging. The Government Accountability Office found that the 2011 debt ceiling crisis resulted in billions of dollars in increased borrowing costs . It’s hard to be fiscally responsible when the debt ceiling needlessly makes things more expensive. Michael Ettlinger from the Economic Policy Institute notes that the debt ceiling is arbitrary and lacks economic justification . The opposition is essentially saying we need the debt ceiling to force fiscal discipline, but as we've shown, the debt ceiling itself makes us less fiscally sound.<br><br>Second, they claim that eliminating the debt ceiling will erode investor confidence in U.S. debt. But the debt ceiling itself is a recurring source of instability that harms investor confidence. The 2011 debt ceiling crisis, which led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor's, shows that the debt ceiling actually undermines investor confidence . It also causes massive market uncertainty. Francis, an executive at Fitch Ratings, stated that reforms making future standoffs less risky would be a "positive" from a credit ratings perspective . Therefore, abolishing the debt ceiling would increase, not decrease, investor confidence by removing the risk of manufactured crises.<br><br>Third, our opponents argue that the debt ceiling forces Congress to prioritize essential government services. Congress must make spending choices during the budget process with or without the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling only distracts from real economic challenges. As Louise Sheiner testified to the House Budget Committee, the debt ceiling distracts from tangible economic challenges . It does not help to address them. While the negative might claim we want to spend recklessly, this is a strawman. Abolishing the debt ceiling will not eliminate prioritization. It will just mean that we prioritize in a more effective and rational way.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling fails to promote fiscal responsibility, harms investor confidence, and hinders effective prioritization of government services. Abolishing it will promote economic stability, improve government efficiency, and allow policymakers to focus on addressing real economic challenges. For these reasons, we maintain our strong support for the resolution.<br><br></div>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition attempts to paint a rosy picture of a world without the debt ceiling, but their arguments are based on short-sightedness and a misunderstanding of fiscal responsibility. We will demonstrate that the debt ceiling, while imperfect, is a crucial tool for maintaining economic stability in the long run. We will address their claims about fiscal responsibility, investor confidence, and prioritization of government services.<br><br>First, the opposition claims the debt ceiling undermines fiscal responsibility and makes things more expensive, citing increased borrowing costs during the 2011 crisis. However, they commit a logical fallacy by focusing solely on the short-term instability caused by debt ceiling debates while ignoring the potential for long-term fiscal irresponsibility. While these debates may cause temporary market jitters, *true* fiscal responsibility requires tools to prevent excessive government spending . As Veronique de Rugy notes in *National Review*, eliminating the debt ceiling removes a major check on government, and "the bottom line is that the federal budget is a horrible mess, and Congress is to blame for it" . We acknowledge the instability caused by the debt ceiling, but the alternative—uncontrolled spending—is equally, if not *more*, unstable in the long run, burdening future generations with unsustainable debt.<br><br>Second, they argue the debt ceiling harms investor confidence, pointing to the 2011 downgrade. But the debt ceiling is a *necessary evil*. While it can lead to short-term market fluctuations, it ultimately signals to investors that the U.S. government is committed to fiscal discipline, even if that commitment is sometimes tested. As the *World Economic Forum* points out, only a handful of countries employ a debt ceiling to "signal fiscal discipline to their lenders and investors," demonstrating its value as a credible commitment . Eliminating this signal could be interpreted as a lack of commitment to managing debt responsibly, undermining long-term investor confidence and potentially leading to higher borrowing costs. Therefore, while there are short-term risks, there are significant long-term benefits to investor confidence with the debt ceiling present.<br><br>Third, our opponents argue that the debt ceiling distracts from real economic challenges, but the debt ceiling *forces* Congress to confront these challenges head-on. Rather than distracting, it creates a moment of reckoning where lawmakers must seriously consider the nation's financial health and make difficult decisions. The claim that abolishing the debt ceiling will automatically lead to more effective and rational prioritization is a fallacy. Without the pressure of the debt ceiling, Congress is likely to continue its pattern of unchecked spending, jeopardizing the nation's economic future. Getting rid of the debt ceiling would eliminate a major check on the government . A breach of the debt limit would mean stopping payments to programs like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, veterans' benefits, child nutrition programs, and others . As such, it is critical to prioritize and consider the essential needs of our citizens.<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling fosters fiscal prioritization and is a necessary evil that promotes fiscal discipline and ultimately increases investor confidence. Abolishing it carries significant risks, including economic recession, financial market disruptions, and increased borrowing costs . We stand firm in our opposition to abolishing the debt ceiling.<br><br>

But their arguments disregard a fundamental principle. Fiscal responsibility is paramount. While they claim the debt ceiling is problematic. We maintain its a vital mechanism for ensuring a stable economic future. It's not about lacking knowledge. It's about choosing to ignore the importance of this fiscal safeguard. First let's reinforce why the debt ceiling is crucial for fiscal responsibility. As we've stated it forces congress to periodically review borrowing and spending habits. Eliminating it removes a key accountability measure. The opposition suggests that budget resolutions are sufficient but these are often ineffective. Without the debt ceiling congress can spend without constraint. Potentially burdening future generations with debt. The debt ceiling also signals fiscal discipline to investors removing it could erode investor confidence and potentially increase borrowing costs. Leading to higher interest rates. It compels lawmakers to prioritize programs ensuring taxpayer dollars are used effectively. It's a mechanism that makes our elected officials think twice before committing to spending. That we as taxpayers will ultimately have to cover. Let's consider whether removing the debt ceiling guarantees smoother fiscal management. It's simply removes a check on spending. While the opposition focuses on temporary disruptions caused by debt ceiling debates these are manageable. The potential for fiscal mismanagement without the debt ceiling is far more concerning. It's a guardrail preventing drastic debt increases. As we have discussed. The debt ceiling raise forces accountability and makes lawmakers face the consequences of their spending decisions. It's not a perfect system but it's a necessary one to prevent unchecked spending. Third the debt ceiling introduces uncertainty that compels negotiation and compromise. The threat of hitting the ceiling forces both parties to negotiate. Potentially leading to spending cuts or fiscal reforms that might not otherwise occur. Removing the debt ceiling eliminates this pressure point. Making it easier to increase spending without considering the long-term consequences the opposition implies congress will simply cut spending responsibly. Through the normal budget process. However according to a report titled reforming the appropriations process. Those who desire to constrain spending do not enjoy the leverage generally conferred on coalitions built to protect the status quo. Therefore as highlighted in the report the appropriations process is truly stacked against fiscal hawks. The debt ceiling while sometimes disruptive. Creates leverage for those advocating fiscal restraint. Finally regarding the claim that the debt ceiling undermines economic stability. It's true that debt ceiling debates can cause uncertainty. However that uncertainty is a symptom of political polarization. Not a reason to eliminate a key fiscal tool. Markets have historically priced in these debates. Removing the debt ceiling eliminates a crucial leverage point. For fiscal conservatives. To negotiate spending cuts and control government expansion. In fact as mentioned in a report titled the debt ceiling will be reinstated on january 1. Two of the three major credit rating agencies standard & poor's and fitch have downgraded the nation's credit rating. And i've cited brinkmanship over the debt ce. As one of the major factors. Along with a concern about the size of the mounting debt. Furthermore according to the british journal of political science. Political support for brinkmanship in this context is partially a product of voter ignorance. The debt ceiling is a tool that can be used to force negotiation and bring attention to the consequences of unchecked spending. It's not about creating chaos it's about forcing accountability.<br><br>
