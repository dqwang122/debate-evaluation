                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss the crucial role labor unions play in driving economic growth. To highlight the importance of this discussion, union households hold significantly more median wealth compared to nonunion households, demonstrating the tangible economic benefits unions provide.<br><br>To ensure we're all on the same page, let's define our terms. By "labor unions," we mean organizations that represent workers, advocating for better wages, improved working conditions, and overall well-being through collective bargaining. "Economic growth" refers to improvements in indicators like GDP, productivity, and, importantly, income equality, benefiting individuals across all demographics in today's global economy.<br><br>So, how should we determine the winner of this debate? We propose that the most equitable approach is to assess which side can demonstrate the most substantial and widespread positive impact on overall economic well-being. This includes considering specific metrics such as increases in GDP per capita, reductions in the Gini coefficient—a measure of income inequality—and the expansion of union-led apprenticeship programs.<br><br>With this framework established, let's delve into our core arguments. First, labor unions drive up wages, which in turn fuels consumer spending and stimulates economic growth. When workers have more disposable income, they are empowered to purchase more goods and services, thereby increasing demand and boosting production, ultimately creating jobs and fostering economic expansion. Unions establish a pay standard that nonunion employers follow. *The Economic Policy Institute* supports this, noting that a high school graduate in an industry that is 25% unionized earns 5% more than similar workers in less unionized industries . This effect is particularly pronounced for low- and middle-income workers, who are more likely to inject any additional earnings directly back into the economy.<br><br>Second, collective bargaining through unions reduces income inequality, leading to a stronger and more resilient middle class. Unions ensure that workers receive a fairer share of the profits they contribute to creating. Research in the *Quarterly Journal of Economics* reveals that the rise of unions from 1936 to 1968 explains about 25% of the decline in the Gini coefficient, a key measure of income inequality. This narrowing of the gap between the rich and the poor fosters a more balanced and sustainable economy. A robust middle class serves as the backbone of a healthy economy, driving both consumption and investment. *The Journalist's Resource* also supports this point, noting the historical impact of unions on reducing inequality .<br><br>Third, union apprenticeships cultivate skilled tradespeople, filling essential roles in the economy and bolstering infrastructure development. Union-sponsored apprenticeship programs offer comprehensive training in vital skilled trades such as carpentry, plumbing, and electrical work. A *2021 research study by Dr. Larissa Petrucci* at the University of Oregon found that union apprenticeship programs lead in diversity and show higher success rates compared to non-union programs, especially for women and people of color. These programs address the increasing demand for skilled workers, supporting critical infrastructure projects and overall economic growth.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions are not merely beneficial for workers; they are beneficial for the entire economy. They elevate wages, diminish inequality, and cultivate a skilled workforce. By supporting labor unions, we can build a more prosperous and equitable economy for all. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that labor unions are detrimental to economic growth, which we define as a sustained increase in a nation's real gross domestic product  over time, reflecting increased productivity and overall prosperity.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing economic efficiency, prioritizing policies that promote optimal resource allocation, increased productivity, innovation, and competitiveness. We contend that labor unions, through artificial wage inflation and restrictive practices, undermine this efficiency, hindering overall economic growth.<br><br>First, labor unions reduce competitiveness and productivity by artificially inflating wages and imposing restrictive work rules. These practices increase business costs and reduce productivity, making businesses less competitive in both domestic and international markets. A study highlighted by the Reddit community on Austrian Economics  points out that labor unions hinder economic growth by reducing profits and competitiveness. Higher labor costs directly impact a company's ability to invest in innovation, expand operations, and create jobs. By artificially increasing costs, unions create inefficiencies that diminish overall economic output, hindering growth.<br><br>Second, labor union wage demands can fuel inflation, destabilizing the economy and hindering long-term growth. When unions successfully negotiate wage increases that exceed productivity gains, businesses often pass these increased costs onto consumers in the form of higher prices, leading to inflation. Wage increases without corresponding productivity gains result in a decrease in the value of currency and overall economic instability. As noted by sources discussing labor law and economic development , increased labor costs impact business. This can lead to a dangerous cycle where higher wages lead to higher prices, which in turn lead to demands for even higher wages, ultimately eroding purchasing power, reducing investment, and destabilizing the economy.<br><br>Third, labor unions inhibit labor market flexibility and innovation by resisting changes to work rules and practices, even when those changes are necessary to improve efficiency or adapt to new technologies. This inflexibility stifles innovation and prevents businesses from responding quickly to changing market conditions, thereby hindering economic growth. As the Searcher found, unions can lead to higher wages and benefits, which may reduce productivity due to increased costs for employers . By resisting necessary reforms and protecting outdated work practices, unions impede the adoption of new technologies and more efficient production methods, ultimately hindering economic growth and preventing the economy from reaching its full potential.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions, while potentially providing benefits to their members, are detrimental to overall economic growth due to their negative impact on competitiveness, their potential to fuel inflation, and their inhibition of labor market flexibility and innovation. We urge you to side with policies that foster a dynamic and competitive economy, free from the artificial constraints imposed by labor unions.<br><br></div>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, concerning their definitions, criteria, and arguments regarding productivity, inflation, and innovation.<br><br>First, regarding the definition of economic growth, they narrowly define it as simply an increase in GDP, ignoring the crucial element of equitable distribution. We believe they set up a false dichotomy by saying that economic growth and equity are mutually exclusive. The data indicates otherwise . Economic growth cannot be truly sustainable or beneficial if it only benefits a small fraction of the population. We maintain that a more holistic view of economic growth includes improvements in income equality, benefiting all demographics, just like the US Treasury suggests . Ignoring income inequality can lead to social unrest and instability, ultimately undermining long-term economic growth.<br><br>Second, concerning the judging criteria, the opposition prioritizes maximizing economic efficiency while potentially sacrificing equity. We contend that prioritizing efficiency without considering equity is shortsighted. We should remind the judges that a truly efficient economy will benefit the most people . The endogenous growth theory supports this . Equity and widespread benefit *include* the negative's concerns for efficiency. Prioritizing widespread benefits ensures a more stable and resilient economy in the long run.<br><br>Third, they argue that labor unions reduce competitiveness and productivity. This claim is supported by a Reddit post , which hardly constitutes credible evidence. In contrast, numerous academic studies indicate that unions can positively impact productivity, particularly in manufacturing . Furthermore, are wages high because of unions, or are unions formed in industries where high productivity and profitability *already* allow for higher wages? *The Fraser Institute* supports this . Unions might be a symptom of a healthy, productive industry, not the cause of reduced productivity.<br><br>Fourth, the claim that union wage demands fuel inflation is a hasty generalization. Wage increases don't automatically lead to inflation . The *Center for American Progress* supports this . The opponent's source is questionable . In recent decades, wages have not kept pace with productivity, meaning there is room for wage increases without necessarily causing inflation. Moreover, executive compensation and corporate profits have grown far faster than worker wages, representing a more significant driver of inequality and potential inflation.<br><br>Fifth, the assertion that unions inhibit labor market flexibility and innovation is a straw man argument. They portray unions as categorically against any change, which is an oversimplification. Unions *can* promote innovation by giving workers a voice and encouraging them to share ideas . Labor unions can both boost and hinder innovation; too much protection may stifle innovation, while moderate protection can enhance it . By improving the terms and conditions of employment, collective bargaining can increase worker productivity and innovation.<br><br>In conclusion, the opposition's arguments are based on narrow definitions, questionable evidence, and logical fallacies. We maintain that labor unions are beneficial for economic growth by promoting equity, increasing productivity, and fostering innovation.<br><br>

Our position remains firm: labor unions are indispensable for fostering broad-based economic growth. Let's now address the points raised by the opposition.<br><br>First, they contend that labor unions diminish competitiveness and productivity by artificially inflating wages. However, this argument misrepresents our stance, committing a straw man fallacy. We've never claimed that all unions are flawless or that wage increases should be limitless. Instead, unions serve as a crucial counterbalance to corporate power, ensuring workers receive a fair share of the profits they contribute to creating. Unions advocate for policies that benefit workers, such as minimum wage laws and workplace safety regulations. Higher wages translate to increased consumer spending, which in turn stimulates economic growth. Furthermore, unions often enhance working conditions and provide standardized training, thereby boosting productivity. According to *Union-Built Matters*, union-led apprenticeship programs offer comprehensive training that combines hands-on work with classroom education, ensuring crucial skills are passed down to a new generation. The argument that unions render domestic industries less competitive globally overlooks the offsetting advantages of heightened productivity and innovation that unions frequently encourage.<br><br>Second, they assert that labor union wage demands fuel inflation. This is an oversimplified view of a complex issue. Wage increases do not automatically trigger inflation. Businesses can absorb some of the increased costs through enhanced productivity or by accepting slightly reduced profit margins. The opposition's inflation argument disregards the fact that non-union sectors of the economy are also susceptible to inflationary pressures. We are not operating in a vacuum where only union wages matter. Moreover, a stronger middle class with greater disposable income drives economic growth. In fact, research from the *U.S. Department of the Treasury* indicates that nonunionized firms in competition with unionized workplaces may choose to raise wages, change hiring practices, or improve their workplace environment to attract workers. This demonstrates that the positive effects of unions extend beyond their members.<br><br>Third, they assert that labor unions are detrimental to economic growth overall. This ignores the numerous ways unions contribute to a healthier economy. Their claim that unions stifle innovation is not supported by empirical evidence. The comparison of different economies is flawed because it does not account for policy interventions. Unions advocate for better working conditions, which lead to happier, more productive workers. According to *WorkRise Network*, unions may also reduce turnover by increasing job satisfaction. They provide valuable training and apprenticeship programs, ensuring we have a skilled workforce ready to tackle the challenges of a modern economy. As *Measuring diversity in construction apprenticeship programs* indicates, women, Hispanic workers, and workers of color have higher participation and completion rates in union-based registered apprenticeship programs compared with nonunion programs. Unions also reduce income inequality, leading to a stronger middle class and more stable economic growth. As seen in research, unions are able to win better wages and benefits for working people, reducing income inequality as a result.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions are not a barrier to economic growth. They are a vital component of a fair and prosperous economy for all. Thank you.<br><br>
