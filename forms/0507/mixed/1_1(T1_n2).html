                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                </summary>
                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss a critical issue impacting the financial stability of the United States: the debt ceiling. To ensure clarity, when we say "Congress should abolish the debt ceiling," we mean the complete elimination of the statutory limit on the total amount of money the federal government can borrow to meet its *existing* legal obligations. This allows the Treasury to pay for what Congress has *already* approved, regardless of current economic conditions or political climates.<br><br>Our position is that the most important judging criterion today should be which side provides the most beneficial outcome for the U.S. economy. We firmly believe that abolishing the debt ceiling is the clear path to that beneficial outcome.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling significantly reduces the risk of a U.S. default and avoids potentially catastrophic economic consequences. The debt ceiling creates a situation where the U.S. could fail to pay its bills, not because it lacks the resources, but because of political gridlock. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned in *a letter to Congress in 2023* that a default could "cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihoods of all Americans, and global financial stability" . *Foreign Policy reported in 2023* that economists predict a default could cause U.S. stock prices to fall by one-fifth and significantly contract the economy . It's a risk we simply cannot afford to take. Removing the debt ceiling is a responsible step toward preventing such a disaster. Furthermore, the political brinkmanship surrounding the debt ceiling has real costs. Instead of citing *Wikipedia*, let's consider that the debt ceiling crisis of 2011 raised borrowing costs for the government.<br><br>Second, abolishing the debt ceiling aligns congressional actions with previously approved spending, streamlining governmental processes. The current system forces Congress to vote twice on spending decisions. First, they authorize the spending. Then, they have to vote again to raise the debt ceiling to pay for it. This is redundant and creates unnecessary political drama. As House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth pointed out in *an interview with the House Budget Committee in February 2021*, the debt ceiling "certainly hasn’t constrained the debt in any way. All it’s done is open up opportunities for mischief and brinksmanship" . Removing the debt ceiling streamlines the process, ensuring that the government can fulfill its financial obligations without these artificial constraints. Some argue that the debt ceiling acts as a check on government spending. However, Congress retains full control over the budget through the appropriations process. The debt ceiling simply forces them to authorize payment for spending they have already approved.<br><br>Third, removing the debt ceiling reinforces the full faith and credit of the United States. The debt ceiling undermines our reputation as a reliable borrower. As *the World Economic Forum reported in 2024*, failure to pay bondholders would prompt credit rating agencies to downgrade Treasury debt, leading to higher borrowing costs for the government, businesses, and households . Abolishing the debt ceiling sends a clear signal that the U.S. is committed to meeting its obligations, strengthening our financial standing on the world stage.<br><br>In conclusion, abolishing the debt ceiling is a necessary step to protect our economy, streamline government operations, and maintain our credibility. Contact your representatives and urge them to support the abolishment of the debt ceiling, securing America's financial future. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should not abolish the debt ceiling. The debt ceiling is a legislative limit on the amount of national debt that the U.S. Treasury can incur, limiting the amount of money the federal government can borrow to pay its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, military salaries, national debt interest, tax refunds, and other payments. This definition is important because it clarifies that the debt ceiling doesn't authorize new spending, but rather allows the government to pay for existing obligations already approved by Congress.<br><br>Our judging criteria is fiscal stability and responsible governance. The most desirable outcome is one that promotes long-term fiscal stability and responsible governance, ensuring the U.S. government meets its obligations without jeopardizing the economic well-being of its citizens or the global economy. We should evaluate whether abolishing the debt ceiling contributes to or detracts from this stability and responsibility.<br><br>First, the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility by requiring legislative consent, giving Congress oversight authority . The Council on Foreign Relations notes that the debt limit requires legislative consent, providing Congress some oversight authority and engendering fiscal accountability . Without the debt ceiling, there would be less incentive for Congress to control spending, potentially leading to a rapid accumulation of debt. Economist De Rugy argues that the debt ceiling helps keep the budget normalized, stating that "Congress has behaved irresponsibly for years" . Abolishing the debt ceiling would remove a critical check on government spending, fostering an environment of fiscal irresponsibility and potentially increasing the national debt.<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling encourages negotiation and compromise on fiscal policy, leading to more considered decisions. While often contentious, the debt ceiling forces dialogue and potential agreements on spending and revenue. Removing this pressure could result in unilateral actions and less fiscal restraint. Scott Peters  and Bill Huizenga  reintroduced the Responsible Budgeting Act , which would create new mechanisms to raise the debt ceiling while promoting fiscally responsible solutions . This act demonstrates that the debt ceiling can be a catalyst for bipartisan efforts to address fiscal challenges. Thus, maintaining the debt ceiling is crucial for fostering a balanced and responsible approach to fiscal policy.<br><br>Third, abolishing the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. debt and trigger economic instability. Removing this fiscal restraint could signal to investors that the U.S. is not committed to fiscal discipline, potentially leading to higher borrowing costs and a financial crisis. As the Brookings Institution points out, eliminating the debt ceiling could lead to higher borrowing costs and an increased risk of economic recession . The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget warns that removing the debt ceiling could lead to default, higher interest rates, and a severe economic downturn, risking global financial instability and significant job losses . Thus, the debt ceiling provides a necessary safeguard against economic instability and maintains investor confidence.<br><br>In conclusion, maintaining the debt ceiling is essential for fiscal responsibility, encouraging negotiation, and preserving economic stability. Abolishing it would remove a crucial check on government spending, undermine investor confidence, and potentially trigger a financial crisis. For these reasons, we stand firmly against abolishing the debt ceiling.<br><br></div>

Let's address why this artificial constraint should be removed.<br><br>First, let's directly address the claim that the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility. While the debt ceiling is *intended* to promote fiscal responsibility, in practice, it has repeatedly been used as a political tool, causing economic instability. According to *Dr. Laura Blessing, a Senior Fellow at The Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University*, "There is little evidence that the debt ceiling provides fiscal restraint." She further explained that debt limit crises have not led to meaningful reforms and have sometimes made the budgeting process less functional. True fiscal responsibility stems from responsible budgeting and spending decisions, which Congress already controls through the appropriations process, as *Bloomberg Government* explains. These crucial budgetary processes are undermined by debt ceiling brinkmanship. Therefore, keeping the debt ceiling risks another crisis, while abolishing it safeguards our economy.<br><br>Second, let's consider the argument that the debt ceiling encourages negotiation and compromise. While the debt ceiling *can* lead to negotiations, it does so by creating artificial crises that threaten the economy. This is not a constructive way to foster compromise. Genuine negotiation should occur during the budget process, not under the threat of default. As we have discussed, House Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth pointed out that the debt ceiling hasn't stopped debt and just causes problems. Therefore, abolishing the debt ceiling streamlines government operations.<br><br>Third, our opponents suggest that abolishing the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. debt. On the contrary, *maintaining* the debt ceiling undermines confidence in U.S. debt by creating the risk of default. Abolishing it signals that the U.S. is committed to meeting its obligations, which *strengthens* investor confidence. In fact, *two of the three major credit rating agencies – Standard and Poor’s and Fitch* – have downgraded the United States’ credit rating and directly cited political gridlock surrounding the debt ceiling as one of the reasons why, according to *the American Action Forum, a center-right policy institute*. As the *World Economic Forum* has noted, failing to pay bondholders would cause our credit rating to go down and borrowing costs to rise. Therefore, abolishing the debt ceiling reinforces U.S. credibility, which strengthens our financial standing.<br><br>Also, remember what's most important here: what's best for the U.S. economy. According to *a 2023 report from Moody’s Analytics, a leading economic research firm*, even a short-term breach of the federal debt limit could reduce gross domestic product, result in the loss of 2 million jobs, and wipe out trillions of dollars in U.S. household wealth. We think abolishing the debt ceiling leads to a better outcome. It avoids crises, streamlines government operations, and strengthens our reputation. That's why we think it's the right choice.<br><br>Finally, abolishing the debt ceiling is about removing a limit on borrowing to pay for things Congress already approved. It allows the Treasury to pay our bills, no matter the economic situation. As the *Senate* reports, since 1978, the debt limit has been raised or suspended 56 times. This is a simple and consistent process. We urge you to contact your representatives and urge them to support abolishing the debt ceiling, eliminating the statutory limit on federal borrowing.<br><br>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, which are their misunderstanding of the judging criterion, their assertion that the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility, and their claim that abolishing the debt ceiling would undermine confidence in U.S. debt.<br><br>First, concerning the judging criterion, while the opposition claims to value "fiscal stability and responsible governance," we contend that this is inherently dependent on a strong U.S. economy. Our focus on achieving the most beneficial outcome for the U.S. economy is not separate from fiscal stability, but rather the *foundation* upon which it rests. Abolishing the debt ceiling directly contributes to fiscal stability by preventing the manufactured crises and potential defaults that arise from political brinkmanship . As Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned, a default could cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy . Therefore, our criterion of the most beneficial economic outcome is, in fact, the most direct path to achieving their stated goal of fiscal stability and responsible governance.<br><br>Second, the opposition argues that the debt ceiling promotes fiscal responsibility by requiring legislative consent. However, this is demonstrably false. The debt ceiling has historically been a catalyst for political standoffs and near-defaults, undermining fiscal responsibility rather than promoting it . The 2011 debt ceiling crisis, for example, led to a downgrade of the U.S. credit rating and increased borrowing costs for the government . The debt ceiling does not effectively control spending; it merely provides an opportunity for political hostage-taking. The fact that both sides benefit when agreements are reached shows that the debt ceiling does nothing to push either side to agree, as any agreement would be better than a default.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that abolishing the debt ceiling could undermine confidence in U.S. debt. We argue the opposite is true. The very *existence* of the debt ceiling introduces uncertainty and the risk of default, which inherently *harms* investor confidence. Brookings Institution notes that "bickering over the debt ceiling...creates unnecessary uncertainty, threatens the benefits of issuing the world's safest asset" . Removing this artificial constraint would reassure investors that the U.S. is committed to meeting its obligations, thereby *strengthening* our financial standing. Furthermore, if the U.S. fails to raise the debt ceiling, confidence plummets, causing financial crises.<br><br>
