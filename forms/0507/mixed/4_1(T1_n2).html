                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss the crucial role that processed foods should play in sustainable food systems. To ensure a productive conversation, let's define our terms. "Processed foods" encompass any transformation beyond basic cleaning or cutting, including preservation and packaging. A "sustainable food system," as we define it, minimizes environmental harm, is economically sound, and provides nutritional security for all, without jeopardizing future generations.<br><br>When evaluating our arguments today, we should prioritize those that demonstrably improve food security and environmental sustainability, especially for our most vulnerable populations.<br><br>With that in mind, I will present three key arguments demonstrating why processed foods are not just relevant, but essential, to building sustainable food systems.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly enhance food security by extending shelf life and drastically reducing waste. Unlike fresh produce, which spoils rapidly, processed foods offer a longer shelf life. This extended usability reduces spoilage, making food available for longer periods and in more locations. *Food Safety*, a trusted resource on food-related topics, reports that studies show about 50 percent of consumer food waste can be prevented by extending the shelf life of the food product. This is particularly critical in regions with limited access to fresh food or unreliable supply chains. Moreover, *a 2019 study* highlights that wastage of processed fruits and vegetables is approximately 14% lower than that of fresh produce. This demonstrates the power of processing to minimize waste across the supply chain.<br><br>Second, processed foods are often more accessible and affordable than fresh produce, especially for individuals with limited time for meal preparation, disabilities that make cooking difficult, or those living in areas with limited transportation options. While we acknowledge concerns about the nutritional profile of some processed foods, it's important to recognize that they provide essential calories and nutrients to individuals who would otherwise struggle to obtain sufficient nourishment. According to *The Annie E. Casey Foundation in 2024*, meals rich in vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts are, on average, $1.50 more expensive per day than diets rich in processed foods, meats, and refined grains. Furthermore, *WebMD* notes that U.S. food producers have been fortifying foods since the 1920s to prevent nutrition-related illnesses.<br><br>Third, processing enables the utilization of agricultural byproducts and waste streams, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. As highlighted in *a 2021 study in PMC*, extrusion processing can be an excellent avenue for the utilization of these by-products in foods.<br><br>Therefore, processed foods are not the antithesis of a sustainable food system; they are, in fact, a critical tool for achieving it, and should be considered by individuals, and supported by policymakers.<br>***<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is detrimental to overall sustainability due to their environmental impact, adverse health effects, and the hindering of more sustainable alternatives. We define **processed foods** as foods altered from their natural state through methods like canning, freezing, drying, or the addition of additives . A **sustainable food system** is one that provides food security and nutrition for current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same, being environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially equitable .<br><br>Our judging criteria prioritize **holistic sustainability**, meaning the judge should favor the side that best promotes environmental health, human well-being, and the long-term viability of food systems. Arguments favoring processed foods should be rejected if they significantly harm any of these core pillars, even if offering short-term gains in areas like affordability.<br><br>First, increasing reliance on processed foods exacerbates environmental degradation. Processed food production relies on resource-intensive agriculture, contributing to deforestation and high greenhouse gas emissions . For example, the production of ultra-processed foods contributes heavily to waste and emissions, undermining environmental sustainability . Studies show that processed food production significantly harms the environment through land degradation and increased food waste . This reliance on intensive farming methods and non-biodegradable packaging further strains our planet's resources . Thus, the environmental costs associated with processed foods outweigh any perceived benefits in a sustainable system.<br><br>Second, a greater role for processed foods undermines human health. These foods are often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, leading to increased rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes . Research indicates that ultra-processed foods are particularly concerning due to their association with numerous health issues . Increased consumption of processed foods is linked to higher risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, ultra-processed foods are associated with numerous health issues . Therefore, promoting processed foods undermines the goal of creating healthy, resilient populations.<br><br>Third, prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of more sustainable alternatives. Focusing on processed foods distracts from investing in regenerative agriculture, local food systems, and plant-based diets, which offer long-term benefits for both the environment and human health . Sustainable food systems promote healthy alternatives to processed foods, emphasizing local, fresh produce . Specifically, these systems reduce environmental impact and support community health by growing and consuming locally sourced foods . Prioritizing processed foods diverts resources and attention from more sustainable and beneficial practices, hindering the transition to a truly sustainable food system.<br><br>In conclusion, increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is counterproductive. It worsens environmental problems, harms human health, and impedes the development of genuinely sustainable alternatives. We urge the judge to oppose this motion and support a future where food systems prioritize health, environment, and long-term viability.<br><br></div>

We'll clarify key definitions and demonstrate how processed foods are crucial for a truly sustainable food system, especially when considering the needs of vulnerable populations.<br><br>First, let's address the definition of processed foods. The opponent defines it too narrowly. Our definition includes basic preservation and packaging techniques. These steps are vital for reducing waste and extending shelf life, which are essential for sustainability. It's an oversimplification to exclude these processes, as they directly impact food availability and reduce overall waste in the supply chain. According to *KHNI*, extending the shelf life of food products has rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to support and promote sustainability .<br><br>Second, we reinforce the core principles of a sustainable food system. It minimizes environmental harm, is economically sound, and provides nutritional security for all, without jeopardizing future generations. Arguments that improve food security and environmental sustainability, especially for our most vulnerable populations, should be prioritized. These are the metrics to evaluate our arguments.<br><br>Third, processed foods significantly enhance food security. They extend shelf life and drastically reduce waste. As *the BBC reported in 2021*, ultra-processed foods can help reduce emissions because they are made to last longer, so we're less likely to waste them . While the opponent may point to wastage of processed fruits and vegetables being approximately 14% lower than that of fresh produce, we must consider the broader impact.<br><br>Fourth, processed foods are often more accessible and affordable, especially for those with limited time, disabilities, or transportation challenges. Meals rich in fresh foods are significantly more expensive, particularly in food deserts. *The Food Revolution Network* points out that food subsidies have caused the price of processed foods and industrial meat to decrease by 20-30% over the last four decades, while the price of fruits and vegetables has increased by 40% .<br><br>Fifth, processing enables the utilization of agricultural byproducts and waste streams, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. This contributes to resource efficiency. By adopting a circular economy approach, by-product utilization in agriculture will flourish. Rather than treating by-products as wastes, there is a growing trend to integrate them into the production process.<br><br>Now, let's address the opponent's concerns. We acknowledge that the production of *some* processed foods can have a significant environmental footprint. However, advancements in sustainable processing and packaging offer opportunities to dramatically reduce these impacts. For example, *ScienceDirect* highlights that technologies like microwaves, ultrasound, and nonthermal plasma are rapidly being adapted by the food industry to save production resources and improve food quality .<br><br>They also claim processed foods undermine human health. While *Harvard Health* notes in a 2024 review that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher risks of certain health issues, they also acknowledge that some ultra-processed whole-grain breads, breakfast cereals, and yogurts were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .<br><br>Finally, they argue that prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of more sustainable alternatives. This is a false dilemma. We can and should invest in both.<br><br>Therefore, processed foods are an important key to food sustainability.<br><br>

Esteemed judges ladies and gentlemen the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws. Which are their narrow definition of processed foods? They're vague judging criteria of holistic sustainability. And their claims about mental and health impacts. First the opposition defines processed foods too narrowly. Focusing only on alterations like canning and adding additives. This definition doesn't reflect the reality of modern food systems. Almost all foods undergo some form of processing. Even simple washing and packaging. Food science recognizes that processing encompasses a wide range of techniques. That improved safety extend shelf life. An enhanced nutrient availability 1. By trying to narrowly define processed foods. To include only the unhealthiest options. They created a distorted picture of what we are actually advocating for. Therefore. We maintain that our broader definition. Encompassing all transformations beyond basic cleaning is more accurate and reflects the reality of modern food systems. This ensures a more comprehensive and relevant debate. The opposition's judging criteria of holistic sustainability is too vague and can be easily manipulated. While we agree that environmental health and human well-being are important prioritizing food security is a necessary component of any truly sustainable system. People cannot focus on long-term environmental goals if they are struggling to access sufficient and affordable food today. Our focus is on ensuring that everyone has access to nutritious food and processed foods play a vital role in achieving that goal. Thus we assert that food security must be a central pillar of sustainability not a secondary consideration. This allows for policies that address immediate needs while striving for long-term sustainability. Third our opponents claim that processed foods always lead to environmental degradation. But this is simply not true. Many processed foods actually reduce emissions by preventing spoilage. Utilizing agricultural by-products and requiring less transportation than fresh alternatives. Moreover innovations in sustainable food processing such as ai and advanced technologies are further reducing the environmental impact of these foods for six. For example canned tomatoes and frozen fruits due to their efficient supply chains and reduced spoilage. Can i have a lower carbon footprint than fresh produce transported over long distances. Therefore their claim of inherent environmental harm is demonstrably false and processed foods can in many cases. Contribute to a more environmentally sound food system. The opposition equates all processed foods with unhealthy options high in sugar and fat. But this is a straw man argument. We are not advocating for only unhealthy processed foods many processed foods are fortified with essential nutrients and can be a part of a healthy diet. Especially for those with limited access to fresh produce. In fact studies show that meals rich in vegetables fruits fish and nuts are on average $1.50 more expensive per day than diets including processed foods. This refutes their assertion that processed foods are inherently unhealthy. And highlights their crucial role in providing affordable nutrition to vulnerable populations. The opposition claims that prioritizing processed foods. Prevents investing in regenerative agriculture and local food systems. This is a false dile. We can and should invest in both. Processed foods can actually support sustainable agriculture by providing a market for imperfect produce an agricultural byproduct. Food processing can help increase the convenience in variety of available foods. This leads to increased consumption which in turn supports local farmers.<br><br>
