                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Okay, I'm the Reviewer. Here's my feedback on the opening statement:<br><br>**Overall:** The opening statement is well-structured and presents a strong case for mandatory wage transparency. The arguments are logically sound and supported by the evidence provided by the Searcher. The definitions and judging criteria are also clearly stated. However, there are a few areas where the script can be improved:<br><br>**Specific Feedback:**<br><br>1.  **Citations:** Need to include in-text citations and a reference list.<br>2.  **Argument 1: Reducing the Gender Pay Gap:** While you mention the OECD, Forbes, World Bank, and a Canadian study, you need to be more specific with the data. For example, instead of just saying "pay transparency policies have been associated with a decrease in the gender wage gap," provide specific figures .<br>3.  **Argument 2: Promoting Economic Benefits:** You mention that a SHRM study indicates that "70% of organizations listing pay ranges on job postings experienced more applicants, and 66% saw an increase in applicant quality." Clarify who SHRM is  and add how that translates to economic benefits.<br>4.  **Argument 3: Addressing Discrimination:** While the argument is valid, it could be strengthened by providing more specific examples of how pay transparency helps combat discrimination. Perhaps include a statistic about the wage gap for women of color and how transparency can help close that gap.<br>5.  **Language:** The language is generally strong, but consider varying sentence structure and word choice to make it even more persuasive.<br><br>**Actionable Items:**<br><br>1.  Add in-text citations and a reference list.<br>2.  Provide specific data points and numbers in each argument to strengthen the claims.<br>3.  Clarify the connection between increased applicants/applicant quality  and the economic benefits for companies.<br>4.  Add more specific examples or data related to addressing discrimination, particularly for women of color.<br><br>I will now hand the document back to the Writer to implement these revisions.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We're here today to discuss mandatory wage transparency laws and whether they should be implemented to address the gender wage gap. We firmly stand against this motion. While the intention behind these laws is good, the approach is fundamentally flawed.<br><br>Our position is that mandatory wage transparency laws simply do not address the root causes of the gender wage gap. It's a complex issue influenced by many factors beyond just direct discrimination. Think of it like trying to fix a problem with your phone by only changing the wallpaper. It might look different, but the real issues are still there. The wage gap is similarly influenced by career choices, work-life balance preferences, and even negotiation styles. For example, women are often drawn to fields such as nursing and teaching that, while vital to society, may not command the highest salaries compared to fields like engineering. Is this necessarily discrimination, or is it a reflection of different career paths and societal values? These choices aren't inherently discriminatory, but they significantly impact overall earnings. Negotiation styles also play a role. According to research, men negotiate salaries more often than women. In fact, *Gender Differences in Negotiation and Policy for...* found that men initiate salary negotiations 7% more often than women. Transparency alone cannot solve these underlying issues. By focusing solely on transparency, we risk creating a system that's more about the appearance of fairness than actual progress toward equity. We need to dig deeper and address the real drivers behind the wage gap, not just its symptoms. Instead of solely focusing on transparency, let's invest in programs that encourage women in STEM and support equal parental leave for both parents, fostering true equality. Increased female representation in STEM fields can lead to higher earning potential and reduce the overall wage gap. Equal parental leave allows women to remain in the workforce without sacrificing career advancement opportunities.<br><br>Furthermore, wage transparency laws could disproportionately harm small businesses. Small businesses often operate with fewer resources and less structured compensation systems than large corporations. Imagine a local coffee shop versus a multinational chain. The coffee shop owner likely handles payroll and HR themselves, while the large corporation has dedicated departments. The coffee shop is far more vulnerable to scrutiny and potential lawsuits triggered by salary transparency. It’s like asking a bicycle to compete in a race against a sports car. According to *SHRM in 2024*, many employers, particularly smaller ones, fear that wage transparency will hurt recruiting and speed up turnover when employees and candidates see how much more they could earn elsewhere .<br><br>Implementing wage transparency laws can also be costly and time-consuming for businesses, especially small ones. Companies must invest in systems to collect, manage, and disclose salary data. Resources that could be used for innovation, employee training, or even just staying afloat are diverted to compliance. It’s like choosing to spend money on a fancy new filing cabinet when you really need a new computer. *Sixfifty.com* reports that violations of wage transparency laws can cost businesses thousands of dollars per incident .<br><br>In conclusion, we firmly believe that mandatory wage transparency laws are not the answer. They fail to address the root causes of the wage gap, disproportionately harm small businesses, and divert resources from more productive activities.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws: their misrepresentation of the root cause of the gender wage gap, exaggeration of the harm to small businesses, and neglect of the long-term benefits of wage transparency.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that mandatory wage transparency doesn't address the "root causes" of the gender wage gap, attributing it primarily to career choices, negotiation styles, and work-life balance preferences. However, this argument employs a **Red Herring**, attempting to distract us from the persistent issue of pay discrimination. While those factors play a role, research consistently reveals that a significant portion of the wage gap remains unexplained *even after* considering these elements . The OECD, in their 2021 report, states that pay transparency measures are particularly important for addressing the discriminatory wage gap, i.e., the part of the gender wage gap that cannot be attributed to observable worker characteristics . Moreover, pay transparency can **inform** career choices by showing women which fields offer equitable pay, **empower** negotiation by providing salary ranges, and create **pressure** for more equitable work-life balance policies as companies compete for talent. According to a study by HBR in 2022, companies adopting pay transparency policies foster an engaged and positive working environment that builds trust .<br><br>Second, the negative claims that wage transparency disproportionately harms small businesses, vaguely referencing SHRM. However, many states only require employers with 50 or more employees to adhere to such laws. Furthermore, larger corporations often have dedicated HR departments to handle these issues, giving them an advantage that transparency laws can actually help balance by standardizing practices. Besides, wage transparency laws will shift societal expectations to value wage fairness for businesses large and small. Studies from NWLC show that organizations listing pay ranges on job postings experience more people applying to their postings and see an increase in the quality of job applicants .<br><br>Third, the negative argues that wage transparency is costly and time-consuming, diverting resources from innovation and training. However, this presents a **False Dilemma** because companies can invest in compliance *and* continue to innovate and train their employees. The long-term benefits of increased employee morale, reduced turnover, and avoidance of costly discrimination lawsuits far outweigh the initial implementation costs. According to NWLC, a recent survey found that the perception of pay transparency in the workplace decreases intent to leave by 30% .<br><br>By implementing mandatory wage transparency laws, we are not just changing the wallpaper, we are rebuilding the foundation of a fair and equitable economy.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate the opposition's perspective, but we firmly believe that mandatory wage transparency is not the right solution to address the gender wage gap. Our arguments will demonstrate why this approach is misguided and potentially harmful.<br><br>First, let's address the core issue: the claim that wage transparency effectively tackles the root causes of the gender wage gap. While the opposition dismisses our argument, it's crucial to understand the multifaceted nature of this problem. As we've emphasized, factors such as career choices, work-life balance preferences, and negotiation styles significantly influence wage disparities. Mandatory wage transparency alone cannot alter these fundamental dynamics. Instead, we need targeted interventions. For instance, initiatives that encourage women's participation in STEM fields and the provision of equitable parental leave policies are more effective. According to studies on women and negotiation, men tend to achieve better economic results in negotiation than women. If men ask for and receive slightly higher starting salaries than women, for example, and continue to negotiate more assertively for themselves, the gender gap in negotiation will increase. Therefore, a singular focus on transparency creates a false sense of progress without addressing these underlying determinants.<br><br>Second, let's consider the impact on small businesses. The opposition points out that many states offer exemptions for small businesses under these laws. However, even navigating these exemptions and ensuring compliance demands resources that small businesses often lack. These businesses could face significant legal and financial risks for misinterpreting or misusing wage data under transparency laws. As reported in the *National Law Review*, employers may face varying degrees of liability if they fail to comply with pay transparency laws. Moreover, transparency can negatively affect recruiting efforts and increase employee turnover. Therefore, wage transparency laws could disproportionately burden small businesses, hindering their growth and competitiveness. As an alternative, we should focus on supporting small businesses through mentorship programs and access to resources that promote fair hiring practices.<br><br>Third, we must address the cost implications. The opposition characterizes our concerns about the cost and time required to implement these laws as a "false dilemma." However, for small businesses, compliance costs can represent a substantial financial strain. It's not merely the initial investment; it's the ongoing expenses associated with data collection, management, and potential legal consultation. As a result, small businesses might be compelled to reduce investments in crucial areas such as employee training or innovation to accommodate these compliance requirements. According to a 2025 update, penalties for non-compliance can range from $100 to $10,000 per violation. Therefore, wage transparency laws can impose significant financial and administrative burdens on businesses, particularly small ones.<br><br>Finally, the opposition asserts that transparency reduces the wage gap and combats discrimination. While they cite various organizations, they fail to provide concrete evidence to support this claim. In fact, wage transparency can have negative impacts for employees as well. As stated in a 2016 article for the *Harvard Business Review*, faculty who discovered they were being paid less than their peers became much less satisfied with their jobs and more likely to say they might leave. Therefore, their claims lack the necessary factual basis and overlook the potential for unintended negative consequences.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around whether mandatory wage transparency laws should be implemented to address the gender wage gap. The core of our argument is that wage transparency is essential for addressing the discriminatory portion of the gender wage gap. The part that remains unexplained even after accounting for factors like career choices and negotiation. The opposition has attempted to distract from this by focusing on these other factors. However the oecd clearly states that pay transparency is vital for tackling this discriminatory wage gap 1. Transparency informs career choices by revealing equitable pay in different fields empowers negotiation by providing salary benchmarks and creates pressure for equitable work-life balance policies. As companies compete for talent. The opposition's claim that these factors are fundamental dynamics is inaccurate. Transparency reshapes them over time. Driving societal change and promoting equity. We acknowledge the opposition's concerns about the impact on small businesses. But these concerns are overblown. Many states offer exemptions for businesses below a certain size. Furthermore larger companies already bear hr and compliance costs so salary transparency laws actually level the playing field rather than creating an uneven advantage. The society for human resource management reports that many organizations listing pay ranges on job postings experienced a larger and more qualified applicant pool. This translates into economic benefits through better hires and reduced turnover. The long-term benefits of increased employee morale and reduced discrimination lawsuit. Far outweigh the initial costs the costs of compliance are not crippling. The costs of not complying are far greater.<br><br></div>

Are discussion primarily revolved around whether mandatory wage transparency laws are an effective solution. For addressing the gender wage gap. And whether the potential benefits outweigh the costs and unintended consequences. Our team has demonstrated that mandatory wage transparency is a superficial solution. While discrimination is a real problem the affirmative has failed to provide concrete evidence that transparency laws directly reduced discriminatory pay gaps. Career choices work-life balance preferences and negotiation styles all significantly influence wage disparities for. As studies on women and negotiation show men tend to achieve better economic results in negotiation than women. These are complex issues that transparency alone cannot solve. We agreed discrimination exists but initiatives like stem programs and equal parental leave are more direct and effective in combating it. Furthermore we have shown that wage transparency laws disproportionately harm small businesses. Even navigating exemptions and ensuring compliance requires resources they often lack. These businesses face potential legal and financial risks for misinterpreting or misusing wage data too. For example. Penalties for non-compliance can range from 100 to 10,000 per violation. The affirmative brings up that nwlc shows that organizations listing pay ranges. Experience more people applying to their postings. And see an increase in the quality of job applicants. But this study doesn't measure small business impacts and isn't reliable in this particular battleground. The cost of implementing these laws are not justified by the potential benefits. Compliance diverts resources from crucial areas like employee training and innovation. Penalties for non-compliance can range from 100 to 10,000 per violation.<br><br>

We maintain that mandatory wage transparency is not the answer.<br><br>Firstly, our opponents oversimplify the issue by focusing solely on discrimination. As *Harvard Business Review* has noted, numerous factors influence earnings, including career choices, work-life balance preferences, and individual negotiation skills. Wage transparency cannot magically erase these fundamental dynamics. It's a superficial fix for a complex problem.<br><br>Secondly, mandatory wage transparency disproportionately burdens small businesses. *The Society for Human Resource Management * has reported that these businesses face significant compliance costs, diverting resources from crucial investments like employee development and innovation. Exemptions offer little real relief, and the risk of increased employee turnover becomes a serious threat.<br><br>Thirdly, these laws are undeniably expensive. Resources are diverted from vital areas such as innovation and employee training. *A 2023 report by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce* highlights that penalties for non-compliance can be devastating, potentially leading to business closures. These costs can be the deciding factor between prosperity and failure for a small business.<br><br>In conclusion, mandatory wage transparency is a deeply flawed solution. The disadvantages far outweigh any perceived benefits. We need targeted strategies that address the underlying causes of the gender wage gap, such as promoting STEM education for women and providing better access to affordable childcare. Therefore, we strongly urge you to oppose this motion and seek more effective, less damaging solutions.
