                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that integrating AI tutors into the classroom is not merely a futuristic possibility, but a necessary step to revolutionize education, enhance learning outcomes, and ensure equitable access to quality education for all students. We define an AI Tutor as an artificial intelligence-powered system designed to provide personalized instruction, answer questions, and track student progress . We define the classroom as a learning environment where students and educators interact, whether physical or virtual.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing educational outcomes. The side that demonstrates the greatest potential for enhancing student learning, improving access to quality education, and supporting effective teaching practices should win this debate.<br><br>First, AI Tutors Personalize Learning, Leading to Improved Outcomes. AI tutors can adapt to individual student needs and learning styles, providing tailored instruction and immediate feedback. This personalization leads to increased engagement, motivation, and ultimately, better learning outcomes. A new study from Harvard, currently under peer review, found that students given access to an AI tutor designed using pedagogical principles doubled their learning gains in less time than traditional methods . This study, which included 900 tutors and 1,800 elementary and secondary school students from a large school district in the South, highlights the transformative potential of AI in delivering personalized education at scale . Furthermore, a Californian high school reported a 30% improvement in math test scores over one semester among students using AI tutoring compared to those who did not . By catering to individual learning styles and providing immediate feedback, AI tutors foster a more engaging and effective learning environment, leading to significant improvements in student performance.<br><br>Second, AI Tutors Increase Access to Quality Education. AI tutors can break down geographical and economic barriers, providing affordable and accessible education to students who may not have access to traditional tutoring or high-quality schools. One critical benefit of AI tutors is lower costs, which could support equitable access . Khan Academy’s Khanmigo, an AI tutoring tool powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4, costs only $4 a month . This affordability makes quality education accessible to students from all socioeconomic backgrounds, leveling the playing field and democratizing learning opportunities. Moreover, AI tutors can provide personalized assistance to each student, regardless of their geographical or socioeconomic status, helping to fill the achievement gap in schooling . By breaking down barriers to access, AI tutors ensure that all students have the opportunity to reach their full potential.<br><br>Third, AI Tutors Support Teachers and Enhance Teaching Practices. Contrary to concerns that AI might replace teachers, integrating AI in education is designed to enhance, not replace, human interaction . AI tutors support teachers by automating routine tasks and providing personalized student support, allowing educators to focus on teaching . With AI tutors taking care of some of the content delivery outside of class, teachers can devote more time to fostering meaningful interactions with their students during class . Studies show that when human tutors used an AI app, Tutor CoPilot, their students were 4 percentage points more likely to master mathematics topics than students whose tutors did not have access to the app . By automating administrative tasks and providing data-driven insights, AI tutors free up teachers' time and enable them to focus on personalized instruction and student engagement, ultimately enhancing teaching practices and improving student outcomes.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate our opponents laying out their vision for AI in the classroom. However, we stand firm that the rush to embrace AI tutors overlooks critical considerations. We will address their claims directly. While our opponents define AI Tutors, Classrooms, and argue for maximizing educational outcomes, their claims are not fully supported by evidence and overlook several critical issues, such as the potential for bias in AI training data and the need for human interaction. Personalized learning comes at the cost of essential human interaction and the development of crucial soft skills. AI tutors cannot replace the crucial role of human educators in fostering critical thinking and creativity.<br><br>We agree that maximizing educational outcomes is a worthy goal. However, we must consider all factors, not just test scores. Maximizing educational outcomes needs to take into account issues of fairness, accountability, and cost-effectiveness. It is not enough to simply improve access; we must also ensure equitable access for all students.<br><br>First, AI tutors may perpetuate existing biases present in their training data, leading to unfair educational outcomes. Erin Mote, the co-founder and executive director of InnovateEDU, a national nonprofit that seeks to build school districts' capacity on policy and technology, emphasized in *2024* that AI tools are "as biased as we are because they have been trained on us" . This potential for bias directly contradicts the opponent's claim of "improved outcomes". If AI is trained on biased datasets, it can unintentionally discriminate against certain student groups. For example, studies have shown that facial recognition software, often used in AI training, demonstrates higher error rates for people of color. The 'improved outcomes' our opponents cite may be skewed by the data used to train these AI tutors, potentially reinforcing existing inequalities.<br><br>Second, the lack of transparency in AI algorithms used by tutors raises concerns about accountability and fairness. A *2023 ScienceDirect* study investigated the sources of bias and risks posed by AI systems applied in auditing . This lack of transparency means that if an AI tutor consistently recommends simpler problems for students from a specific demographic, educators and parents have no way of knowing whether this is due to the student's actual needs or a hidden bias in the algorithm. This makes it impossible to ensure fair and equitable learning experiences.<br><br>Third, the high initial investment and maintenance costs of AI tutoring systems strain already limited education budgets. According to *AI Pricing: How Much Does Artificial Intelligence Cost In 2025?*, AI-powered learning platforms may start as low as $50/month for educators and go up to $50,000+ for enterprise-grade systems . While AI-powered learning platforms can cost up to $50,000+ for enterprise-grade systems, this is often comparable to or even exceeds the cost of hiring several experienced human tutors to provide personalized support for students. The over-reliance on AI tutors can lead to a deskilling of the teaching profession, reducing teachers to mere facilitators and undermining their expertise and autonomy. This can lead to lower morale, decreased job satisfaction, and ultimately, a decline in the quality of education.<br><br>In conclusion, while AI tutors offer some potential benefits, we believe that the risks outweigh the rewards. We urge you to demand further research into the biases inherent in these systems, the lack of transparency, and the financial burden before welcoming AI tutors into the classroom. Thank you.<br><br></div>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opposition's arguments contain several flaws, specifically regarding bias, transparency, cost, and the role of teachers. These supposed risks fail to outweigh the benefits of AI tutors in maximizing educational outcomes, including fairness, accountability, and cost-effectiveness.<br><br>First, the opposition claims AI tutors perpetuate existing biases , but they fail to provide concrete evidence of this occurring within AI tutoring systems themselves. While the *potential* for bias in AI is a valid concern, it's a red herring unless shown to be a *current* problem in this specific application. Furthermore, bias is not unique to AI; human teachers also hold biases, often unconsciously. However, unlike the "black box" of the human mind, AI algorithms can be audited and corrected for bias . This leads to *greater* accountability compared to unaudited human educators. Therefore, the move towards AI tutors, if anything, *increases* our ability to identify and mitigate bias in education, directly *enhancing* fairness and maximizing educational outcomes.<br><br>Second, the opposition raises concerns about the lack of transparency in AI algorithms . But transparency is a goal, not a given, in *any* educational method. Can we truly know every factor that influences a teacher's grading? Moreover, lack of complete transparency doesn't automatically equate to unfairness. Many AI tutoring systems are designed with explainability features, allowing educators to understand the AI's reasoning . The increasing use of AI in education necessitates, and is driving, the development of robust transparency and accountability standards, ensuring fair and equitable learning experiences for all students and maximizing educational outcomes in a responsible manner.<br><br>Third, the opposition cites the high costs of AI tutoring , but their figures are vague and lack context. The reality is, AI tutoring offers a *scalable* solution. While costs vary, options like Khan Academy's Khanmigo demonstrate that high-quality AI tutoring can be accessible for as little as $4 a month . These costs are often less than those of human tutors . This affordability dramatically *increases* access to quality education, particularly for underserved communities. Therefore, AI tutors can offer cost-effective solutions that maximize educational outcomes by reaching more students with personalized support.<br><br>Finally, the opposition suggests AI tutors will lead to the "deskilling" of teachers . This claim is unfounded. AI tutors are designed to *augment* teachers, not replace them . By automating routine tasks and providing data-driven insights, AI tutors free teachers to focus on fostering critical thinking, creativity, and social-emotional learning – skills that AI cannot replicate . This ultimately *improves* teacher effectiveness and job satisfaction, *enhancing* the overall quality of education and thus, maximizing educational outcomes.<br><br>In conclusion, the opponent's arguments are based on hypothetical risks and incomplete information. We believe that by embracing AI tutors thoughtfully and ethically, we can revolutionize education, improve learning outcomes, ensure equitable access, and support teachers in creating a more effective and engaging learning environment for all. AI tutors maximize educational outcomes, fairly, accountably, and cost-effectively.<br><br>

Let's directly address these concerns.<br><br>First, let's tackle the issues of potential bias in AI and the need for human interaction. It's true that AI, like any human creation, can reflect biases present in its training data. However, it's wrong to assume that biased data is an inherent and unchangeable aspect of AI. *Edutopia* reports that there are ongoing efforts to reduce biases in AI algorithms used in education through techniques like reweighting data samples and adversarial debiasing during model training. It's also important to remember that human teachers also have biases that can unintentionally affect student outcomes. The key is accountability and continuous improvement. We can implement human review processes to identify and correct biases that may occur in AI outputs, ensuring fairness and equity.<br><br>Second, let's reinforce how intelligent tutoring systems personalize learning and increase access to quality education. AI can provide deeper insights into student learning patterns compared to traditional methods. According to *a 2023 article in Smart Learning Environments*, AI can analyze students' learning patterns and develop customized approaches, maximizing each student's learning experience. For example, the SCALE Initiative at Stanford Graduate School of Education published research in *May 2024* showing that students using AI tutors learn more than twice as much in less time compared to active learning classes. This demonstrates the efficacy of AI in enhancing learning outcomes. While our opponents argue that personalized learning comes at the cost of essential human interaction, the integration of adaptive learning technologies doesn't eliminate human interaction. Instead, it transforms the role of teachers, allowing them to focus on collaborative projects, leading class discussions, and providing individualized mentorship.<br><br>Third, let's address the concerns about cost and teacher deskilling. While implementing AI-powered learning platforms involves an initial investment, the long-term benefits, such as improved student outcomes and increased teacher efficiency, outweigh these costs. Furthermore, the argument that over-reliance on AI tutors can deskill the teaching profession is a misconception. *Microsoft* states that AI tutoring scaffolds frustration-free student advancement. AI can handle personalized instruction and identify learning gaps in struggling students, freeing up teachers to dedicate more time to facilitating collaborative projects, leading class discussions, and providing individualized mentorship. For example, *the NSTA* suggests that AI can be used as a resource for exploration rather than a shortcut to solutions, encouraging students to use AI-generated data as a starting point for class debates or group projects, which promotes collaborative problem-solving and critical analysis.<br><br>Our opponents present a false dilemma, suggesting we must choose between fixing systemic issues and using AI tutors. AI tutors are tools that can support and enhance, not replace, comprehensive educational reform. Therefore, I urge you to support initiatives that promote responsible AI development and implementation in education. Let's advocate for funding for bias mitigation research, support pilot programs for AI tutors in schools, and participate in discussions about the ethical implications of AI in education.<br><br>Ultimately, integrating AI-powered learning tools is a necessary step to revolutionize education, enhance learning outcomes, and ensure equitable access to quality education for all students. Thank you.<br><br>
