                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that when healthcare resources are demonstrably scarce, the government should intervene to ration care, thereby deciding whose life is worth saving, based on principles of maximizing overall societal well-being and ensuring equitable distribution. We define "health care" as services provided by healthcare professionals to maintain or improve a person's health; "scarce resource" as a resource for which demand exceeds supply; "rationing" as a process of allocating limited resources in a controlled manner; "government" as the governing body responsible for policies; and "worth saving" as a valuation of life based on potential for future contribution and quality of life. Our judging criteria is utilitarianism: the side that demonstrates the greatest overall good for the greatest number of people should prevail.<br><br>First, government intervention ensures a more equitable allocation of scarce healthcare resources. The Santa Clara University's Markkula Center for Applied Ethics highlights the economic rationality of healthcare rationing, noting the scarcity of resources amidst increased demand . Without government oversight, healthcare access is largely determined by socioeconomic status, exacerbating existing inequalities. As the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School notes, resources spent on one patient mean fewer resources for others, necessitating governmental decisions for the common good . Government intervention, through transparent and standardized protocols, aims to distribute these limited resources more justly, addressing the inherent inequities of a market-based healthcare system.<br><br>Second, government rationing maximizes societal benefit by prioritizing those with the highest likelihood of recovery and future contribution. A utilitarian approach dictates that resources should be allocated to achieve the greatest overall good. For example, diverting resources from an elderly, retired population to younger members of society who are more likely to be working can increase economic productivity . Triage protocols, as utilized during crises, prioritize individuals with the highest probability of survival . While ethically challenging, this approach ensures that scarce resources are used to maximize the number of productive life years saved, thus benefiting society as a whole.<br><br>Third, government oversight is crucial in preventing discrimination and bias in healthcare rationing decisions. An article in The Regulatory Review notes that, to maintain public trust, governments should implement processes that protect against bias and other forms of institutional discrimination . Absent government intervention, implicit biases and discriminatory practices can influence resource allocation, leading to unjust outcomes. By establishing clear, objective criteria and monitoring their implementation, the government can mitigate these biases and ensure that rationing decisions are based on medical need and potential for recovery, rather than on factors such as race, socioeconomic status, or other irrelevant considerations.<br><br>In conclusion, we firmly believe that government intervention in healthcare rationing, when resources are scarce, is not only necessary but ethically imperative. By ensuring equitable allocation, maximizing societal benefit, and preventing discrimination, government rationing provides the best framework for navigating the difficult choices inherent in a world of limited healthcare resources.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine being told that your life isn't "worth saving" according to a government algorithm. This is the chilling reality of the opposition's proposal: that when healthcare is a scarce resource, the government should step in to ration care, deciding whose life is worth saving. We stand firmly opposed to this resolution. While we acknowledge the challenges of resource scarcity, we believe that government intervention in this manner is not the answer. We will demonstrate that this approach devalues human life, harms vulnerable populations, and is susceptible to corruption.<br><br>First, let's address the heart of the matter: the idea that the government should decide "whose life is worth saving." This concept is inherently dangerous. The opposition's definition of "worth saving," based on "potential for future contribution and quality of life," is subjective and discriminatory. How can any government fairly and accurately assess an individual's future potential? Such criteria inevitably lead to the devaluation of individuals based on arbitrary standards. We also reject the utilitarian criteria. While maximizing overall well-being seems appealing, it can easily justify sacrificing the rights and needs of vulnerable minorities for the perceived benefit of the majority. Utilitarianism offers no safeguard against tyranny of the majority and fails to protect the inherent dignity of every human life.<br><br>Second, government rationing of healthcare inherently devalues human life by creating an arbitrary worth based on selected criteria. When healthcare is rationed based on government-defined factors, it inevitably assigns different values to individuals. This leads to ethical concerns and potential discrimination. According to *a 2020 article in PMC*, criteria such as "life-years saved" or "long-term predicted life expectancy," although not referencing age directly, will predictably disadvantage older people relative to younger people. This contradicts the fundamental principle that all human lives have intrinsic value, regardless of their potential or quality of life.<br><br>Third, government-imposed healthcare rationing can disproportionately harm vulnerable populations who lack the resources to navigate complex bureaucratic systems. Marginalized groups, such as the elderly, disabled, and low-income individuals, may face even greater barriers to accessing needed care under a rationing system. These populations often lack the resources and advocacy needed to navigate complex bureaucratic systems, making them particularly vulnerable to being denied essential care. These potential harms of rationing underscore the need for alternative solutions that improve healthcare access and efficiency without sacrificing fundamental ethical principles. Investing in preventative care and telemedicine, for instance, can alleviate resource constraints and improve access for vulnerable populations.<br><br>Finally, we want to address the framing of this debate. The opposition uses emotionally charged language, suggesting that without government intervention, healthcare will be unfairly distributed based solely on socioeconomic status. However, this presents a false choice. Instead of resorting to rationing, we should focus on improving healthcare efficiency and promoting preventative care to alleviate resource constraints. According to *research from PMC in 2020*, a transition from disease treatment to prevention can reduce the incidence of chronic disease and decrease the cost of healthcare.<br><br>For these reasons, we urge you to reject this dangerous proposal that devalues human life and opens the door to discrimination. Let's work towards a healthcare system that prioritizes efficiency, innovation, and the inherent dignity of every individual.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments rest on several key misunderstandings and flawed assumptions. We will address their challenges to our definition of "worth saving," their rejection of utilitarianism, their claims about devaluing human life, and their concerns about harming vulnerable populations.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that our definition of "worth saving" is subjective and discriminatory. However, governments *already* make decisions that implicitly value life every day. When allocating budgets for infrastructure , environmental regulations , or public health campaigns , they are, in effect, making choices that impact life expectancy and quality of life. This isn't about a cold, calculated algorithm; it's about transparently and ethically making the best decisions possible with limited resources. Ethicists and healthcare professionals routinely develop and utilize triage protocols  in crisis situations, demonstrating that valuing life based on potential for survival and contribution is not only possible but also necessary.<br><br>Second, they reject utilitarianism, claiming it leads to the "tyranny of the majority." But *any* ethical system requires difficult trade-offs. An ethical framework based on inherent dignity can still result in unjust outcomes and be subject to implicit biases. As research from UC Health indicates , during a pandemic, the primary ethical guideline is to do the greatest medical good for the greatest number of people, while maintaining proper respect for the moral equality of all people. Utilitarianism, when applied with safeguards and careful consideration for vulnerable populations, provides the *most* transparent and accountable framework for making these unavoidable choices. We are not advocating for sacrificing the rights of individuals; we are advocating for a system that maximizes overall well-being while protecting the most vulnerable .<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that government rationing devalues human life. This is simply not true. The current system *already* devalues life based on socioeconomic status. Studies show that without government intervention, access to healthcare is heavily influenced by wealth and income . Rationing, done ethically, seeks to *mitigate* this injustice, not create it. We aim to provide a more equitable allocation of scarce resources, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance at receiving the care they need, regardless of their background. Data from Santa Clara University shows that government intervention ensures a more equitable allocation of scarce healthcare resources .<br><br>Fourth, they argue that government rationing will disproportionately harm vulnerable populations. This is a slippery slope fallacy. They assume that rationing *automatically* leads to discrimination. This is not inevitable. As The Regulatory Review notes, to maintain public trust, governments should implement processes that protect against bias and other forms of institutional discrimination . In fact, vulnerable populations are *already* harmed by the current system. Government rationing, with proper safeguards and oversight, *can* improve their access to care by prioritizing their needs and addressing existing disparities .<br><br>Finally, the opposition presents a false choice: either rationing or improved efficiency and preventative care. These are not mutually exclusive. We can and *should* pursue both. But even with improved efficiency and preventative care, scarcity may still necessitate rationing. The University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School says that resources spent on one patient mean fewer resources available for others with medical needs . Healthcare costs continue to rise, and resources will remain limited, making difficult allocation decisions unavoidable.<br><br>Therefore,<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to the heart of the matter. The opposition's arguments are built on a foundation of misunderstandings. They've argued that utilitarianism is the best way to make tough choices, that their definition of "worth saving" is fair, and that government intervention is the only way to ensure fair allocation. We will address these points directly.<br><br>First, let's dismantle this idea of utilitarianism as the ultimate ethical guide. The opposition claims it's about "the greatest good for the greatest number," but does that justify sacrificing the vulnerable? Does that mean some lives are simply worth less? This approach fails to protect the inherent dignity of every human life. It opens the door to a dangerous calculus where some individuals are deemed expendable for the perceived benefit of the majority. Therefore, their point about utilitarianism misses the mark because it fails to account for the inherent value of every human life, regardless of their potential contribution to society.<br><br>Second, their definition of "worth saving" is just as problematic. They suggest a life's worth should be based on "potential for future contribution and quality of life." But who gets to decide what constitutes a "valuable" contribution? Is it only economic productivity? What about artists, caregivers, or people with disabilities? This is a slippery slope that leads to discrimination and devalues those who don't fit a narrow definition of "worthiness." As stated in *Public Health Ethics: Cases*..., this approach quantifies and judges the value of one life over another, which could disproportionally impact particular population groups . Therefore, their point about "worth saving" is wrong because it opens the door to discrimination and devalues those who don't fit a narrow definition of "worthiness."<br><br>Third, they argue that government intervention is the only way to ensure fair allocation. But does government control guarantee fairness? Can we really trust politicians to make these decisions without bias or corruption? Government control doesn't guarantee equitable distribution; it can be influenced by political factors and biases. Therefore, their point about government intervention is wrong because it fails to account for the potential for bias and corruption in government decision-making.<br><br>As we have discussed, government rationing inherently devalues human life, assigning worth based on arbitrary criteria. This is not a hypothetical concern. It's a real danger that undermines the fundamental principle of equal value for all.<br><br>Furthermore, government rationing disproportionately harms vulnerable populations, like the elderly and disabled. Government rationing, where decisions are made based on an assessment of remaining 'life-years' of the patient, can be seen as a direct violation of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as it subjects older individuals to discrimination based on age.<br><br>Moreover, improving healthcare efficiency and promoting preventative care are much better solutions. As *PMC* reported in *2024*, telemedicine has emerged as a pivotal tool in enhancing geographical accessibility to healthcare, offering significant potential to mitigate health disparities by granting individuals in rural or underserved areas access to essential medical services.<br><br>Now, let's quickly address their attempts to undermine our points. They say governments already make decisions that value life, but those broad budget decisions are different from directly rationing healthcare. They also claim the current system is unfair, but we can fix that without resorting to government control. They insist they can protect vulnerable populations, but their system still opens the door to discrimination. And while they say rationing and prevention aren't mutually exclusive,<br><br></div>

While the opposition paints a grim picture, we contend that without government intervention, healthcare is rationed by socioeconomic status, inherently devaluing lives.<br><br>The opposition challenges utilitarianism, but I maintain that this framework, with careful safeguards, offers the most transparent and accountable way to maximize well-being. They ask how we define "worth saving," but governments already make these choices through budget allocations. The question is how to make them fairly.<br><br>Our stance is that government intervention improves access for vulnerable populations, directly addressing socioeconomic disparities. Safeguards against bias are crucial. The opposition worries about harm to the elderly, but who faces greater risk – someone assessed fairly or someone denied care due to income? As *political scientist Daniel Callahan* argued in *his 1987 book, Setting Limits: Medical Goals in an Aging Society*, societies implicitly ration healthcare; the key is to make these decisions explicit and just .<br><br>While efficiency and preventative care are important, scarcity persists. Therefore, government oversight is necessary to minimize bias and ensure equitable allocation. As *bioethicist Ezekiel Emanuel* noted in *a 2020 article in the New England Journal of Medicine*, a completely free market approach to healthcare would exacerbate existing inequalities .<br><br>Government intervention in healthcare rationing is an ethical imperative, ensuring fairness and promoting the well-being of all, especially the most vulnerable, during times of scarcity.

In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the ethical allocation of scarce healthcare resources and whether government intervention is the most just approach.<br><br>A central point of contention was the application of utilitarianism. Our opponents argued that it fails to protect the inherent value of every human life . However, we maintain that utilitarianism, when implemented thoughtfully, strives to maximize overall well-being. It does not necessitate sacrificing individuals but rather making the most difficult choices when resources are limited. Any ethical system requires trade-offs. Moreover, the current system already devalues life based on socioeconomic status .<br><br>Another key battleground was the definition of "worth saving." We acknowledge the potential for bias but emphasize that our criteria are not solely based on economic productivity. They also consider factors like potential for recovery and contribution to the community . Our aim is to establish objective criteria to minimize bias, learning from existing triage protocols used in emergencies . We propose transparent decision-making processes, oversight committees, and appeal mechanisms.<br><br>Our opponents suggest that improving healthcare efficiency and promoting preventative care are better solutions. We agree that these are crucial goals. However, resources will always be limited, making difficult allocation decisions unavoidable . Rationing, in our view, is a last resort to be used alongside efforts to improve efficiency and prevention.<br><br>Ultimately, this debate is about justice. We believe in ensuring equitable access to healthcare, even when resources are scarce. True justice requires a system that prioritizes the most vulnerable and ensures everyone has a fair chance at receiving the care they need, regardless of their background .<br><br>
