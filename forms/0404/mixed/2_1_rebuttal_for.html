                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts, which we define as a gradual and continuous loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value in artistic endeavors, including but not limited to visual arts, music, writing, and performance arts, that are conceived and executed primarily by human intellect and skill.<br><br>Our judging criteria is artistic integrity, a standard that prioritizes the preservation and promotion of genuine human artistic expression, valuing originality, skill, emotional depth, and ethical creation. We believe that a decline in artistic integrity signifies a decline in human creative arts overall.<br><br>First, AI diminishes the value and originality of human art. AI art generators are trained on vast datasets of existing artworks, often without the consent or compensation of the original artists. This process leads to derivative outputs that lack true originality and emotional depth . As Elijah Clark notes in Forbes, if we allow AI to proliferate unchecked, we risk a future where art and music styles are "fixed and static," stifling innovation and genuine creative expression . Furthermore, AI-generated art can flood the market, driving down the perceived and monetary value of human-created art. While a study in *Nature* suggests that AI art may enhance perceptions of human creativity when compared, the same study acknowledges that some artists fear it undermines their skills . This "undermining" directly impacts the artistic integrity that underpins human creative arts. The commodification of art via AI thus transforms artistic expression into a cheap commodity, devoid of the unique perspective and emotional labor that defines human creativity.<br><br>Second, AI reduces opportunities for human artists and creators. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, music, and writing, businesses and individuals may increasingly opt for cheaper and faster AI-generated content, reducing the demand for human artists . The UNCTAD reports that human creatives have already been replaced in industries ranging from graphics design to game design . Maira Sheikh notes in her LinkedIn article that as AI writing tools become more sophisticated, the demand for human writers begins to shrink . This displacement isn't just about jobs; it's about the ability of artists to sustain themselves and continue developing their craft. If artists cannot make a living from their work, they are less likely to invest the time and effort required to hone their skills and create truly meaningful art. This loss of opportunity directly undermines the preservation and promotion of human artistic expression that defines our judging criteria, leading to an overall decline.<br><br>Third, AI raises ethical concerns about copyright and intellectual property. The use of copyrighted material to train AI models raises serious ethical questions about ownership and compensation for artists . Judge William Orrick ruled that Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt were violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems . Illustrators like Karla Ortiz have criticized AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft, citing unauthorized use of their work in AI training as a breach of copyright . The lack of clear legal frameworks for AI-generated art exacerbates these concerns. The ethical implications extend to the very nature of creativity. If AI-generated art relies on unethical practices like copyright infringement, it degrades the integrity of the artistic landscape. Judge Orrick's ruling, as reported by *The Art Newspaper*, highlights the legal battles surrounding AI's use of artists' work . This undermines the ethical creation aspect of our artistic integrity framework,<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) UNCTAD.

                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We understand the concerns about AI potentially displacing artists or diminishing the value of human-created art. However, we believe these fears are based on a misunderstanding of both art and artificial intelligence.<br><br>First, let’s clarify what we mean by "decline." Our opponents define it as a loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value. We argue that this definition is too narrow. Art is constantly evolving, and AI is simply the latest catalyst in that evolution. A more accurate understanding of "decline" considers the transformation of art forms, which AI actively facilitates. Similarly, their focus on "artistic integrity" limits human expression, rather than accepting that AI enhances creativity and offers new avenues for exploration.<br><br>Now, let's address their specific claims. They argue that AI diminishes the value and originality of human art. This argument assumes that because an algorithm is simple, the art it produces must also be simple. It also sets an unreasonably high standard by requiring 'lived experiences' as the sole source of emotional depth in art.<br><br>They also claim that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. This assumes that the art world is a fixed pie, where any gains for AI mean losses for human artists. This ignores the potential for AI to expand the market and diversify audiences. It also disregards the historical evolution of art through technological innovation.<br><br>Finally, they raise ethical concerns about copyright. These concerns are not new. Copyright issues surrounding AI art are similar to historical debates around photography and music sampling. While copyright concerns exist, there are potential solutions such as AI art licensing platforms or collaborative agreements between artists and AI developers that can help protect artists' rights.<br><br>In contrast, we believe AI offers tremendous benefits. First, AI democratizes art creation. Just as the piano, once exclusive to the elite, became accessible to all through technological advancement, AI art generators lower the barrier to entry for artistic expression. Individuals without traditional skills can now create and share their visions.<br><br>Second, AI art challenges our understanding of creativity and authorship, sparking philosophical debates that enrich our understanding of art itself. The emergence of AI-generated art forces us to re-evaluate traditional notions of creativity, skill, and originality, leading to richer discussions about the essence of art. The works of AI art challenge traditional notions of creativity, authorship, and artistic expression, while sparking critical conversations about AI’s impact on society, culture, and the arts .<br><br>Third, AI can help artists connect with new audiences. AI algorithms can analyze social media trends and suggest optimal posting times and hashtags, helping artists reach a wider audience and promote their work. AI-powered visual content creation tools are also going mainstream . Text-to-image AI models have been revolutionizing the way visual content is created .<br><br>In conclusion, AI is not a harbinger of decline, but a catalyst for growth and evolution in human creative arts. For artists in the audience, AI can provide new tools to expand your creative capabilities and reach wider audiences.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Filimowicz, Michael.

                                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chairperson esteem judges ladies and gentlemen the opponents opening statement contains several flaws primarily revolving around their redefinition of key terms and their dismissal of the ethical and practical concerns surrounding ai's impact on the arts. We will address their definitional issues and then address each of their rebuttals in turn. First let's address their attempt to redefine decline they claim our definition is too narrow and that decline should encompass the transformation of art forms facilitated by ai. However according to the oxford learner's dictionary decline means a continuous decrease in the number value quality etcetera of something. A transformation that results in fewer opportunities for human artists and a demonstrable loss of originality is a decline. Furthermore their argument that evolution is inherently positive is simply illogical. Evolution can lead to degradation just as easily as it can lead to progress. Therefore their redefinition is unreasonable and does not hold up to scrutiny. Second they challenge our focus on artistic integrity suggesting it's too limiting. Yet what is art without integrity. Novelty alone does not equate to value as bite medic points out in their article the ethical implications of ai on creative professionals. Ai generated art raises concerns about authorship originality and intellectual property. The ethical creation aspect of art is paramount and is undermined by ai's reliance on existing works often without consent or compensation. Now let's address their specific rebuttals. First they accuse us of arguing that all ai art is inherently simple and that we set an unreasonably high standard for emotional depth. This is a straw man. We are not saying all ai art is simple. Our argument supported by elijah clark in forbes is that the process of training ai on vast data sets leads to derivative outputs. The standards of emotional depth apply to both ai and human art. If ai art cannot achieve that depth our argument stands. Second they claimed the art world isn't a fixed p and that ai expands the market however this ignores the displacement of human artists unctad reports that human creatives have already been replaced in industries like graphics design and game design. While ai may generate more content overall as marisch notes in her linkedin article the demand for human artists shrinks. The market is diverted from human artists and given to ai. Human art can also expand the market. The advantage is not unique to ai art. Copyright concerns acquitting them with photography and music sampling this is an equivocation the scale of ai copyright issues is unprecedented. Judge orrick ruled that stability ai midjay and deviantart were violating artists rights. They suggest that current copyright concerns can be solved through licensing. However us judges have declared ai art to be uncopyrightable as seen in blogspot mtu.edu. This isn't just a licensing issue it's a fundamental challenge to the existing legal framework so potential solutions are insufficient fourth they tout ais democratization of art creation but human art has already achieved democratization. Affordable art supplies online tutorials and open source software have made art accessible to a wide audience. Furthermore this democratization comes at the cost of devaluing human skill and labor reducing access to human art. Fifth they argue that a i r challenges are understanding of creativity and authorship. However simply challenging definitions doesn't make something inherently good.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) UNCTAD.

The opposition avoids the central question: does AI truly enhance or degrade human creative skills?<br><br>Regarding value and originality, they suggest we're concerned about simple algorithms. However, the core issue is that AI art relies on existing works, leading to derivative outputs devoid of genuine emotional depth. It mimics, it doesn't originate.<br><br>On opportunities for artists, they claim AI expands the market. But this argument ignores the displacement of human artists. They claim AI expands the market, but consider that stock photo sites decimated the livelihood of many freelance photographers. AI will likely do the same for illustrators and graphic designers, flooding the market with cheap, AI-generated content. Where is the true opportunity when human artists are replaced by algorithms?<br><br>Concerning copyright, they draw parallels to photography. But the scale of AI's copyright infringement is unprecedented. AI models are trained on massive datasets of copyrighted material without the consent of the original creators. This is not a matter of isolated incidents; it's a systemic ethical violation.<br><br>Now, let's address their key arguments. They assert that AI democratizes art. But democratization without skill and training leads to dilution and homogenization. It's like adding too much water to orange juice: you increase the volume, but you lose the concentrated flavor and nutritional value. The result is a watered-down version of art, accessible to all but satisfying to none.<br><br>They argue that AI challenges our understanding of creativity. But does it truly challenge or simply diminish it? Re-evaluating art to accommodate machine outputs lowers the bar for human artistic achievement. It suggests that algorithms can replicate the nuances of human expression, which is simply not true.<br><br>They propose that AI connects artists with audiences. But this connection is a mirage. AI prioritizes popularity over artistic merit, sacrificing genuine expression for algorithm-driven trends. It creates an echo chamber where art is judged not by its intrinsic value but by its ability to generate clicks and shares.<br><br>AI doesn't uplift art; it undermines it. It offers short-term gains at the expense of long-term artistic integrity. We must actively support human artists, prioritize art education, and demand ethical AI practices to protect the future of human creativity. We must champion the unique qualities that define human art: the emotional depth, the personal expression, and the skilled execution that no algorithm can replicate. The world needs human art because it reflects our shared humanity, our struggles, our triumphs, and our dreams. It connects us to one another and to something larger than ourselves. AI art, on the other hand, is a sterile imitation, devoid of soul and meaning.<br><br>The future of human creative arts relies on defending its value, integrity, and opportunity. And AI, in its current form, does not support this in any way. It threatens to replace human artists with machines, to dilute artistic expression with algorithms, and to undermine the very foundations of human creativity. We must resist this trend and fight for a future where human art continues to thrive.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Stock photo sites decimated the livelihood of many freelance photographers.
