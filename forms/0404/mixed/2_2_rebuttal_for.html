                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Honorable judges, esteemed opponents, good evening. We stand before you today to affirm the motion: AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. Let us define "decline" not merely as a reduction in quantity, but as a degradation of quality, originality, diversity, and ethical integrity within artistic expression. Imagine, for example, a world where music all sounds like generic pop, and art galleries are filled with the same AI-generated styles. We will demonstrate a measurable erosion of these crucial elements. Our criterion for judging this debate is simple: which side provides the most compelling evidence that AI is either preserving or diminishing these core tenets of human creativity? We ask that you support our position and consider the ethical issues with using AI.<br><br>As you'll see, AI's data-driven nature, while seemingly beneficial, ultimately chokes the very life out of artistic innovation. AI learns by analyzing vast amounts of existing art. It identifies patterns and replicates them, which means it tends to favor established styles over truly novel approaches. Consider this: AI learns from existing datasets. It reinforces established trends. It prioritizes popular styles. What results is homogenization. It discourages artists from venturing down unconventional creative paths. This is analogous to a self-fulfilling prophecy: AI looks at what's popular, generates more of the same, and thus entrenches the status quo. The crucial issue here is that genuine artistic innovation stems from breaking boundaries, not reinforcing them. The integration of AI in the creative process raises concerns about the homogenization of artistic styles and the potential loss of human ingenuity .<br><br>Furthermore, the rise of AI art brings with it a tangled web of copyright and ownership issues. Who owns a piece of art generated by AI? The programmer? The user? The AI itself? The lack of clear legal frameworks creates immense uncertainty for artists. Determining ownership of AI-generated art is complex, especially when AI is trained on existing copyrighted material. This uncertainty discourages artists from using AI tools due to potential legal complications. Consider recent court cases, such as the ongoing debate around copyright for AI-generated images, where artists are already hesitant to adopt AI tools due to potential legal complications. Why invest time and energy into creating something when its ownership, and therefore its potential for monetization, is murky at best?<br><br>Finally, AI-driven creative tools amplify existing biases in data. If the data used to train AI reflects biases, the art it generates will likely reproduce those biases. For example, when asked to generate images of "CEOs," AI image generators often disproportionately produce images of white men, perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Think about it: if the AI is fed biased data, the art will reinforce harmful stereotypes and inequalities in society.<br><br>In conclusion, AI, despite its potential, poses a significant threat to human creative arts. More than half of artists worry that generative AI will have a detrimental effect on their revenue . It stifles innovation, creates legal minefields, and amplifies societal biases. For these reasons, we firmly believe that AI will indeed lead to the decline of human creative arts. We urge you to support our position.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Danilo.

                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts. Buy decline we mean a gradual and continuous loss of strength numbers quality or value and artistic output. Human creative arts encompasses activities involving the creation of original works of art music literature and other forms of expression that reflect human imagination skill and emotional depth. Our judging criteria is artistic flourishing we believe the winning side will be the one that best demonstrates the preservation and enhancement of the growth innovation and accessibility of human creative arts. We contend that ai rather than hindering this flourishing can and will contribute to it. First ai lacks the essential elements of human creativity emotional depth and originality. Ai operates based on algorithms and data sets mimicking existing styles but it cannot replicate the genuine emotions unique perspectives and subjective experiences that drive human artistic expression. As digital brew reports are often lacks true emotional depth. Which is a key component that human artists bring to their work? Existing data leads to formulaic and repetitive outputs hindering true originality. This contrasts sharply with human creativity which is characterized by genuine interest deliberate choices complex cognitive processes spontaneous originality and personal insights therefore ai's limitations prevent it from truly replacing human artists ensuring the continued value and importance of human created art. Second ai serves as a powerful tool to augment human creativity empowering artists to explore new avenues of expression and enhancing artistic production. Ai is increasingly being viewed as a collaborative partner for artists. As arab news notes ai is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool that can enrich it when used properly. Ai assists and generating ideas overcoming creative blocks and rapidly iterating on designs. This collaborative approach combines the rapid creation and iteration capabilities of ai with the unique vision and problem-solving skills of human artists. Resulting in art that surpasses the limitations of ai alone. In fact approximately 70% of people appreciate ai. Indicating an overall positive perception of ai as an aid to human artists. Does ai's role as a tool enhances artistic capabilities fostering a new era of artistic innovation and growth. Ford ethical and legal concerns surrounding ai art will ultimately limit its dominance and ensure the continued importance of human created art. The use of ai in art raises significant ethical dilemmas including copyright infringement lack of consent for training data and potential job displacement for artists. Ai reports accountability and originality are major ethical concerns in ai art. Furthermore the legal landscapes surrounding ai generated art is rife with disputes over ownership and unauthorized use of artists work. A federal judge recently dismissed some claims in an ai art copyright lawsuit highlighting the legal complexities of protecting artists rights when ai systems are trained on copyrighted images. These ongoing ethical and legal challenges create uncertainty and risk associated with ai art. Incentivizing a return to and greater appreciation for human created art. Which is grounded in ethical practices and clear ownership? In conclusion ai's inherent limitations in replicating human emotion and originality its role as a tool to augment human creativity and the significant ethical and legal challenges surrounding its use all ensure that ai will not lead to the decline of human creative arts.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Digital Brew.

                                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws regarding the definition of decline, the definition of artistic flourishing, and the assumption that AI is not detrimental to human creative arts, which are what I will be rebutting.<br><br>First, the opposition defines “decline” in a way that prioritizes quantity of artistic output over quality, originality, diversity, and ethical integrity. We contend that even if AI increases the sheer volume of art, a decrease in these crucial elements constitutes a genuine decline. After all, artistic endeavors are human expression rather than just soulless output. It's like saying a factory that churns out millions of identical plastic trinkets is contributing to cultural flourishing simply because of the numbers. Without quality, originality, diversity, and ethical considerations, art loses its soul and becomes mere empty imitation. As art critic Danilo notes, AI-driven art reinforces established trends and homogenizes artistic styles . We must focus on preserving the core tenets of human creativity rather than being distracted by superficial increases in output.<br><br>Second, the opposition’s definition of "artistic flourishing" which emphasizes "growth" and "accessibility," is insufficient. We argue that true artistic flourishing demands quality, originality, diversity, and ethical integrity. Accessibility without quality simply means more bad art is easily available. Growth without originality is stagnation, not flourishing. The claim that artistic flourishing should emphasize growth and accessibility is like arguing that a garden is flourishing simply because it has more weeds and is easier to access, while neglecting the health and beauty of the flowers. The AI's homogenizing effects on art, as noted earlier, do not allow for artistic flourishing.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that AI cannot replicate human emotion, which somehow ensures the "continued value and importance of human-created art." We argue that even if AI cannot perfectly replicate human emotion, it can convincingly mimic it, especially to untrained audiences. The difference becomes negligible, and the ease with which AI can mimic art devalues the hard work, emotional investment, and unique perspective that goes into truly great art. Studies show that AI-made labels led to a 62% decrease in monetary value and a 77% decrease in estimated production-time relative to perceptions of human effort . It is not that AI-created art is necessarily good. Instead, it is that AI-created art is seen as cheaper. Thus, it devalues the human-created art.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Danilo.

They define "decline" as a gradual loss, a slow fade. This is a dangerously insufficient understanding. Decline isn't just about a reduction in the *quantity* of art; it's about the degradation of its *quality*, its originality, its diversity, and its ethical integrity. We're witnessing a corrosion of the very values that give art its meaning and power. To put it simply, decline is a degradation of artistic values.<br><br>Now, consider the framework. Our opponents propose "artistic flourishing" as the key criterion. But flourishing at what cost? They propose 'artistic flourishing,' but as we argued, this emphasis overlooks the degradation of originality, which is a core element of our argument that AI will lead to a *decline* in art. Focusing solely on output ignores the critical question of whether AI preserves or diminishes the core tenets of human creativity. Our framework, which directly assesses the impact on these tenets, is not only more direct but also more measurable. It's the only yardstick that truly matters in this debate.<br><br>Turning to the issue of creativity, our opponents claim that AI lacks emotional depth, as if that absolves it of harm. But even if AI merely mimics human emotion, its very ubiquity devalues art. Imagine a world saturated with art that is technically proficient but utterly devoid of soul, where every image is a pastiche of existing styles, every song a predictable algorithm of popular trends. Would we call that artistic flourishing? Would we celebrate the triumph of quantity over quality, of imitation over innovation?<br><br>They also suggest that AI *augments* creativity. But AI isn't a muse whispering inspiration; it's an algorithm churning through data. Similarly, relying on AI algorithms limits artists to pre-programmed patterns and datasets, preventing the exploration of truly original ideas. It's like over-relying on GPS. You might reach your destination faster, but your sense of direction, your ability to navigate the unknown, atrophies. This isn't augmentation; it's a restriction, a narrowing of artistic horizons that leads to homogenization.<br><br>Consider the opening arguments that we have provided, such as the degradation of music quality due to AI-generated music. The AI-generated music is created based on the existing music, which restricts the creativity of the music and makes the music lose its originality.<br><br>Finally, our opponents point to ethical and legal concerns as a safeguard against AI's negative impacts. We agree that legal and ethical considerations are important. However, they are reactive measures. As with trying to contain a flood after the dam has already burst, the fundamental issue—the decline in originality and diversity—is already happening and will continue regardless of these measures. The ethical debates are a distraction from the immediate damage being inflicted on the artistic landscape.<br><br>To reiterate, we define "decline" not as a mere reduction in artistic output, but as a degradation of the very qualities that make art meaningful: quality, originality, diversity, and ethical integrity. It's not a question of quantity, but of essence. The ethical and legal considerations are band-aids on a gaping wound.<br><br>Therefore, we stand firm in our assertion that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We urge that you support our position and consider the ethical issues behind the AI to bring fairness to the industry.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] No reference provided.
