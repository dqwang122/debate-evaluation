                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts, which we define as a gradual and continuous loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value in artistic endeavors, including but not limited to visual arts, music, writing, and performance arts, that are conceived and executed primarily by human intellect and skill.<br><br>Our judging criteria is artistic integrity, a standard that prioritizes the preservation and promotion of genuine human artistic expression, valuing originality, skill, emotional depth, and ethical creation. We believe that a decline in artistic integrity signifies a decline in human creative arts overall.<br><br>First, AI diminishes the value and originality of human art. AI art generators are trained on vast datasets of existing artworks, often without the consent or compensation of the original artists. This process leads to derivative outputs that lack true originality and emotional depth . As Elijah Clark notes in Forbes, if we allow AI to proliferate unchecked, we risk a future where art and music styles are "fixed and static," stifling innovation and genuine creative expression . Furthermore, AI-generated art can flood the market, driving down the perceived and monetary value of human-created art. While a study in *Nature* suggests that AI art may enhance perceptions of human creativity when compared, the same study acknowledges that some artists fear it undermines their skills . This "undermining" directly impacts the artistic integrity that underpins human creative arts. The commodification of art via AI thus transforms artistic expression into a cheap commodity, devoid of the unique perspective and emotional labor that defines human creativity.<br><br>Second, AI reduces opportunities for human artists and creators. As AI becomes more capable of producing art, music, and writing, businesses and individuals may increasingly opt for cheaper and faster AI-generated content, reducing the demand for human artists . The UNCTAD reports that human creatives have already been replaced in industries ranging from graphics design to game design . Maira Sheikh notes in her LinkedIn article that as AI writing tools become more sophisticated, the demand for human writers begins to shrink . This displacement isn't just about jobs; it's about the ability of artists to sustain themselves and continue developing their craft. If artists cannot make a living from their work, they are less likely to invest the time and effort required to hone their skills and create truly meaningful art. This loss of opportunity directly undermines the preservation and promotion of human artistic expression that defines our judging criteria, leading to an overall decline.<br><br>Third, AI raises ethical concerns about copyright and intellectual property. The use of copyrighted material to train AI models raises serious ethical questions about ownership and compensation for artists . Judge William Orrick ruled that Stability AI, Midjourney, and DeviantArt were violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems . Illustrators like Karla Ortiz have criticized AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft, citing unauthorized use of their work in AI training as a breach of copyright . The lack of clear legal frameworks for AI-generated art exacerbates these concerns. The ethical implications extend to the very nature of creativity. If AI-generated art relies on unethical practices like copyright infringement, it degrades the integrity of the artistic landscape. Judge Orrick's ruling, as reported by *The Art Newspaper*, highlights the legal battles surrounding AI's use of artists' work . This undermines the ethical creation aspect of our artistic integrity framework,<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) UNCTAD.

                                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that AI will *not* lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define "decline" as a gradual and continuous loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value in the production, appreciation, innovation, and cultural significance of human-created art forms. We define "human creative arts" as artistic endeavors that originate from human ingenuity, skill, and emotional expression, encompassing visual arts, music, literature, performance arts, and crafts. We define "AI" as computer systems able to perform tasks that ordinarily require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages; in creative arts, AI refers to algorithms and programs capable of generating art autonomously or assisting human artists.<br><br>Our judging criteria is the preservation of human agency in creative expression. You, as the judge, should prioritize arguments that demonstrate the enduring importance of human intellect, emotion, and intention in the creation and appreciation of art. Arguments demonstrating AI's limitations and the unique value of human contribution should be valued higher than arguments solely focused on technological advancement. This standard is appropriate because it centers the debate on the core question of human creativity's fate in the age of AI, rather than simply evaluating AI's capabilities.<br><br>First, AI lacks the essential qualities of human creativity. AI-generated art lacks the emotional depth, subjective experiences, and intentionality that are fundamental to human artistic expression. Digital Brew  notes that AI art struggles with true emotional depth and the ability to make intuitive decisions. Human art often reflects the human experience and emotions, aspects that AI cannot replicate . While AI can mimic creativity, it cannot replace the genuine emotions and unique perspectives that humans bring to their work . This is because AI creativity relies on data and algorithms, lacking true originality and self-expression . The irreplaceable element of human creativity ensures that while AI can generate art, it cannot cause a decline in the unique value and appreciation of human artistic endeavors.<br><br>Second, AI serves as a tool to enhance, not replace, human creativity. AI should be viewed as a tool that assists human artists, enabling them to explore new creative avenues and overcome limitations, rather than as a replacement for human artistic endeavor. Al-Ghamdi  states that AI is not a substitute for human creativity but a tool that can enrich it if used properly. In fact, most people view AI as an aid to human artists rather than a replacement . AI can assist in generating ideas and overcoming creative blocks . By combining the rapid iteration and image creation strengths of AI with the vision and problem-solving skills of human artists, AI can expand human capabilities and achieve better results . Therefore, rather than leading to a decline, AI serves to augment human creativity, leading to new forms of artistic expression and innovation.<br><br>Third, ethical and legal concerns impede AI's dominance in the arts. Ethical considerations, such as copyright infringement, lack of consent in training data, and potential job displacement for artists, along with legal ambiguities surrounding AI-generated art, hinder its widespread adoption and prevent the decline of human-led creative arts. Ethical concerns in AI art include copyright issues, lack of consent for training data, and potential job displacement for artists . Copyright law struggles to adapt to AI-generated art, leading to legal uncertainty and disputes over ownership and infringement <br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Digital Brew.

                                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the claim that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We understand the concerns about AI potentially displacing artists or diminishing the value of human-created art. However, we believe these fears are based on a misunderstanding of both art and artificial intelligence.<br><br>First, let’s clarify what we mean by "decline." Our opponents define it as a loss of strength, numbers, quality, or value. We argue that this definition is too narrow. Art is constantly evolving, and AI is simply the latest catalyst in that evolution. A more accurate understanding of "decline" considers the transformation of art forms, which AI actively facilitates. Similarly, their focus on "artistic integrity" limits human expression, rather than accepting that AI enhances creativity and offers new avenues for exploration.<br><br>Now, let's address their specific claims. They argue that AI diminishes the value and originality of human art. This argument assumes that because an algorithm is simple, the art it produces must also be simple. It also sets an unreasonably high standard by requiring 'lived experiences' as the sole source of emotional depth in art.<br><br>They also claim that AI reduces opportunities for human artists. This assumes that the art world is a fixed pie, where any gains for AI mean losses for human artists. This ignores the potential for AI to expand the market and diversify audiences. It also disregards the historical evolution of art through technological innovation.<br><br>Finally, they raise ethical concerns about copyright. These concerns are not new. Copyright issues surrounding AI art are similar to historical debates around photography and music sampling. While copyright concerns exist, there are potential solutions such as AI art licensing platforms or collaborative agreements between artists and AI developers that can help protect artists' rights.<br><br>In contrast, we believe AI offers tremendous benefits. First, AI democratizes art creation. Just as the piano, once exclusive to the elite, became accessible to all through technological advancement, AI art generators lower the barrier to entry for artistic expression. Individuals without traditional skills can now create and share their visions.<br><br>Second, AI art challenges our understanding of creativity and authorship, sparking philosophical debates that enrich our understanding of art itself. The emergence of AI-generated art forces us to re-evaluate traditional notions of creativity, skill, and originality, leading to richer discussions about the essence of art. The works of AI art challenge traditional notions of creativity, authorship, and artistic expression, while sparking critical conversations about AI’s impact on society, culture, and the arts .<br><br>Third, AI can help artists connect with new audiences. AI algorithms can analyze social media trends and suggest optimal posting times and hashtags, helping artists reach a wider audience and promote their work. AI-powered visual content creation tools are also going mainstream . Text-to-image AI models have been revolutionizing the way visual content is created .<br><br>In conclusion, AI is not a harbinger of decline, but a catalyst for growth and evolution in human creative arts. For artists in the audience, AI can provide new tools to expand your creative capabilities and reach wider audiences.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Filimowicz, Michael.
