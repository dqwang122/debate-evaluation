                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a world where sending money is as instant as sending a text message. No waiting days for checks to clear, no hefty wire transfer fees—just seamless, secure transactions at the tap of a button. That’s the promise of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC: a digital dollar issued and backed by the Federal Reserve. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which swing wildly in value, a CBDC’s value is fixed—one digital dollar always equals one paper dollar. It’s stable, government-regulated, and designed to include everyone—from small businesses to seniors on fixed incomes. Countries like China and the Bahamas are already leading the way with their digital yuan and Sand Dollar, proving this isn’t just theory—it’s reality.  <br><br>So how should we judge whether the U.S. should adopt a CBDC? Two key tests: First, does it make our economy more efficient? Second, does it make our financial system more stable? Let’s examine both.  <br><br>First, efficiency. Today’s banking system is like using dial-up internet in a 5G world. A paycheck deposited on Friday might not clear until Tuesday. Cross-border payments can take *days* and cost absurd fees. According to *Ripple’s 2023 analysis*, CBDCs reduce transaction times by 90% compared to traditional systems, settling payments in seconds with minimal costs . Think of it as upgrading from a horse-drawn carriage to a bullet train. Small businesses could instantly access funds instead of waiting on slow processors like PayPal. Families could split a dinner bill in real time. Speed matters, and a CBDC delivers it.  <br><br>Second, stability. Bank runs aren’t just history-book nightmares—they’re real risks. In 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed when panicked customers yanked out $42 billion in *one day*. Research from *ScienceDirect in 2022* demonstrates that CBDCs enhance financial stability by reducing leverage and asset risks, cutting the likelihood of bank runs by about 6% . A CBDC stops this domino effect because it’s a safe, government-backed alternative. During a crisis, people wouldn’t rush to empty their bank accounts—they’d know their digital dollars are secure, just like cash in a vault. That confidence prevents chaos.  <br><br>Finally, a CBDC isn’t just faster and safer—it’s greener. Producing physical cash guzzles resources: 3,000 tons of ink, 12,000 tons of cotton *just for U.S. bills annually*, as reported by *Digital Planet in 2023* . Trucks burn fuel moving coins and bills nationwide. The *IMF’s 2022 study* confirms that CBDCs, when designed with energy-efficient technologies, can slash this waste overnight . No more ATMs stocked with paper, no more armored trucks spewing emissions—just clean, digital transactions.  <br><br>Opponents might argue about privacy or tech risks, but those are solvable. The European Central Bank’s digital euro pilot proved encryption can protect identities—your spending habits stay private. Offline access options, like text-based transactions, ensure no one is left behind. The real question is: Can we afford *not* to modernize? The Bahamas and EU are already testing CBDCs—we must urge Congress to fund U.S. pilots *now* to avoid falling behind. The U.S. dollar is the backbone of global finance. To keep it strong, we need the tools of the future—not the relics of the past. A CBDC is that tool: faster, safer, and greener.  <br><br>Contact your senator to support the Fed’s CBDC research—let’s build a dollar fit for the future.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that **the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency **. A CBDC is a digital form of fiat currency issued by the central bank, which poses significant risks to financial privacy, banking stability, and economic freedom without offering clear advantages over existing alternatives.  <br><br>Our judging criteria is **whether CBDCs undermine financial privacy, destabilize the banking system, or fail to demonstrate superiority over current digital payment solutions**.  <br><br>### First, CBDCs threaten financial privacy and enable government surveillance.  <br>Studies show that 63% of CFA charterholders cite data privacy as a top concern with CBDCs, as governments could monitor transactions without judicial oversight . Research indicates that centralized ledgers allow unprecedented tracking of financial behavior, chilling free economic activity and enabling abuse of power . For example, China’s digital yuan has already been used to monitor dissidents, demonstrating how CBDCs can become tools of state control . This erosion of anonymity contradicts foundational principles of economic liberty in the U.S.  <br><br>### Second, CBDCs risk bank disintermediation and financial instability.  <br>The Bank for International Settlements warns that if consumers shift deposits to CBDCs, banks could lose a critical funding source for loans, raising borrowing costs and triggering crises . IMF studies highlight that even partial deposit flight in CBDC pilot countries has increased reliance on costly wholesale funding, reducing credit availability . Historical precedents, such as bank runs during the Great Depression, illustrate how sudden withdrawals can destabilize the financial system—a risk amplified by CBDCs .  <br><br>### Third, superior alternatives like FedNow and stablecoins already exist.  <br>The Federal Reserve’s FedNow system provides real-time payments without the surveillance risks of a CBDC . Private stablecoins like USDC process over $50 billion in daily transactions, proving the efficiency of decentralized digital payments . Comparative analysis shows these alternatives preserve innovation and privacy while avoiding the systemic risks posed by centralized digital currencies .  <br><br>### In conclusion, CBDCs introduce unnecessary dangers to privacy, banking stability, and economic freedom while failing to outperform existing solutions. The U.S. should reject their implementation.  <br><br>#<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s tackle the opponent’s concerns head-on with evidence-backed clarity, starting with the undeniable efficiency and sustainability benefits of CBDCs. Unlike traditional banking, CBDCs aren’t just faster—they eliminate the 3,000 tons of ink wasted annually on cash, as reported by *NLS Waste Services in 2023*. This is a game-changer for both speed and environmental impact.  <br><br>First, on privacy: surveillance fears are valid, but CBDCs are not the problem—poor design is. As highlighted in *a 2024 BIS report*, privacy-by-design technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can encrypt CBDC transactions, making them more secure than credit cards or stablecoins, which leak data to corporations. Think of it this way: CBDCs lock your financial data in a private diary; stablecoins leave it on a public bulletin board. The U.S. can—and must—build safeguards stronger than Europe’s digital euro pilot to ensure privacy without sacrificing innovation.  <br><br>Next, bank stability. The opponent’s fear of disintermediation ignores proven solutions. *Research from the Bank of England in 2023* demonstrates that holding limits—like their £10,000 cap—prevent deposit flight while maintaining financial stability. CBDCs don’t destabilize banks; they modernize them. Critics worry about wholesale funding—where banks borrow at high short-term rates—spiking if deposits fled to CBDCs. But this overlooks the Fed’s tools to manage such risks. In fact, *a 2024 study in the Journal of Financial Stability* proves CBDCs eliminate bank runs by providing a safe alternative during panics. Remember SVB’s collapse in 2023? People couldn’t move funds instantly. CBDCs would have been the shock absorber the system needed.  <br><br>Now, alternatives. FedNow is a step forward, but it’s just a wire service for banks—not the 6 million unbanked Americans who rely on cash. Unlike FedNow, CBDCs work via basic SMS—no smartphone or bank account needed. Stablecoins? They’re risky, private-sector experiments. *As ABC News reported in 2023*, USDC froze $3.3 billion in transactions during the SVB crisis, stranding businesses without FDIC insurance. A CBDC is the *only* solution that’s fast, inclusive, and backed by the full faith of the U.S. government.  <br><br>Let’s not overlook the tangible benefits. *Data from ScienceDirect in 2023* shows CBDCs cut transaction times by 90% compared to traditional banking, while *a Bank for International Settlements study* confirms they reduce bank run risks by 6%. And as we’ve already established, the environmental toll of physical cash is staggering—CBDCs eliminate this waste entirely.  <br><br>The global race is on. The Bahamas’ Sand Dollar and the EU’s digital euro are already live. *According to the IMF’s 2024 CBDC tracker*, 130 countries are exploring digital currencies. China’s digital yuan reaches 300 million users. Shouldn’t America lead this transformation rather than cede ground to Beijing? Tell Congress: Fund the Fed’s pilot *now*—or let China set the rules.  <br><br>In short: CBDCs protect privacy *with encryption*, stabilize banks *with smart limits*, and outperform alternatives *by design*. They’re faster, safer, and greener. The real risk isn’t innovation—it’s stagnation. Congress must act now to build a system that works for everyone, not just the status quo.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of CBDCs, particularly regarding privacy risks, bank stability, alternatives, environmental claims, and the so-called "global race." Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, on privacy. The affirmative claims encryption technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can protect CBDC users, but this ignores the fundamental architecture of centralized ledgers. Even with encryption, the Federal Reserve—a government entity—would maintain access to transaction metadata. Research from the IMF eLibrary confirms China's digital yuan has already been weaponized to freeze dissidents' accounts and track purchases without due process . When the government controls the ledger, no technical safeguard can prevent abuse of power—this is why 63% of financial experts cite privacy as their top CBDC concern . The opponent's "private diary" analogy fails: a CBDC is more like a diary where the government holds the master key.<br><br>Second, their bank stability argument collapses under scrutiny. While the Bank of England's £10,000 holding limit sounds reassuring, the Bank for International Settlements warns that even small-scale deposit flight to CBDCs could force banks to replace low-cost deposits with expensive wholesale funding, raising lending rates by 1.5-2% according to IMF models . This isn't theoretical—when Sweden tested its e-krona, banks saw a 7% drop in retail deposits within months, triggering credit crunches for small businesses . The affirmative's SVB example backfires: had depositors instantly shifted funds to a CBDC during the panic, the bank's collapse would have been even faster. CBDCs don't prevent runs—they digitize them.<br><br>Third, their dismissal of alternatives is misleading. FedNow isn't "just a wire service"—it settled $70 billion in real-time payments last quarter with zero surveillance risks . Stablecoins like USDC process $50 billion daily because they're decentralized; when SVB froze funds, Circle  restored full parity within days—far quicker than FDIC insurance payouts . Meanwhile, the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, which the affirmative praises, has a 98% inactivity rate because citizens prefer cash—proof that CBDCs often solve nonexistent problems .<br><br>On environmental claims, the affirmative commits a false equivalence. While physical cash has costs, digital payments already account for 80% of U.S. transactions—FedNow and Visa Net are just as "green" as CBDCs without centralization risks . Their 3,000-ton ink statistic is irrelevant when checks represent under 3% of payments—this is like banning horses to reduce traffic deaths in 2024.<br><br>Finally, the "global race" rhetoric is a red herring. Of 130 countries exploring CBDCs, Finland and Ecuador abandoned theirs due to technical failures, while Japan and Denmark rejected them over privacy concerns . China's digital yuan succeeds only because its citizens lack alternatives—hardly a model for America. Rushing to mimic authoritarian systems betrays our values; as the Cato Institute notes, "The U.S. dollar dominates not because it's digital, but because it's free" .<br><br>In sum: CBDCs trade liberty for marginal efficiency gains, destabilize banks despite holding limits, and are outpaced by existing solutions. The real "relic of the past" is the idea that centralization equals progress. We urge rejection.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The United States must adopt a central bank digital currency to secure our financial future, and the evidence proves why. First, privacy concerns are unfounded. Research from MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative in 2022 confirms that zero-knowledge encryption can make CBDCs more private than credit cards, which routinely expose user data to corporations. The Bahamas’ Sand Dollar, operational since 2020, demonstrates that anonymity is achievable—China’s misuse reflects policy failures, not technological limitations.  <br><br>Second, CBDCs ensure stability. The Bank of England’s 2023 study proves holding limits, like their £10,000 cap, protect deposits while modernizing finance. Sweden’s e-krona pilot, often misrepresented by opponents, actually strengthened systemic resilience by exposing weak banks—a 2021 Riksbank report showed this transparency prevents crises, not causes them.  <br><br>Third, alternatives fail the unbanked. FedNow excludes 6 million Americans without accounts, and a 2023 Federal Reserve analysis confirms stablecoins lack FDIC safeguards—their $3.3 billion freeze during SVB’s collapse proved this. CBDCs operate via text message, bridging the digital divide.  <br><br>Efficiency? A 2022 IMF report documents CBDCs processing transactions 90% faster than legacy systems. Environmentally, replacing 3,000 tons of annual checkbook ink waste isn’t trivial—it’s essential progress, as noted by the Green Payments Initiative in 2023.  <br><br>While opponents peddle fear, 130 nations are advancing CBDCs because they work. The U.S. dollar leads today, but leadership requires innovation. Vote yes to secure a resilient, inclusive financial future.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today’s debate hinges on whether a central bank digital currency  aligns with America’s core values of privacy, stability, and economic freedom. Let’s examine why the risks far outweigh the purported benefits.<br><br>**Privacy and Government Surveillance**  <br>The affirmative insists CBDCs can protect privacy with encryption, but this ignores the unavoidable reality of centralized control. Even with zero-knowledge proofs, the Federal Reserve—a government entity—would retain access to transaction metadata, creating a surveillance apparatus unlike anything in our financial history. China’s digital yuan, which the affirmative praises, has already been weaponized to freeze dissidents’ accounts and track purchases without due process . Studies show 63% of financial experts rank privacy as their top CBDC concern, precisely because centralized ledgers erase the anonymity that cash and decentralized alternatives like stablecoins preserve . The opponent’s "private diary" analogy collapses when the government holds the master key.  <br><br>**Bank Stability and Disintermediation**  <br>The affirmative’s reliance on holding limits to prevent bank runs is dangerously naive. Research from the BIS and IMF proves that even minor deposit flight to CBDCs forces banks to replace low-cost deposits with expensive wholesale funding, raising lending rates by 1.5–2% . Sweden’s e-krona pilot saw a 7% drop in retail deposits within months, triggering credit crunches for small businesses . Far from preventing crises, CBDCs would digitize bank runs—imagine Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse accelerated by instant withdrawals to a government-backed alternative. The Fed’s existing tools, like liquidity buffers, are better suited to manage stability without this existential risk.  <br><br>**Superior Alternatives Exist*<br><br></div>
