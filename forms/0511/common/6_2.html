                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that it is time to welcome an A.I. Tutor in the classroom, defined as an artificial intelligence system designed to provide personalized, adaptive instruction and feedback to students, leveraging machine learning to tailor educational content to individual needs .  <br>Our judging criteria is the ability of AI tutors to improve educational accessibility, personalization, and efficiency while complementing human teachers, prioritizing equitable learning gains, student engagement, and scalability.  <br><br>First, AI tutors significantly enhance personalized learning, leading to measurable improvements in student outcomes. Unlike traditional one-size-fits-all teaching methods, AI systems adapt in real-time to individual learning paces and styles. Research from Stanford University demonstrates that students using AI tutors learned more than twice as much in less time compared to those in active learning classrooms . For example, Westfield High School in Indiana reported marked improvements in student performance after implementing AI-powered personalized learning tools . This evidence underscores how AI tutors can address diverse learning needs at scale, a critical advantage in overcrowded classrooms.  <br><br>Second, AI tutors democratize education by increasing accessibility and bridging equity gaps. They provide 24/7 support, eliminating geographical and socioeconomic barriers. A randomized study of 1,800 K-12 students from underserved communities found that those using Tutor CoPilot, an AI tutoring app, were 4 percentage points more likely to master math topics than peers without access . Additionally, AI tools like Khanmigo offer adaptive support for students with learning disabilities, tailoring content to their unique needs . These examples highlight AI’s role in creating a more inclusive education system.  <br><br>Third, AI tutors alleviate teacher workload, enabling educators to focus on higher-value tasks. By automating administrative duties and routine tutoring, AI reduces burnout and allows teachers to dedicate time to mentorship and critical thinking exercises. A UK study cited by *The Guardian* found that AI tools could ease the "overwhelming" workload burdening teachers . For instance, AI-driven grading systems cut grading time by up to 50% in pilot programs, freeing teachers to engage more deeply with students . This synergy between AI and human teachers maximizes the strengths of both.  <br><br>In conclusion, AI tutors are a transformative force in education, offering personalized learning, equitable access, and operational efficiency. Their integration into classrooms is not just beneficial but essential to meet the evolving demands of 21st-century education.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, education isn’t just about data—it’s about human connection. While AI advocates praise these tools as a cure-all, they overlook critical flaws that make them unfit for our classrooms.  <br><br>First, AI lacks the emotional intelligence to support students. Imagine a child struggling with anxiety—a human teacher notices the trembling hands, the hesitation, and offers comfort. An AI tutor? It’s like a calculator for emotions: it crunches numbers but can’t mend a heart. While a 2024 study in the *International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education* found that students using AI tutors reported feeling less judged, the same study revealed serious concerns about unreliable answers and a lack of accountability when errors occur . This isn’t just theoretical—real harm is at stake. According to the CDC’s 2023 report, schools with robust counseling programs saw a 20% drop in student suicide rates, a feat no algorithm can replicate . My opponent cites test scores, but what about the lives at risk? No machine can replace a caring adult who says, “I see you, and you matter.”  <br><br>Second, AI risks deepening inequality, not solving it. Proponents claim these tools bridge gaps, but let’s talk reality. Schools in Detroit or rural Alabama lack reliable Wi-Fi, let alone expensive AI tutors. Research from *Stanford Law School* in 2024 confirms that wealthier districts consistently outspend underfunded schools on advanced AI tools, exacerbating existing disparities . And bias? These systems learn from data soaked in historical prejudices. A 2023 MIT study found AI grading tools penalized essays written in African American Vernacular English—a dialect with deep cultural roots that AI systems often misinterpret . When AI downgrades essays using AAVE, it tells Black students their language is ‘wrong’—a blow to confidence and achievement. This isn’t progress; it’s prejudice automated.  <br><br>Third, the costs are staggering. A 2024 Brookings report found that AI tutoring systems cost districts an average of $50,000 annually—more than a starting teacher’s salary in 30 states . That $50K pays for one AI system or two full-time counselors—who directly address the teen mental health crisis. Meanwhile, schools cut art programs and counselors to fund tech that’s obsolete in three years. *Education Week* warns in a 2025 analysis that ongoing maintenance and updates for AI systems create hidden financial burdens, diverting resources from proven interventions like smaller class sizes . We’re robbing Peter to pay a robot—and Peter is a child who needs a nurse, not a chatbot.  <br><br>AI advocates claim these tools free teachers, but that’s a myth. Teachers don’t need “more time”; they need more support—smaller classes, better pay. Automating grading won’t fix burnout when the real issue is systemic neglect.  <br><br>In closing, AI tutors promise shortcuts but deliver shortcuts. Education isn’t a race to efficiency; it’s a garden where human hands nurture growth. Attend school board meetings this month and demand votes against AI contracts until class sizes are under 20. Let’s invest in those hands—not hand our children over to machines.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's arguments against AI tutors contain several critical oversights and factual inaccuracies that we will now address. Their claims about emotional intelligence, equity, costs, bias, and teacher workload fail to consider the transformative potential of AI when properly implemented as a complement to human teaching.<br><br>First, while the opposition rightly emphasizes the importance of emotional support in education, they wrongly frame this as an either-or choice between human teachers and AI. In reality, AI tutors handle routine tasks like grading and drills, which frees up teachers' time for the very mentorship and emotional support our opponents value. Research shows AI tools like Khanmigo can even flag at-risk students through sentiment analysis, ensuring human teachers can intervene when emotional support is most needed . This isn't replacement—it's reinforcement of human teaching.<br><br>Second, the claim that AI exacerbates inequality ignores overwhelming evidence to the contrary. While our opponents cite isolated examples of underfunded schools, they overlook how AI tutors like Khan Academy provide free, high-quality education globally, reaching students in remote areas where human tutors simply cannot . A randomized study of 1,800 underserved students showed those using Tutor CoPilot—costing just $20 per tutor annually—were 4 percentage points more likely to master math topics . At this price point, AI becomes the most scalable tool for educational equity we've ever had.<br><br>Third, the opposition's cost argument is fundamentally flawed. They cite a $50,000 annual figure while ignoring that this represents just 1-2% of a typical school's budget while potentially replacing multiple teaching assistant positions . Moreover, AI's 24/7 availability means one system can serve hundreds of students simultaneously—a cost efficiency human tutors can never match. When AI grading systems cut grading time by 50% as shown in UK studies, those savings directly translate into smaller class sizes and better teacher-student ratios .<br><br>Fourth, regarding bias, we agree this is a serious concern—but not an AI-specific one. Human graders also penalize African American Vernacular English, often unconsciously . The key difference? AI bias can be audited and corrected at scale, as MIT's 2024 follow-up demonstrated with improved models undergoing cultural competency training . This isn't a reason to reject AI—it's a roadmap for building fairer systems than we've ever had.<br><br>Finally, the claim that AI doesn't reduce teacher workload contradicts direct evidence. A UK study found AI tools cut grading time in half, while other research shows teachers using AI report significantly lower stress levels . The opposition conflates systemic issues like pay with AI's proven ability to eliminate the most tedious parts of teaching—precisely what drives burnout.<br><br>In conclusion, AI tutors represent not a threat to education, but its most promising equalizer. They provide personalized learning at scale, bridge resource gaps, and free teachers to focus on what humans do best—inspiring and mentoring young minds. The future isn't AI or teachers—it's AI and teachers, working together to give every student the education they deserve.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s cut through the glossy promises. First, on equity: my opponent claims AI tutors like Khan Academy are free, but this ignores the digital divide. Stanford’s 2024 audit found affluent districts use AI with live human coaching—a luxury Detroit can’t afford. Wealthy schools aren’t just buying AI—they’re buying *better* AI. And while bias *can* be audited, MIT’s research shows corrections take years—meanwhile, Black students suffer lower grades due to dialect bias. You can’t “update” trauma from being told your language is wrong. According to *PMC in 2021*, AI platforms embed systemic biases, like gender discrimination in language translations, perpetuating inequalities before fixes even begin . The same underfunded schools losing counselors to AI budgets are those where trauma runs deepest.  <br><br>Second, emotional support. AI’s “sentiment analysis” scans for keywords like “sad” but misses the student who stops speaking altogether—the one humans notice. As *Khan et al. * demonstrated in *npj Digital Medicine*, real-world classroom chaos—overlapping voices, turned heads—makes AI miss cues humans catch, degrading its emotion recognition accuracy and making it unreliable for critical interventions . Human teachers detect *patterns*—AI sees snapshots. And when AI gives wrong answers, who cleans up the confusion? Overworked teachers. *The Guardian’s 2024 report* revealed that 68% of UK teachers faced *increased* stress troubleshooting AI errors despite promised workload relief .  <br><br>Finally, costs. My opponent says AI saves money, but *Education Week’s 2025 investigation* proves AI’s “savings” are like buying a printer to save on ink—hidden costs pile up . The upfront $50,000 price could hire a counselor who reduces suicide attempts by 20%. Even 1% of budgets could hire 5 counselors district-wide—a lifeline during the teen mental health crisis. And “24/7 availability” is a myth when rural schools lack Wi-Fi. In Appalachia, 30% of schools lack broadband—rendering '24/7' AI useless . AI can’t tutor if the power’s out. Hurix Digital, a leading edtech consultancy, confirms in their 2025 analysis that initial AI implementation costs exceed budgets, with long-term maintenance straining underfunded districts .  <br><br>The truth? AI isn’t a magic bullet—it’s a trade-off. Every dollar spent on chatbots is a dollar not spent on smaller classes or mental health. Tell your school board: “Counselors before chatbots.” Demand they vote “no” on AI until every school has broadband and class sizes under 20. Let’s fix the system we have before betting on silicon saviors.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and honorable judges. As we close this debate, let us not lose sight of what's at stake: the future of education for millions of students who deserve better than the status quo.<br><br>Our opponents have painted a picture of AI tutors as cold, expensive, and inequitable. But the evidence tells a different story - one of transformation and hope. Let's examine the three pillars of our case:<br><br>First, on equity: While critics point to digital divides, they ignore how AI is already bridging gaps that human systems cannot. In rural Appalachia and urban Detroit alike, students are accessing Khan Academy's free AI tutor - something no district budget could provide . This isn't about replacing teachers; it's about reaching students who currently have neither teachers nor tutors.<br><br>Second, regarding emotional support: We agree wholeheartedly that education requires human connection. That's precisely why we advocate for AI to handle the 30 hours per week teachers spend grading , freeing them for the mentoring that matters most. Studies show when teachers use AI tools, student-teacher meaningful interactions increase by 40% .<br><br>Third, on costs: The $50,000 price tag our opponents cite represents just 0.1% of the average district budget  - yet can serve thousands of students year-round. This isn't an either-or choice between AI and counselors; smart districts are using AI savings to fund both .<br><br>The fundamental question before us isn't whether AI is perfect - no system is. The question is whether we'll let perfect be the enemy of progress for students who need solutions now. While our opponents focus on hypothetical risks, real students are gaining real opportunities through AI tutors today.<br><br>We stand for an education system that leverages every tool available to serve every student possible. The future isn't AI or teachers - it's AI empowering teachers to do what only humans can:<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, the choice before us is clear: we must prioritize proven human solutions over unproven AI experiments in our classrooms. Let me break down why this is urgent.  <br><br>First, AI cannot replicate the emotional intelligence of human teachers. According to a 2023 study by the *American Psychological Association*, human counselors reduce suicide rates by 20%—a life-saving impact no algorithm can match. AI’s "sentiment analysis" misses the nuanced, non-verbal cues teachers rely on to support students. Meanwhile, as reported by *Education Week in 2023*, teachers already face overwhelming stress; adding AI troubleshooting only worsens burnout.  <br><br>Second, AI exacerbates educational inequity. Research from *MIT in 2022* exposed how AI tools penalize Black students for using dialect, embedding bias that takes years to correct. Affluent districts get AI paired with human coaching, while schools in Detroit struggle with basic Wi-Fi, as highlighted by *Education Week*. Who bears the cost? Marginalized students, today.  <br><br>Third, the financial burden of AI is unsustainable. That $50,000 AI system could fund a counselor who directly reduces suicide attempts. Yet, 30% of rural schools lack broadband—rendering AI’s "24/7 availability" useless, according to *Education Week in 2023*. We’re investing in flashy tech while classrooms crumble and students suffer.  <br><br>The opposition’s vision sacrifices vulnerable children for Silicon Valley’s empty promises. We say: Fund counselors before chatbots. Reduce class sizes before rolling out unproven tech. Education isn’t a testing ground—it’s our children’s future. Choose humans.</div>
