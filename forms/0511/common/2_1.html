                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good evening, everyone. Tonight, we stand in firm support of the motion: *Labor unions are beneficial to economic growth*. Labor unions are organizations where workers unite to negotiate for better pay, safer conditions, and fair treatment. This collective voice doesn’t just help employees—it strengthens the entire economy by driving wages, fairness, and innovation.  <br><br>Our judging criteria are clear: economic growth thrives when wages rise, inequality shrinks, and innovation flourishes. Unions deliver on all three fronts.  <br><br>First, unions increase wages, and higher wages fuel growth. According to a 2023 Economic Policy Institute report, unions raise wages by 13% on average—fueling $10 billion in annual consumer spending. When workers earn more, they spend more. A factory worker with a union-backed raise buys groceries, repairs their car, and invests in their kids’ education. That spending ripples outward, supporting local businesses and creating jobs. Research from the WorkRise Network in 2023 confirms that unions boost lifetime earnings by $1.3 million per worker, directly fueling economic demand. Without unions, wages stagnate, and so does the economy.  <br><br>Critics warn this could spike inflation, but Sweden’s central bank found no significant link—unions grow economies *without* destabilizing them. A 2004 Sveriges Riksbank study confirmed that wage increases do not lead to significant inflation, debunking this common myth.  <br><br>Second, unions balance power to prevent exploitation. Without them, employers can cut corners—slashing wages, ignoring safety, or overworking staff. That doesn’t just hurt workers; it hurts the economy. Burnt-out employees are less productive. Unfair pay breeds discontent, leading to high turnover and wasted training costs. Unions stop this cycle. As highlighted by the WorkRise Network, unionized workplaces experience lower turnover, reducing costs while ensuring workers are paid fairly. They ensure workers have a seat at the table, so companies grow *with* their employees, not at their expense. This isn’t just fair—it’s smart economics.  <br><br>Higher wages and fair conditions don’t just sustain workers—they free them to *innovate*. Finally, unions foster innovation. Better pay and job security let workers focus on big ideas, not just scraping by. A 2021 study published in the *Journal of Labor Economics* found that unions act as "collective voice institutions," boosting productivity and innovation by encouraging worker input. Modern examples prove this: Google’s union pushed for ethical AI, attracting top talent and investor confidence. From auto plants to app-based drivers, unions adapt to new work models—like the Uber drivers’ union securing benefits in California. Unions also lead in training for new technologies. Daniel Bustillo, director of the Healthcare Career Advancement Program, emphasizes that unions collaborate with employers to retrain workers for automated workplaces, ensuring adaptability. When workers aren’t worried about making rent, they can problem-solve, invent, and drive progress.  <br><br>Critics claim unions resist change, but the evidence contradicts this. German unions, for instance, played a pivotal role in transitioning to green energy, proving unions negotiate *for* adaptability.  <br><br>To sum up: unions boost wages, protect fairness, and spark innovation. They’re not just good for workers—they’re the backbone of a thriving economy. We urge you to support this motion by voting for leaders who protect collective bargaining—our economy depends on it. Thank you.  <br><br><br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that labor unions are detrimental to economic growth. Labor unions are organizations formed by workers to negotiate collectively with employers over wages, working conditions, and benefits. While they aim to protect workers, they impose rigidities in labor markets that hinder economic efficiency. Economic growth refers to an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over time, typically measured by GDP. Sustainable growth requires productivity, innovation, and labor market flexibility.<br><br>Our judging criteria is economic efficiency and long-term competitiveness. The debate should be evaluated based on whether labor unions enhance or hinder the economy's ability to adapt, innovate, and maintain sustainable growth. We will demonstrate that unions reduce labor market flexibility, increase costs, and stifle innovation, ultimately harming economic growth.<br><br>First, labor unions increase costs and reduce competitiveness. Unions negotiate higher wages and benefits, which raise labor costs for businesses. Research indicates that unionized workers earn 10-30% higher wages than non-unionized workers in similar roles . These increased costs lead to higher prices for consumers and reduced profitability for firms. For example, a study by the Heritage Foundation found that unionized manufacturing firms faced 15-20% higher labor costs compared to non-unionized competitors, contributing to the decline of unionized manufacturing jobs in the U.S. . This cost burden forces companies to either relocate operations to lower-cost regions or automate jobs, ultimately reducing employment opportunities in unionized sectors.<br><br>Second, unions stifle innovation and productivity. Unionized workplaces often resist changes in work processes or technology adoption to protect jobs. Studies show that passing a union election leads to an 8.7% decline in patent quantity and 12.5% decline in patent quality three years after the election . This occurs because unions compress wage differentials, reducing incentives for high-performing workers and driving away innovative talent. Furthermore, unionized firms reduce R&D expenditures by an average of 6% compared to their non-unionized counterparts , directly harming long-term economic growth potential.<br><br>Third, unions contribute to job losses and economic inflexibility. Rigid union contracts make it difficult for businesses to adjust to economic downturns. For instance, General Motors shed tens of thousands of jobs over the past decade while the UAW refused concessions that could have improved competitiveness . Similarly, UPS laid off workers due to falling demand combined with high union labor costs . These examples demonstrate how union demands can accelerate job losses rather than protect employment. Data shows that while union manufacturing employment declined by 75% since 1983, non-union manufacturing jobs actually increased by 6% during the same period , proving that unionization correlates with job losses.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions harm economic growth by increasing costs, reducing competitiveness, stifling innovation, and contributing to job losses. While they may benefit some workers in the short term, their long-term economic consequences are overwhelmingly negative.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s dismantle the opponent’s arguments with evidence and clarity.  <br><br>First, they claim unions raise costs and hurt competitiveness. This ignores the economic reality that higher wages fuel growth. Research from the *U.S. Department of the Treasury* in 2023 confirms unions boost wages by 10–15%, directly increasing consumer spending—the engine of local economies. When unions negotiate fair pay, workers reinvest those dollars in haircuts, car repairs, and dinners out. The opponent cites labor costs but overlooks the $10 billion in annual consumer spending unions generate. If higher wages killed competitiveness, why does Germany—where unions co-manage productivity—lead in manufacturing? Unions don’t drain profits; they *redistribute* them to sustain demand.  <br><br>Second, the opponent’s claim about R&D spending ignores reality. Boeing’s unionized 787 team delivered groundbreaking innovations while cutting costs, proving unions don’t stifle progress. The 6% R&D reduction claim cherry-picks data while ignoring *MIT research* from 2023 showing unionized firms file *more* patents when workers share profits. Unions drive innovation through collaboration, not conflict. Take IBM’s union contract: it standardizes base pay while offering 15–20% bonuses for top performers, demonstrating how fairness and merit coexist. Google’s union pushed for ethical AI, attracting talent who value worker voice. German unions retrained auto workers for electric vehicles, proving unions don’t resist change—they *channel* it. The opponent’s narrative collapses under these examples.  <br><br>Third, the GM/UPS job-loss argument is misleading. The UAW’s 2019 concessions saved *three Ohio plants*—proof unions adapt to preserve jobs. GM’s decline stemmed from *management* failures, not labor costs. Meanwhile, non-union job growth often means lower wages and higher turnover, which *hurts* long-term productivity. A 2015 *Department of Labor* study of 50 unionized workplaces found 25% lower absenteeism and stronger training outcomes. The 75% union decline in manufacturing? That’s globalization and automation—unions fought to *retrain* workers, not cling to obsolete roles. The UAW’s "JOBS Bank" retrained 80% of displaced workers for tech positions, showing adaptation, not resistance.  <br><br>Finally, unions stabilize economies. They standardize wages but still reward merit—like IBM’s union-negotiated bonuses for top performers. According to *Forbes* in 2023, unions now partner with employers on AI and green tech, ensuring workers *and* companies benefit from innovation. The opponent’s narrow focus on costs ignores how unions prevent exploitation, boost productivity, and sustain consumer demand. Without them, inequality widens, spending power shrinks, and growth stalls.  <br><br>Unions transform challenges into progress. They turn wages into growth, conflict into collaboration, and job losses into retraining opportunities. Economies with strong unions—like Denmark and Germany—outperform because they balance fairness with flexibility. The opponent blames unions for broader economic shifts, but the evidence is clear: unions don’t *cost* jobs—they *transform* them. They don’t stifle innovation—they *democratize* it. Unions are the backbone of a fairer economy—where wages become growth, and workers drive progress.  <br><br><br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges and colleagues, while the affirmative team presents unions as economic saviors, their arguments contain four critical flaws we must address: they misattribute Germany's success to unions alone, cherry-pick innovation examples while ignoring systemic R&D declines, blame external factors for union-driven job losses, and overlook how union rigidity creates long-term economic harm.<br><br>First, on wages and growth, the affirmative claims unions boost consumer spending through higher wages. This ignores how concentrated wage hikes distort markets. Research shows that while unionized manufacturing jobs declined by 75% since 1983, non-union manufacturing jobs grew by 6% . Why? Because when unions force unsustainable labor costs—like the UAW’s $70/hour total compensation at GM—companies either automate or relocate . The $10 billion in union-driven consumer spending they cite is offset by the $15-20 billion in higher production costs that make U.S. goods uncompetitive . Germany thrives not because of unions, but despite them—its "flexicurity" system allows wage moderation during crises, which U.S. unions reject. <br><br>Second, their innovation argument collapses under scrutiny. They cite Boeing’s 787, but omit that union strikes caused 3-year delays and $12 billion in cost overruns . The MIT study they reference is an outlier—a metastudy in the *Journal of Financial Economics* found unionized firms reduce R&D by 6% and lose top inventors . At Tesla’s non-union Fremont plant, productivity is 30% higher than UAW plants because merit-based bonuses—not rigid pay scales—drive innovation . Unions don’t democratize ideas; they standardize mediocrity.<br><br>Third, their defense of GM and UPS job losses is misleading. The UAW didn’t "save" Ohio plants—it delayed their automation until GM collapsed, while Tesla created 50,000 non-union jobs adapting to electric vehicles . The affirmative blames globalization, but OECD data proves nations with flexible labor markets  retain manufacturing jobs by adjusting wages during downturns . Unions don’t transform jobs; they fossilize them.<br><br>Finally, their "stabilization" claim backfires. German unions did support green energy—but by demanding lavish subsidies, they made Germany’s electricity costs 40% higher than the U.S. . Meanwhile, non-union Amazon invested $1.2 billion in upskilling programs without collective bargaining . Worker protections need not come at the cost of economic dynamism.<br><br>In sum, unions create zero-sum economics: short-term gains for members, long-term losses for growth. The affirmative’s equity-focused metrics ignore how their policies reduce the pie for everyone. True prosperity requires the flexibility unions inherently oppose.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, the evidence overwhelmingly confirms that labor unions are a driving force behind economic growth. Let’s examine the facts.  <br><br>First, unions fuel economic expansion through higher wages and consumer spending. According to the *U.S. Treasury Department’s 2022 report*, union wages inject an additional $10 billion annually into local economies, supporting small businesses and sustaining demand. Germany’s union co-management model, as documented by the *Berlin School of Economics in 2021*, demonstrates that high wages and global manufacturing competitiveness are not mutually exclusive—they’re mutually reinforcing. Higher wages create a virtuous cycle of growth.  <br><br>Second, unions are catalysts for innovation, not obstacles. Research from *MIT’s Sloan School of Management in 2020* reveals that unionized firms with profit-sharing file 14% more patents, proving collaboration sparks creativity. While critics point to Boeing’s delays, they overlook its union-developed breakthroughs like the 787 Dreamliner. Tesla’s non-union model is an outlier—most gig economy jobs lack the stability or resources to invest in research and development.  <br><br>Third, unions safeguard jobs while adapting to change. The *Washington Post’s 2019 reporting* on the UAW’s retraining programs shows how unions saved Ohio plants by transitioning workers into tech roles. GM’s decline wasn’t due to labor costs but management’s failure to innovate—a stark contrast to union-led resilience.  <br><br>Unions transform wages into spending, conflict into collaboration, and job losses into new opportunities. Economies thrive when workers have a seat at the table. The choice is clear: Vote for growth. Vote for unions.  <br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today’s debate centered on whether labor unions genuinely drive economic growth or impose rigidities that stifle it. Let’s revisit the core clashes where our arguments prevailed.<br><br>**Economic Efficiency vs. Wage-Driven Growth**  <br>The affirmative claims unions boost growth through higher wages, but this ignores the broader economic distortions they create. While unions may raise wages for some, studies show these gains come at the cost of competitiveness—unionized manufacturing jobs declined by 75% since 1983, while non-union manufacturing grew by 6% . The affirmative’s cherry-picked examples, like Germany, overlook its "flexicurity" system, which allows wage moderation during crises—a flexibility U.S. unions reject. Meanwhile, non-union firms like Tesla achieve wage growth through merit-based incentives without sacrificing adaptability . Higher wages in isolation don’t equate to growth when they drive production overseas or accelerate automation.<br><br>**Innovation and Productivity**  <br>The affirmative cites outlier cases like Boeing’s 787, omitting that union strikes caused $12 billion in overruns . Metastudies in the *Journal of Financial Economics* confirm unionized firms reduce R&D by 6% and lose top inventors . Tesla’s non-union Fremont plant, with 30% higher productivity than UAW facilities, proves innovation thrives under meritocracy, not rigid pay scales . Unions compress wage differentials, disincentivizing high performers and driving talent elsewhere. The affirmative’s "democratized innovation" narrative collapses under systemic evidence.<br><br>**Job Preservation vs. Flexibility**  <br>The UAW’s JOBS Bank didn’t save manufacturing—it delayed automation until GM collapsed, while non-union Tesla created 50,000 jobs adapting to electric vehicles <br><br></div>
