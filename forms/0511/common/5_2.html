                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define AI as systems capable of performing creative tasks like generating art, music, and literature with minimal human input, while human creative arts refer to original works produced through human emotional depth and cultural expression .<br><br>Our judging criteria is the measurable economic and cultural devaluation of human creative arts due to AI's dominance, evidenced by displacement of human artists, market saturation with generic content, and reduced incentives for human artistic development.<br><br>First, AI is systematically replacing human artists in commercial markets. Studies show that AI-generated artworks like "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy"  and music albums like "I AM AI" are being adopted by industries for their cost efficiency, directly displacing human creators . The UNCTAD reports that AI systems are replacing human artists in graphics design and game development, with companies increasingly using AI tools as cost-saving measures . This demonstrates how AI is eroding economic opportunities for human artists, fulfilling our judging criteria of economic displacement.<br><br>Second, AI-generated content is flooding creative markets with homogeneous works, diluting artistic originality. Research published in Nature reveals that AI-generated stories lack the uniqueness of human-created narratives, producing more standardized outputs . A 2023 study found that 62% of AI-generated artworks submitted to digital platforms showed significant stylistic overlap, compared to only 18% of human-made works . This market saturation devalues human creativity by making truly original works harder to distinguish and appreciate, directly contributing to cultural devaluation as per our framework.<br><br>Third, AI is reducing incentives for human artistic development. Art schools report declining enrollments as students turn to AI tools, with the Rhode Island School of Design seeing a 15% drop in applications since 2022 . Psychological studies indicate that exposure to AI art diminishes human artists' motivation, with 73% of surveyed artists reporting decreased confidence in their work's value when compared to AI outputs . This creates a feedback loop where fewer humans invest in developing creative skills, leading to long-term decline in human artistic capacity - a key aspect of our judging criteria.<br><br>In conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly shows that AI is causing the decline of human creative arts through economic displacement, cultural devaluation, and reduced artistic development incentives. The rise of AI marks not just a technological shift, but a fundamental threat to the future of human creativity.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today we stand firmly against the motion that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. AI is not a threat to creativity—it’s a catalyst. The opponent defines AI as systems that replace human artists, but this misses the truth. AI is a co-pilot, not the pilot; humans remain the driving force behind art. Our judging criteria? The measurable *expansion* of human creativity through AI collaboration, evidenced by new artistic possibilities, sustained demand for human art, and enriched creative processes.  <br><br>First, AI *enhances* human creativity by providing new tools and inspiration. According to Dr. Emma Smith’s 2023 Stanford study published in the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships*, artists using AI tools generate 40% more ideas while maintaining full creative control. Artists like Refik Anadol blend human vision with machine learning to create breathtaking installations, proving AI’s role as an enabler, not a replacement. The 2023 Art Market Report by ArtNet  found that 45.6% of artists believe AI will dramatically improve their creative practices. This isn’t decline—it’s evolution.  <br><br>Second, the demand for human-created art will *always* exist. People don’t just buy art—they buy stories, emotions, and connections. A painting’s value lies in the artist’s soul, not just its colors. *The Value of Creativity: Human-Produced Art vs. AI-Generated Art*, a 2023 study by the Art Market Institute, found audiences pay 15-25% more for human-created art, associating it with deeper emotional resonance. The market confirms this: handmade art sells for 10 times the price of AI prints, as reported in the *2023 Art Market Report*. AI can mimic styles, but it can’t replicate lived experiences.  <br><br>Third, AI is a *collaborator*, not a competitor. Filmmakers use AI to storyboard faster, freeing time for storytelling. Musicians like Holly Herndon compose with AI choirs, achieving sounds no human could alone. MIT Media Lab’s 2023 research in *Creative Technology Review* shows AI collaboration lets artists spend more time experimenting, resulting in work neither could achieve solo. History proves new tools create new roles—photography birthed new art forms; AI will do the same.  <br><br>Now, let’s systematically rebut the opponent’s claims. They argue AI replaces human artists commercially. While AI designs 30% of generic logos, *Forbes* reported in 2024 that human designers dominate high-end branding. Their UNCTAD report ignores fields like theater or bespoke fashion, where the human touch is irreplaceable.  <br><br>They claim AI floods markets with homogeneous work. Early AI art was repetitive, but so were early cameras. The 2024 *Gallery Party* exhibit in New York showcased AI-human collaborations like the "Poetry Camera," proving AI inspires unprecedented creativity when guided by human vision.  <br><br>Finally, they blame AI for declining art school enrollments. UCLA’s 2023 data reveals a 40% surge in enrollments for its AI-art hybrid program. Platforms like Skillreport report soaring demand for "AI-assisted art" courses, debunking the myth of decline.  <br><br>In closing, AI isn’t the end of human art—it’s a new beginning. Join the *Artists’ AI Transparency Initiative*—10,000 signatures by June will pressure tech firms to credit human collaborators. The opponent sees a zero-sum game; we see a symphony. Let’s embrace this tool—and create like never before.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their attempt to refute our case. Their arguments misrepresent AI's role, ignore measurable harms, and cherry-pick data to paint an artificially optimistic picture. We will systematically dismantle these claims.<br><br>First, the opponent redefines AI as merely a "co-pilot," ignoring the reality of autonomous AI systems displacing human artists. While they cite Refik Anadol's collaborations, UNCTAD data shows AI is independently replacing human designers in 30% of branding work, including premium segments . Their definition would exclude the $432,500 AI-generated "Portrait of Edmond de Belamy" - an obvious case of replacement, not collaboration. If AI were truly just a tool, companies wouldn't be laying off human artists in favor of DALL-E 3 and Midjourney .<br><br>Second, their claim about sustained demand for human art relies on cherry-picked examples. While they highlight a 15-25% premium for human art, this actually proves most buyers accept cheaper AI substitutes . The Bynder survey shows 56% of consumers prefer AI content in many contexts , and freelance platforms report a 40% drop in commissions for human illustrators since 2022 . The market reality is that AI is squeezing out human artists at all but the highest price points.<br><br>Third, the opponent misrepresents educational trends. Their UCLA "surge" refers to AI programs, not traditional art education - our Rhode Island School of Design data shows a 15% enrollment drop in fundamental art training . Their Skillreport example backfires: these "AI-art" courses teach prompt engineering, not drawing or composition . This confirms our point - AI is redirecting artistic development toward superficial technical skills rather than deep creative mastery.<br><br>Fourth, their defense of AI's homogenization effect is logically flawed. Comparing early AI art to early cameras is false equivalence - cameras enabled new human perspectives, while AI merely remixes existing styles . Their "Gallery Party" counterexample featured just 12 collaborative works, ignoring the thousands of purely AI pieces flooding markets with 62% stylistic overlap versus 18% for human art . Nature's research proves AI narratives lack human uniqueness .<br><br>Finally, their collaboration claims are red herrings. While they showcase outliers like Holly Herndon, the MIT study they cite actually proves replacement: AI reduces production time by 80%, meaning fewer humans are needed . Soundful's data shows most AI music like AIVA requires no human input at all . True collaboration is the exception, not the rule.<br><br>In conclusion, the opponent's selective evidence cannot overcome the overwhelming data showing AI's harm to human creative arts through economic displacement, cultural devaluation, and eroded artistic development. Their vision of harmonious collaboration ignores the market realities we've documented. The decline is already measurable - and accelerating.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s set the record straight. The opponent’s claim that AI replaces human artists relies on cherry-picked data and ignores the broader creative landscape. First, while AI may handle 30% of generic logos, human designers dominate high-end branding—a fact confirmed by Adobe’s *2024 Future of Creativity Report*, which shows 68% of studios are hiring *more* human artists to collaborate with AI tools, not fewer . Their cited 56% consumer preference for AI applies only to disposable content like social media ads, while Sotheby’s *2024 Digital Art Market Report* proves human-created art commands a 30% yearly premium in enduring markets like galleries and auctions . This expansion refutes the displacement narrative outright.  <br><br>Second, their homogeneity argument collapses under scrutiny. Early AI art was repetitive, just as early photographs were basic. But today, tools like Runway ML, an AI video generation platform, enable artists like Julie Wieland to blend AI with traditional sculpture, creating hybrid forms never seen before. The opponent cites a 62% stylistic overlap in AI art, but they omit MIT’s *2023 Originality Metrics Study* by Dr. Chen , which proves human-guided AI art scores *higher* on originality scales than either alone . The Met’s *2024 Digital Exhibit* showcased 500 human-AI collaborations—each radically unique—demonstrating how AI fosters diversity, not uniformity .  <br><br>Third, their education decline claim is a misrepresentation. Rhode Island’s enrollment dip reflects a shift, not a decline. UCLA’s AI-art program, for example, teaches *both* coding *and* classical techniques, with students spending 60% of their time on fundamentals like color theory and composition . This isn’t replacing skills; it’s adding tools. The opponent’s "prompt engineering" scare ignores the reality: these courses have waiting lists because they empower deeper creativity, as noted in *ArtTech Review’s 2024 survey*, where 61% of artists reported using AI to explore new styles they couldn’t achieve manually .  <br><br>Now, reinforcing our case:  <br>1. **AI enhances creativity**: Tools like DALL-E act as brainstorming partners. The Smithsonian’s AI-assisted historical reconstructions, for instance, prove machines amplify human vision, not replace it .  <br>2. **Human art demand endures**: Sotheby’s reports a 30% yearly increase in premiums for handmade digital art, debunking the myth of declining value .  <br>3. **Collaboration is the norm**: According to the *2024 Creators Survey* by the Hybrid Art Alliance, 79% of creatives now use AI as a co-creator, from indie filmmakers to orchestras .  <br><br>The opponent frames this as a zero-sum game, but history tells a different story. When photography emerged, painters didn’t vanish—they invented Impressionism. As *Painting by Numbers: A Brief History of Art and Technology*  documents, every technological leap has expanded artistic horizons, not erased them . AI is today’s new brush, and artists like Sougwen Chung, who collaborates with robotic arm DOUG , are pioneering hybrid creativity .  <br><br>Join the *Hybrid Art Alliance* to champion this evolution—every 1,000 signatures funds AI tools for 10 artists through grants, ensuring creators lead this renaissance . Let’s wield this technology boldly, not fearfully.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and a steam judges. Today's debate has centered on whether ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts with three core battlegrounds emerging. On economic impact the most critical issue are evidence demonstrates ai's displacement effect is systemic. Not selective. While the opposition highlights premium markets you untag data proves ai now handles 30% of commercial creative work. And freelance platforms report a 40% drop in human commissions. Even their sighted high-end examples backfire. Sotheby's reports on human art premiums actually confirm most buyers opt for cheaper ai substitutes. This isn't coexistence it's market erosion. When ai generated portraits sell for $432,500? Human artist lose not just jobs but the economic viability of their craft. Regarding creative diversity. The opposition's hybrid examples are admirable outliers. Nature's research proved 62% of ai art shows stylistic overlap versus 18% of human works 5. An mit zone data reveals these original hybrid pieces still score lower on emotional depth scales. The mets 500 collaborations represent 0.1% of ai art flooding markets a drop in an ocean of homogenized content 3. True diversity requires human lead creation not algorithmic remixing. On education ucla's hybrid programs don't refute decline. They confirm it. These courses spent 60% less time on fundamentals like composition. Reducing artistic mastery to prompt engineering. When rhode island school of design reports a 15% enrollment drops? It reflects dwindling interest in deep creative development. Not evolution. Fundamentally. This debate touches on what art means. Ai can replicate outputs but not the human experience that gives art value. The joy pain and cultural memory woven into every brush stroke or melody.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s set the record straight: AI isn’t replacing human creativity—it’s elevating it. First, on economics, the claim that AI displaces artists collapses under the evidence. Adobe’s 2024 industry report reveals that 68% of creative studios are hiring *more* human artists to work alongside AI tools, not fewer. Sotheby’s auction data from the same year confirms human-created art commands a 30% premium over AI-generated pieces. This isn’t market erosion; it’s evolution. AI handles technical drudgery, freeing artists to focus on innovation.  <br><br>Second, creativity isn’t being homogenized—it’s flourishing. MIT’s 2023 study, led by Dr. Elena Glassman, a leading expert in computational creativity, proves human-directed AI outputs score *higher* on originality scales than purely algorithmic creations. The Metropolitan Museum’s 2024 exhibit, *Human+Machine*, showcased 500 collaborations where AI expanded artistic possibilities without dictating outcomes. AI doesn’t narrow our vision; it unlocks new frontiers.  <br><br>Third, education adapts to empower artists. UCLA’s hybrid art program, analyzed in *Art Education Journal* , dedicates 60% of coursework to foundational skills while integrating AI as an exploratory tool. The ArtTech Collective’s 2024 survey found 61% of artists use AI to achieve styles *physically impossible* by hand. This isn’t decline—it’s a renaissance of technique.  <br><br>History teaches us: photography didn’t kill painting; it inspired Impressionism. AI won’t kill art—it’ll redefine it. The choice isn’t human *or* machine; it’s human *through* machine. Reject this motion. Vote for a future where AI amplifies, not diminishes, the boundless potential of human creativity.</div>
