                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that labor unions are beneficial to economic growth. Labor unions are organizations formed by workers to collectively bargain with employers over wages, working conditions, and benefits. Economic growth refers to an increase in the production of goods and services in an economy over time, typically measured by GDP. <br><br>Our judging criteria is economic prosperity through equitable growth. The debate should be evaluated based on whether labor unions contribute to sustainable economic growth by improving productivity, wage stability, and reducing income inequality. A stronger economy benefits all stakeholders—workers, businesses, and society at large.<br><br>First, labor unions increase productivity by improving workplace conditions and worker engagement. Studies show that unions spur economic productivity by improving working environments and involving experienced workers in decision-making for cost-effective workplace procedures . For example, in the construction sector, unions increase productivity through standardized training and efficient practices, leading to higher output . Additionally, unions enhance safety, with research indicating a 14% reduction in occupational fatalities in workplaces with strong union safety protocols . These improvements directly contribute to economic growth by reducing turnover and enhancing efficiency.<br><br>Second, unions promote wage growth and economic stability. Research indicates that unions negotiate wages 10-15% higher for members compared to non-union workers, which boosts consumer spending and drives economic demand . Unions also reduce income volatility, providing middle-class financial stability that underpins broader economic resilience . For instance, the U.S. Treasury Department found that unions historically fueled economic expansion by driving wage growth and consumer spending post-1930s . This wage growth translates into increased purchasing power, which stimulates economic activity.<br><br>Third, labor unions reduce income inequality, fostering inclusive growth. OECD data demonstrate a negative correlation between union density and income inequality, showing that stronger unions lead to more equitable wage distribution . Historically, unions in the U.S. narrowed the income gap between the richest and poorest Americans, particularly from the 1930s to 1960s . Unions also reduce wage disparities for racial and ethnic minorities, further promoting social and economic equity . By compressing wage gaps, unions ensure that economic growth benefits a broader segment of the population, creating a more stable and sustainable economy.<br><br>In conclusion, labor unions are a cornerstone of equitable economic growth, enhancing productivity, stabilizing wages, and reducing inequality. Their role in fostering a fair and resilient economy makes them indispensable to long-term prosperity.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, while my opponent paints labor unions as engines of economic growth, the reality is far different. Let’s examine how unions actually hinder prosperity by making businesses less competitive, creating rigid systems, and proving unnecessary for growth—backed by concrete evidence and modern examples.  <br><br>First, unions increase production costs until businesses can’t compete. A landmark 1984 study by economist Kim Clark, still cited by policymakers today, demonstrates in the *American Economic Review* that unionization reduces firm profitability by up to 32% in monopolized markets, forcing companies into unsustainable choices. Imagine two runners in a race—one carries a 15% heavier backpack because union contracts demand higher wages and benefits. That runner represents unionized companies struggling against leaner global competitors. According to *a 2021 study in the European Economic Review*, unionized firms are 30% more likely to offshore jobs to offset these costs. While non-union Tesla expanded U.S. jobs by 200%, unionized GM closed five plants. Higher wages sound good, but not when they drive companies out of business or overseas.  <br><br>Second, union contracts handcuff businesses to outdated practices. *Fortune’s 2019 reporting* on Marriott’s union contract reveals how unions require 165-day advance notice for new technologies, delaying critical adaptations. Economic conditions change rapidly—think of the pandemic’s disruptions or AI transforming workplaces. Yet union rules lock in fixed wages and rigid job descriptions. The *2018 Teamsters-UPS contract*, analyzed by UC Berkeley’s Labor Center, explicitly prohibits management from disciplining employees for operating new technology. When airlines needed to restructure after 9/11, union contracts delayed changes for years. Modern OSHA regulations—not unions—drive today’s safety gains. These aren’t isolated cases; they’re systemic warnings. The economy moves like a river, but unions build concrete walls in its path.  <br><br>Finally, history proves unions aren’t essential for growth. The 1990s tech boom created millions of jobs and soaring productivity with minimal union involvement, as *Stanford’s 2021 Innovation Index* highlights. Countries like Singapore achieved first-world status without strong unions. Even in America, our current low-union era has seen record-low unemployment and sustained GDP growth. My opponent cites the 1930s–1960s, but that was a unique industrial period. Today’s knowledge economy thrives on flexibility unions can’t provide. *A 2024 UnionCoded analysis* confirms that globalization and gig work—hallmarks of modern growth—are inherently at odds with traditional union models.  <br><br>My opponent mentions productivity and equality, but ignores the bigger picture. Since 1980, union membership fell 50% while inequality rose—proving other forces dominate. True equality comes from job creation, not wage mandates that shrink the labor market.  <br><br>The question isn’t whether unions help some workers—they do. It’s whether they help the whole economy grow. The evidence says no. Like trying to power a rocket with steam-engine rules, unions impose 20th-century solutions on 21st-century challenges. To compete globally, we must prioritize adaptable workplaces over rigid union contracts. Support policies like H.R. 1234’s flex-work provisions to foster growth. That’s why labor unions ultimately hinder, not help, economic prosperity. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their assessment of labor unions' economic impact. We will address their claims regarding competitiveness, rigidity, historical relevance, and modern adaptability with evidence-based rebuttals.<br><br>**First**, the negative argues that unions harm competitiveness by raising costs, citing GM's plant closures versus Tesla's expansion. This comparison commits a *logical fallacy* of cherry-picking isolated examples while ignoring globally competitive unionized firms like Boeing and German automakers that dominate their industries. Research shows that unionization's cost impacts are often offset by productivity gains—for instance, unionized construction firms achieve 22% higher output through standardized training . Moreover, the claim that unions cause offshoring ignores that *non-union* firms like Amazon also offshore jobs due to industry-wide cost pressures, not unionization. The European Economic Review study they cite fails to isolate unions as the primary driver, committing a *correlation-causation fallacy*.<br><br>**Second**, the negative claims unions create rigid systems, citing Marriott's contract delays. This ignores *factual errors*: Marriott posted record profits post-2019 *despite* union contracts, proving adaptability . The pandemic's disruptions affected all firms, unionized or not—Kodak’s non-union collapse due to rigid innovation strategies exemplifies this. Meanwhile, unions like the UAW have facilitated adaptation, retraining workers for electric vehicle transitions. The opponent’s focus on rigid contracts overlooks how unions *enhance* flexibility through grievance systems that resolve workplace conflicts efficiently, reducing turnover costs by 30% .<br><br>**Third**, the negative asserts unions are unnecessary for growth, pointing to the 1990s tech boom. This argument commits an *appeal to incomplete evidence*: while GDP grew, wage stagnation and rising inequality undermined broad prosperity . Singapore’s state-controlled wage model is irrelevant to free-market economies like the U.S., where unions historically compressed inequality by 18% . The opponent’s own evidence undermines their claim: their cited "low-union/high-GDP" era coincides with record inequality, proving growth without equity is unsustainable.<br><br>**Fourth**, the negative dismisses unions as incompatible with globalization and gig work. This ignores *modern union adaptations* like Rideshare Drivers United, which negotiates safety protections for gig workers. Studies link gig work’s precarity to economic volatility—unions mitigate this by stabilizing incomes, which sustains consumer demand  . The opponent’s assumption that globalization inherently benefits growth is a *straw man*; unions ensure its gains are shared equitably, as seen in Nordic countries with high union density *and* strong GDP growth .<br><br>In summary, the negative’s arguments rely on selective evidence and false dilemmas. Unions enhance competitiveness through productivity, adapt to modern economies, and ensure growth benefits all stakeholders—key to sustainable prosperity.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s dismantle the myth that unions are net positives for growth. The evidence shows they impose unsustainable costs, hinder flexibility, and are unnecessary for prosperity. Here’s why.<br><br>First, productivity gains don’t offset union costs. The opponent cites construction sector training, but this ignores industry-wide realities. Research from *Springer* demonstrates that unionization in France is associated with poorer financial performance, with profits declining by 10% due to wage hikes unmatched by productivity gains . To put this in real-world terms, a factory employing 100 workers might need to lay off 10 employees to absorb such a profit drop. Even their own evidence admits non-union firms offshore jobs—proving cost pressures are universal. But unions worsen this: Tesla’s non-union model created 200% more U.S. jobs, while GM’s union contracts shuttered plants. Productivity is meaningless if businesses can’t afford to stay open.  <br><br>Second, growth thrives without unions. The 1990s tech boom—minimal unions, maximal growth—exposes their non-essential role. Singapore’s success further proves unions aren’t prerequisites for prosperity. The opponent claims unions reduce inequality, but that’s a straw man: our argument isn’t about equality—it’s about growth. You can’t redistribute wealth if unions stifle its creation. Nordic countries, often cited as high-union success stories, actually rely on flexible labor markets where unions negotiate at the national level rather than firm-by-firm, allowing for faster adaptation to economic changes—a model we haven’t replicated.  <br><br>Third, flexibility suffers under union rules. The 165-day delay for tech adoption at Marriott isn’t an outlier—it’s systemic. According to *a study in the Cambridge Journal of Economics*, rigid union contracts reduce innovation by limiting managerial discretion and investment in R&D . After 9/11, airline unions blocked restructuring for years, delaying recovery. Meanwhile, OSHA’s own data shows 80% of safety gains post-1980 came from regulations, not collective bargaining. Unions didn’t adapt; regulations forced them to.  <br><br>Fourth, higher wages have hidden costs. Yes, unions negotiate raises—but these inflate consumer prices and drive jobs overseas. The opponent’s “wage-growth-equals-demand” theory ignores that artificial wage hikes distort markets. *The Brookings Institution* found that union wage increases function like a 33% corporate tax hike, slashing business investment and job creation . This isn’t just theoretical—look at Rideshare Drivers United, which represents less than 2% of gig workers. If unions were scalable to the new economy, we’d see far broader adoption. Their inability to adapt proves their obsolescence.  <br><br>Unions aren’t evil—they’re obsolete. Growth demands flexibility, not rigid contracts. The data is clear: unions burden economies more than they help. To unlock 21st-century growth, we must support right-to-work laws that empower individual workers, not outdated collective bargaining. Vote against unions to secure a competitive future.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and a steam judges. Today's debate has centered on whether labor unions are a net benefit to economic growth. With three core battlegrounds emerging. Productivity wage stability and adaptability. On productivity. The opposition claims unions impose unsustainable costs. Citing isolated examples like french firms. Evidence that unions enhance productivity and key sectors. Construction unions for instance achieve 22% higher output through standardized training. Illinois economic policy institute while reducing turnover costs by 30% us treasury department. The opposition's cherry-picked cases cannot override sector-specific gains that directly fuel growth. On wage stability the opposition argues higher wages harm competitiveness. Yet their own evidence admits non-union firms like amazon also offshore jobs. Proving cost pressures are industry-wide. Not union specific. Unions prevent a race to the bottom in wages sustaining the middle-class consumer demand that drives 70% of gdp us trade department. Oecd data further shows unions compress inequality by 18% ensuring growth benefits all stakeholders not just shareholders. On adaptability the opposition fixates on ridgid contract. But ignores how unions like the uaw are retraining workers for electric vehicles. Non-union firms like kodak collapsed due to rigidity while marriott posted record profits despite union contracts. Unions provide grievance systems that resolve conflicts efficiently. Proving flexibility and stability aren't mutually exclusive. At its core this debate is about what kind of growth we prioritize. The oppositions model growth at any cost has given us record gdp alongside record inequality. Unions ensure prosperity is shared as they did when building america's middle-class post 1930s.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s confront the reality: unions impose systemic costs that cripple economic growth. First, while opponents highlight construction sector productivity, they ignore the 10% profit decline in French firms from unsustainable wage hikes, as documented by *the French National Institute of Economic Studies in 2022*. Tesla’s 200% more U.S. jobs than unionized GM proves non-union models drive real growth—evidence my opponent’s cherry-picked data can’t refute.  <br><br>Second, union wage hikes backfire. Research from *the American Economic Review in 2021* shows these raises function like 33% corporate taxes, gutting investment. The 1990s tech boom—minimal unions, maximal growth—exposes their irrelevance. Singapore’s thriving economy, with no mandatory unions, further disproves their necessity. According to *a 2023 report by the Cato Institute*, artificial wage hikes inflate consumer prices by 15% and accelerate offshoring, undermining the middle class they claim to protect.  <br><br>Third, unions strangle adaptability—growth’s lifeblood. *The Harvard Business Review in 2020* detailed Marriott’s 165-day tech delays due to union resistance, while post-9/11 airline stagnation shows rigid contracts hinder crisis response. Modern safety gains come from OSHA, not collective bargaining. Even Nordic success relies on national-level flexibility—a model U.S. unions reject, as noted by *Stanford economist John Pencavel in his 2021 study on labor markets*.  <br><br>The verdict is clear: unions are relics. Growth demands right-to-work flexibility, not obsolete bargaining. Vote against unions—for jobs, innovation, and prosperity.</div>
