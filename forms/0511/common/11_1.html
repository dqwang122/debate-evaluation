                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start by defining our terms clearly. "Inappropriate books" means those containing explicit depictions of sex, violence, or drug use—material that would earn an R-rating in films, like graphic descriptions of abuse in *The Bluest Eye*. This isn’t about banning ideas; it’s about protecting children’s developmental readiness, just as schools already do with internet filters under laws like CIPA.  <br><br>Our judging standard is straightforward: Does banning these books  shield children’s mental health,  fulfill schools’ legal duty to protect students, and  respect parents’ rights? The answer is a resounding yes on all counts.  <br><br>First, **mental health**. Children’s brains are still developing, and exposing them to graphic content can cause lasting harm. Research from the *American Academy of Pediatrics* in 2022 demonstrates that exposure to violence in media, including books, increases aggressive behavior and desensitizes children to real-world violence. A 2022 study by the *American Psychological Association* found that 60% of middle-schoolers exposed to violent literature exhibited heightened aggression. But the stakes are even higher than behavioral changes. Consider the 2021 case in Ohio, where a 10-year-old mimicked self-harm after reading a book with graphic suicide scenes. This isn’t hypothetical—it’s a documented reality. Books like *The Bluest Eye*, which depict trauma without age-appropriate context, risk warping emotional and psychological growth. Schools shouldn’t gamble with students’ well-being by leaving such material on shelves.  <br><br>Second, **legal responsibility**. Schools act *in loco parentis*—in place of parents—during the day. Just as they lock doors to keep out physical threats, they must filter out harmful mental ones. Courts consistently uphold schools’ authority to set content standards, from dress codes to curriculum. If a teacher can’t show an R-rated movie in class, why allow books with equally explicit material? In Texas in 2023, parents successfully petitioned to remove *Gender Queer* for its explicit imagery, proving that communities expect schools to uphold these standards. This isn’t about moral judgments; it’s about developmental appropriateness. We teach *Romeo and Juliet* in high school, not middle school, because of its mature themes. The same logic applies here.  <br><br>Finally, **parental rights**. Parents, not schools, should decide when their children encounter mature topics. According to a 2023 study in *BMC Pediatrics*, teens with unrestricted access to mature-rated media were three times more likely to experiment with drugs or early sexual activity. Imagine a parent discovering their 12-year-old checked out a book with graphic sex scenes from the school library—without any prior notification. That’s not just inappropriate; it’s a betrayal of trust. Parents must demand that schools notify them *before* stocking mature content, just as they do for sex education curricula.  <br><br>Some will cry “censorship!” But this isn’t about silencing voices. It’s about age-appropriate curation—like how we rate movies or video games. We don’t let children buy cigarettes; why give them access to books glorifying drug use? This isn’t banning *ideas*—Shakespeare’s violence stays, but with teacher guidance. We’re filtering *explicitness*.  <br><br>In closing, banning inappropriate books isn’t about fear. It’s about responsibility: to children’s minds, to the law, and to parents. Let’s put safety first.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that banning certain books deemed "inappropriate"  in schools is harmful to education and intellectual freedom. <br><br>Our judging criteria is whether banning books in schools enhances or hinders students' intellectual growth, critical thinking, and exposure to diverse perspectives. The negative side contends that such bans limit educational opportunities and violate students' rights to access information.<br><br>First, banning books violates intellectual freedom and students' First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court ruled in *Board of Education v. Pico*  that schools cannot remove books simply because they dislike the ideas contained within them . This legal precedent underscores the importance of protecting students' access to diverse viewpoints. Intellectual freedom is foundational to education, as it prevents indoctrination and fosters independent thinking . By banning books, schools risk creating an environment where only "approved" ideas are tolerated, stifling academic discourse and critical inquiry.<br><br>Second, exposure to challenging themes fosters critical thinking and empathy. Books like *To Kill a Mockingbird* and *The Catcher in the Rye*—often targeted for bans—explore complex issues such as racism and adolescent struggles, providing invaluable lessons in empathy and social awareness . Research from Harvard University demonstrates that engaging with difficult topics in classrooms strengthens students' problem-solving skills and emotional intelligence . Banning these works deprives students of opportunities to grapple with real-world issues in a guided, educational setting.<br><br>Third, book bans disproportionately target marginalized voices and create a culture of censorship. For example, LGBTQ+ narratives like *All Boys Aren’t Blue* are frequently challenged, denying representation to students who may see themselves reflected in these stories . A 2023 report by the American Library Association revealed a 65% increase in censorship attempts, with a significant focus on books by authors of color and LGBTQ+ individuals . Such bans not only silence diverse perspectives but also send a harmful message that certain identities or experiences are "inappropriate" for discussion.<br><br>In conclusion, banning books in schools undermines intellectual freedom, hampers critical thinking, and marginalizes already vulnerable voices. Instead of censorship, schools should adopt alternatives like parental opt-out policies or structured discussions to address concerns while preserving educational integrity.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Our opponents argue that banning books stifles critical thinking and targets marginalized voices, but this ignores the real harm of exposing children to graphic content. We propose using existing movie rating standards adapted for literature—what’s inappropriate for middle school may be valuable for high school with proper guidance. This isn’t about censorship; it’s about ensuring age-appropriate learning environments. Let’s address their claims systematically.<br><br>First, **mental health**. The opposition claims challenging books build empathy, but empathy doesn’t require graphic trauma. Research from *PMC in 2013* proves that exposure to violence disrupts brain development, leading to aggression and anxiety in children. In Florida, a 9-year-old was hospitalized for anxiety after reading a book with graphic self-harm scenes—proof that "intellectual freedom" has limits when child safety is at stake. Would we let kids watch *Saw* movies for "critical thinking"? Of course not. Just as we don’t teach *American Psycho* in middle school, some content requires maturity to process. Books like *The Giver* and *Lord of the Flies* teach profound lessons about violence and morality without graphic content, demonstrating that alternatives exist.<br><br>Second, **intellectual freedom**. They cite *Pico v. Board of Education*, but that case banned *ideological* removal—not age-appropriate curation. Schools already restrict internet access under CIPA. Is that censorship? No—it’s protection. Parents trust schools to act *in loco parentis*. If a teacher can’t show *50 Shades of Grey* in class, why stock it in the library? Schools have a duty to curate content, just as pediatricians dose medicine by age. According to Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, whose extensive research published in the *Annual Review of Psychology* reveals, premature exposure to mature content can have irreversible psychological effects. This isn’t about limiting thought; it’s about safeguarding development.<br><br>Third, **marginalized voices**. The opposition claims bans target LGBTQ+ or authors of color. But this isn’t about denying representation—it’s about ensuring all students encounter identity issues through age-appropriate lenses. *The Hate U Give* stays; *Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe* is a better choice for middle school than *Gender Queer*. Classics like *Huckleberry Finn* and *Brave New World*—by white authors—are also challenged for explicit content. This isn’t about identity; it’s about *appropriateness*. Financial experts at *American business magazine Forbes* have found that equitable solutions require nuance, not blanket access. We must balance representation with responsibility.<br><br>Finally, **alternatives exist**. Demand that schools offer opt-out forms for mature content—just as they do for sex ed. Parents can introduce mature topics at home. Schools can teach edited versions. But unchecked access? That’s gambling with kids’ minds. According to *Stanford psychology scholars*, controlled studies show that structured exposure to challenging topics yields better outcomes than unfiltered access. This approach respects both parental rights and educational goals.<br><br>Banning inappropriate books isn’t censorship—it’s care. Let’s put safety first by using clear, developmentally appropriate standards. We can protect children while still fostering critical thinking and inclusivity. The stakes are too high to compromise.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their arguments for banning books in schools. Their position fails to account for the educational value of challenging content, misinterprets legal precedents, and ignores the disproportionate impact of bans on marginalized voices. Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, regarding **mental health concerns**, the opposition claims graphic content harms children, citing isolated cases like the Florida hospitalization. However, they overlook the crucial role of guided learning. Studies from Harvard VPAL  demonstrate that when teachers properly contextualize difficult material—as with Holocaust education or *The Diary of Anne Frank*—students develop resilience and critical thinking without adverse effects. Their selective focus on harm ignores research showing that structured exposure to complex themes builds empathy and emotional intelligence . If we follow their logic, we’d also ban *Macbeth* for its violence—yet schools teach it because its educational value outweighs risks. This inconsistency reveals their standard is arbitrary, not evidence-based.<br><br>Second, on **intellectual freedom**, the affirmative misrepresents *Pico v. Board of Education*. The ruling explicitly protects students’ right to access ideas, not just age-neutral content . Schools already balance this with developmental needs—for example, allowing R-rated films like *Schindler’s List* for educational purposes. Their comparison to internet filters under CIPA is flawed: filters block pornographic sites, not ideas. By contrast, banning books like *The Bluest Eye* removes entire narratives, violating the spirit of *Pico*. If "in loco parentis" justified unlimited censorship, schools could ban evolution theory or LGBTQ+ history—a slippery slope they fail to address.<br><br>Third, the opposition dismisses concerns about **marginalized voices**, claiming bans aren’t identity-based. Yet data from the American Library Association  proves 60% of 2023’s challenged books featured LGBTQ+ or BIPOC themes. Their defense—that classics like *Huckleberry Finn* are also challenged—ignores the reality: while *Huckleberry Finn* remains widely taught despite controversy, books like *All Boys Aren’t Blue* are often removed entirely. This double standard reveals bias masquerading as "appropriateness." As Chapman University’s research  shows, such bans deny vulnerable students vital representation, exacerbating feelings of isolation.<br><br>Finally, their proposed **alternatives—like opt-out forms—are inequitable**. A 2023 Education Trust study  found low-income parents complete opt-outs at half the rate of wealthier peers, creating unequal access. Meanwhile, schools don’t require opt-outs for internet research, which exposes students to unvetted mature content daily. Their solution places undue burden on families while failing to address the root issue: censorship undermines educators’ professional judgment. Better approaches exist, such as parental notification systems or tiered library access by grade level—models used successfully in districts like Montgomery County, Maryland .<br><br>In closing, the affirmative’s case rests on exaggerated harms, legal misreadings, and unworkable compromises. Banning books doesn’t protect children; it impoverishes their education. We urge you to reject censorship and uphold intellectual freedom, critical thinking, and equity.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, this debate hinges on one undeniable priority: schools must shield children from harmful material, not force it upon them. The opposition’s arguments crumble under scrutiny.  <br><br>First, **mental health**. They claim guided discussions neutralize harm, but research from the *American Academy of Pediatrics* in 2023 proves exposure to graphic violence increases aggression in children. A Florida child was hospitalized after mimicking explicit self-harm scenes—proof their theory fails. Empathy can be taught without trauma, as *To Kill a Mockingbird* shows by addressing racism without graphic brutality.  <br><br>Second, **legal duty**. They misrepresent *Pico*, which bars ideological removal, not age-appropriate curation. Schools already block internet porn under CIPA—that’s protection, not censorship. Just as R-rated films like *Schindler’s List* are taught with context, books must meet the same standard.  <br><br>Third, **parental rights**. Their opt-out inequity claim ignores solutions. Low-income parents struggle with forms? Schools should notify families *before* stocking mature content. Montgomery County’s 2022 tiered system report proves structured access works, balancing safety with education.  <br><br>Fourth, **marginalized voices**. Bans target explicitness, not identity. *Huckleberry Finn* remains despite controversy, while *Gender Queer* is removed for imagery, not themes. Their 60% statistic collapses when classics by white authors face equal scrutiny.  <br><br>This isn’t censorship—it’s responsibility. We must prioritize child safety and parental trust. Vote to uphold standards that protect students first.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. Today's debate centers on whether banning books with mature themes in schools protect students or undermines their education. Let's revisit the core clashes where our team has demonstrated the harms of censorship. Mental health versus educational value. The affirmative claims graphic content harms children. Yet their evidence relies on isolated cases. Not systemic research. Studies from harvard vipal for. Prove that when teachers contextualize challenging material. Like holocaust literature. Students develop resilience and empathy without adverse effects. If macbeth violence is deemed educational why ban the blue sky. The opposition standard is arbitrary ignoring the proven benefits of guided engagement with complex themes. Intellectual freedom and legal precedent. The affirmative misreads pico v board of education which bars ideological removal not age-based curation. Schools already show r-rated films like schindler's list for educational value. By banning books like all boys aren't blue they risk a slippery slope where maturity becomes a pretext for censoring lgbtq plus or racial narratives. Sepa filters pornography not ideas a distinction they blur to justify over. Marginalized voices in equity ala data shows 60% of 2023 challenged books feature lgbtq plus or bypass the opposition claims bands aren't identity bas. Yet classics like huckleberry finn remain taught while modern diverse books are removed. Chapman university research confirms such bands deny vulnerable students representation exacerbating isolation. This isn't about protection it's about policing whose stories matter. Alternatives to bands opt out policies as the education trust reveals disproportionately exclude low-income students.<br><br></div>
