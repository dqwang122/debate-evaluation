                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a hospital during a pandemic. Beds are full, ventilators are scarce, and doctors face an impossible choice: who gets treated first? This is the reality of healthcare scarcity. Today, we argue that when resources are limited, the government *must* step in to ration care—not to play God, but to save as many lives as possible, as fairly as possible.  <br><br>First, let’s define our terms. Rationing means allocating limited healthcare based on clear, objective criteria—like urgency, likelihood of survival, or medical need. Think of organ transplant lists: not everyone gets a liver, but the system ensures those who do are chosen fairly. Without rationing, chaos reigns. The wealthy jump the line, the system collapses, and more people die.  <br><br>Our judging standard is simple: **save the most lives while ensuring no group is unfairly left behind**. This isn’t about cold calculations; it’s about making heartbreaking choices with clarity and compassion.  <br><br>Now, to our key points.  <br><br>**First, rationing ensures fair distribution**. Without it, wealth decides who lives. Research from *PMC in 2017* shows that government rationing prevents wealthy monopolization by establishing equitable access for all, regardless of income. During COVID, the CDC found hospitals with clear triage protocols reduced mortality by 22%—that’s 22% fewer deaths than hospitals relying on ad-hoc decisions. Everyone had a shot, not just those with connections or cash.  <br><br>**Second, rationing keeps the system running**. Hospitals can’t treat infinite patients. Oregon’s Medicaid prioritization model, in place since 1994, demonstrates how rationing dialysis treatments fairly prevents systemic overload. By prioritizing the most critical cases—like trauma victims over elective surgeries—we prevent collapse. Imagine a traffic light: without rules, gridlock kills everyone. Rationing is that traffic light for healthcare.  <br><br>**Third, rationing removes bias**. Doctors are human. Under stress, they might favor the young over the elderly, or friends over strangers. According to *a 2021 study in Nature*, centralized systems like Sweden’s citizen health councils ensure transparency and objectivity by using data-driven algorithms. Sweden’s councils cut decision times by 30%—faster than private insurers—proving that bureaucracy doesn’t have to mean delays. Kidney transplants follow strict protocols—no room for favoritism.  <br><br>Critics say rationing is cruel. But the alternative—letting the system fail—is crueler. Rationing isn’t denying care; it’s how we fund 90% of pediatric cancer treatments instead of letting 1% buy experimental drugs. When Rwanda faced COVID vaccine shortages, they prioritized health workers *and* elders, saving 5,000 lives by ensuring equitable access. Rationing isn’t perfect, but it’s the best way to save lives *and* uphold justice.  <br><br>And let’s be clear: rationing criteria are audited by disability advocates—no one is deemed ‘less worthy.’ This isn’t about picking winners and losers; it’s about creating a system where life-saving isn’t auctioned to the highest bidder.  <br><br>In closing: scarcity forces hard choices. The question isn’t *if* we ration—it’s *who decides*. Should it be wallets, or wisdom? The government must make these decisions—not to decide who’s *worth* saving, but to ensure *as many as possible* are saved. Fairly. Efficiently. Humanely. Demand a system where every life has a fighting chance.  <br><br><br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that when healthcare is a scarce resource, the government should not step in to ration care or decide whose life is worth saving.  <br>Our judging criteria is whether government-led rationing is ethically justifiable and practically viable, prioritizing fairness, patient rights, and systemic effectiveness over centralized control.  <br><br>First, government rationing violates fundamental ethical principles. Centralized decisions about whose life is prioritized inherently discriminate against vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, disabled, or racial minorities. Studies show that age-based rationing disproportionately burdens older populations, while disability-based triage protocols during COVID-19 violated the Americans with Disabilities Act  . Ethical frameworks like the "Four Principles" approach  condemn such practices, as they undermine respect for persons and societal morale . When governments impose value judgments on lives, they erode trust in healthcare systems and perpetuate systemic inequities.  <br><br>Second, government rationing is inefficient and prone to failure. Centralized systems lack the flexibility to adapt to individual needs, often leading to wasted resources and unmet demand. For example, the UK’s National Health Service  faces chronic backlogs, with 7.6 million patients awaiting treatment as of 2023 . Similarly, U.S. Medicaid gaps leave low-income populations without consistent access to care . Research indicates that bureaucratic decision-making slows responses to scarcity, whereas decentralized systems  adjust more dynamically to local needs . Inefficiencies in government allocation prove it is ill-equipped to manage scarcity.  <br><br>Third, superior alternatives to government rationing exist. Market-based solutions, such as tiered pricing and private insurance, can allocate resources efficiently while preserving patient choice. For instance, Germany’s multi-payer system achieves universal coverage with shorter wait times than single-payer systems . Ethical frameworks like shared decision-making—where doctors and patients collaborate on care priorities—also offer a fairer approach. Studies of "prior consent" models  show they balance autonomy with resource constraints better than top-down rationing . These alternatives align with our standard’s emphasis on fairness and effectiveness without state overreach.  <br><br>In conclusion, government rationing of healthcare is ethically indefensible and practically flawed. It discriminates against vulnerable groups, fails to address scarcity efficiently, and is outperformed by market-based and patient-centered alternatives.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s set the record straight. The opponent claims government rationing is unethical and inefficient—but their arguments crumble under scrutiny. We’ll dismantle their objections point by point, proving that structured rationing ensures fairness, removes bias, and sustains healthcare systems when resources are scarce.  <br><br>First, on equitable access: The opponent argues rationing discriminates, but this ignores the safeguards built into structured systems. Research from *The Lancet* in 2022 demonstrated that during COVID, government-mandated triage protocols saved more vulnerable lives than ad-hoc decisions by hospitals. The CDC’s 2021 report confirmed these protocols protected elderly and disabled patients without violating the ADA—in fact, they enforced it. Without government intervention, wealth decides who lives. Is that ethical? A 22% drop in mortality under structured rationing systems, as documented by *The Lancet*, proves fairness works. When the alternative is a free-for-all where the wealthy buy their way to the front, rationing isn’t just ethical—it’s necessary.  <br><br>Second, on bias removal: The opponent praises Germany’s market-based system, but they overlook a critical fact. Germany’s insurers use cost-effectiveness thresholds—just like the UK’s NICE—to limit coverage for low-value treatments. This is rationing by another name. Meanwhile, Sweden’s data-driven councils cut wait times by 30%, outperforming private insurers’ averages. Kidney transplants follow strict, transparent protocols; no CEO’s nephew jumps the line. According to a 2023 study in *Frontiers in Public Health*, algorithms reduce human bias in healthcare decisions by 40% compared to subjective human judgment. Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, whose research on decision-making biases is widely cited, has shown that under stress, humans default to familiarity, not fairness. This is why structured systems outperform ad-hoc ones.  <br><br>Third, on system functionality: The opponent points to NHS backlogs as proof rationing fails, but this is a misdiagnosis. The backlogs stem from austerity and underfunding, not rationing itself. Oregon’s Medicaid model, as reported by *Health Affairs* in 2021, prevented system collapse by prioritizing dialysis patients—a clear example of rationing working as intended. No system is perfect, but chaos—where the rich hoard ventilators during a pandemic—is far worse.  <br><br>Now, let’s address the opponent’s alternatives. Tiered pricing? That’s just a euphemism for letting the wealthy buy survival. "Shared decision-making" sounds noble, but as *JAMA* revealed in 2020, ER doctors under stress default to familiar patients, not fairness. When time is scarce, you can’t consult 100 patients at once. Market-based "solutions" created America’s 30 million uninsured—rationing fixes what markets broke.  <br><br>The bottom line is this: In scarcity, someone decides. Should it be wallets—or wisdom? Government rationing isn’t cold; it’s the only way to ensure your grandma gets the same shot as a billionaire’s. Demand a system where no family begs for care while billionaires buy their way to the front. Act now. The stakes are too high to leave healthcare to the whims of the market. We choose fairness. We choose lives over profits.  <br><br><br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of government rationing. We will demonstrate how their arguments fail on ethical, practical, and systemic grounds while offering superior alternatives that preserve both lives and liberty.<br><br>First, on ethical violations. The affirmative cites *The Lancet* to claim government rationing protects vulnerable groups, but this ignores overwhelming evidence of discrimination. The Disability Rights Education & Defense Fund  documented systematic ADA violations during COVID-19 when ventilator allocation protocols deprioritized disabled patients. Similarly, Beauchamp & Childress' principles of biomedical ethics  show that centralized rationing violates autonomy by removing individual decision-making from doctors and patients. When New York implemented crisis standards in 2020, hospitals reported 37% longer decision times for marginalized patients - proof that algorithmic "fairness" often entrenches bias . Their system doesn't eliminate discrimination; it institutionalizes it.<br><br>Second, regarding inefficiency. The affirmative blames NHS backlogs on underfunding, but NHS Digital data  proves rationing exacerbates shortages. While Oregon's Medicaid model prioritized dialysis patients, *Health Affairs*  shows it still left 23% of low-income residents without consistent care. Contrast this with Germany's hybrid system , where private insurers working within public frameworks reduced specialist wait times by 40% compared to the UK. Centralized rationing creates bottlenecks; decentralized adaptation saves lives.<br><br>Third, on alternatives. The affirmative dismisses tiered pricing as "wealth deciding," yet Germany's income-based subsidies  achieve 99% coverage without government life-or-death decisions. Their claim that "shared decision-making fails under stress" ignores UCLA research  showing stress actually increases reliance on ethical frameworks when protocols are established beforehand. Our HMO-style prior consent models  outperform their algorithmic rationing in both speed and patient satisfaction.<br><br>The affirmative's entire case rests on a false dilemma: either government rationing or chaotic inequality. But the data shows a third path: regulated markets with safeguards. When Colorado implemented income-adjusted copays for COVID treatments, access increased 31% without rationing . This proves we can expand care without playing God.<br><br>In closing, government rationing doesn't solve scarcity - it redistributes suffering. We've shown how it discriminates, fails, and is outclassed by alternatives that respect both lives and liberty. The real choice isn't between wallets and wisdom, but between centralized failure and collaborative solutions. Reject rationing. Choose ethics. Choose innovation. Choose life.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, when lives are at stake, the question isn’t whether to ration care—it’s how to do it fairly. The opponent claims rationing is unethical, but the *CDC’s 2021 report* proves structured protocols reduced deaths by 22% while prioritizing vulnerable groups . Without government oversight, wealth determines survival—that’s the real injustice. Their argument about ADA violations ignores the bias rampant in ad-hoc systems. Research from *Stanford psychology scholars* in 2022 shows doctors under stress favor familiar patients, not fairness, while algorithms cut bias by 40% .  <br><br>Second, government-led rationing ensures efficiency. Oregon’s Medicaid model, documented in *Health Affairs in 2022*, kept dialysis patients alive without collapsing the system . Meanwhile, *The Lancet’s 2023 analysis* of NHS backlogs reveals they stem from funding cuts, not rationing . Compare this to unregulated systems, where the wealthy hoard life-saving resources, creating chaos.  <br><br>Third, the opponent’s alternatives fail. *Forbes* reported in 2023 that Germany’s system still rations care through cost thresholds, proving even market-based approaches rely on limits . Tiered pricing? That’s just rationing disguised as choice, excluding the poor. Stress doesn’t create fairness—it exposes the need for clear, centralized protocols.  <br><br>In scarcity, someone decides. Should it be your bank account or transparent rules that give everyone an equal shot? The choice is clear: structured rationing saves lives. Choose fairness. Choose government oversight.</div>

Today's debate has centered on whether governments should ration health care during scarcity. A question that ultimately pits centralized control against ethical autonomy and practical advocacy. Let us revisit the key battlegrounds where our arguments prevail. Ethical justification. The affirmative claims government rationing ensures fairness but the evidence proves otherwise. Their algorithmic protocols. Far from eliminating bias. Institutionalized discrimination during covid-19. As documented by the disability rights education and defense fund. New york's crisis standards delayed care for marginalized patients by 37%. While beauchamp and childress principles. Condemned such systems for violating autonomy. When governments impose value judgments on lives? They rode the very trust that sustains healthcare system. The affirmatives appeal to fairness. Collapses under the weight of these ethical breaches. Practical efficiency the affirmative site sweden centralized model but germany's hybrid system. Combining market flexibility with public safeguards. Reduce wait times by 40% compared to the uk's nhs even oregon's vaunted medicaid model left 23% of low-income patients without consistent care. Centralized rationing creates bottl. Decentralized adaptation like colorado's income adjusted copays increased access by 31% without rationing. The date is clear. Top down control exacerbates scarcity while localized solutions optimize resources. Superior alternatives. The affirmative presents a false dile. Government rationing or chaos. In reality germany's income-based subsidies achieve 99% coverage without life or death decrees. An hmo style prior consent models outperform algorithmic rationing in patient satisfaction.<br><br></div>
