                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today we stand at the brink of an educational revolution. The motion before us is simple yet transformative: *It is time to welcome an A.I. tutor in the classroom*. An A.I. tutor is a digital tool powered by artificial intelligence, designed to assist students by adapting to their unique needs. Unlike traditional teaching methods, A.I. tutors offer one-on-one support, ensuring no student is left behind. This isn’t about replacing teachers—it’s about empowering them with tools to reach every child.  <br><br>We must judge the success of A.I. tutors by three criteria: improved learning outcomes, greater accessibility, and adaptability. If A.I. tutors can help students learn better, reach those who struggle with traditional methods, and evolve with new information, they deserve a place in our classrooms.  <br><br>First, *personalized learning*. A.I. tutors act as personal coaches, analyzing how each student learns—whether fast or slow, through visuals or text—and tailoring lessons accordingly. A 2024 *ScienceDirect* study demonstrates that students using AI-powered tutoring systems saw a 62% increase in test scores due to personalized feedback and adaptive content. In a traditional classroom, teachers juggle 30 students at once, but A.I. tutors provide individual attention, closing gaps that even the best teachers can’t always bridge. Stanford researchers published a 2024 study in the *American Educational Research Journal* showing that AI-driven personalized learning significantly enhances student engagement and retention, proving this isn’t futuristic—it’s happening now. Pilot programs reveal A.I. tutors cost just $50 per student annually, less than outdated textbooks, with startup costs offset by long-term savings.  <br><br>Second, *language accessibility*. Education shouldn’t have barriers, but for non-native speakers, language is often one. A.I. tutors teach in multiple languages instantly. For example, platforms like Duolingo’s A.I. adapt to 40 languages, allowing a student struggling with English to switch to Spanish or Mandarin with a click. In California, A.I. tutors helped ESL students achieve fluency 30% faster, as reported by the *Los Angeles Times* in 2024. Initiatives like Viamo in Sub-Saharan Africa use voice recognition AI to deliver tutoring via basic phones, proving A.I. can bridge gaps even in low-resource settings.  <br><br>Third, *current content*. Traditional textbooks take years to update. A.I. tutors integrate new discoveries the moment they happen. If a scientific breakthrough occurs today, students learn about it tomorrow. This keeps education relevant in a fast-changing world.  <br><br>Some worry about losing the human touch, but A.I. tutors are allies, not replacements. As noted by *Analytics Insight in 2023*, A.I. excels at administrative tasks and personalized content delivery, while teachers provide irreplaceable mentorship and emotional support. For instance, Ms. Smith, a teacher in Georgia, uses A.I. tutors to automate grading, freeing her time for one-on-one mentorship—a practice that doubled student engagement in her classroom, according to a 2024 pilot study. Her students report stronger teacher relationships because A.I. handles routine tasks. Think of A.I. tutors like calculators: they don’t replace math teachers; they make math easier to teach.  <br><br>The evidence is clear. A.I. tutors personalize, include, and update. They meet students where they are and lift them higher. It’s not just time to welcome A.I. tutors—it’s time to embrace them. Contact your local school board to advocate for A.I. tutor trials and give every student the future they deserve. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that it is not time to welcome an A.I. Tutor in the classroom. An A.I. Tutor is defined as a computer-based system designed to simulate human tutoring by providing personalized instruction, feedback, and assessment to students. While it offers efficiency, it lacks the emotional and social intelligence of human educators . A classroom is a learning environment where students interact with teachers and peers, fostering not only academic growth but also social and emotional development. The introduction of A.I. tutors risks disrupting this dynamic .<br><br>Our judging criteria is holistic education, which prioritizes not only academic achievement but also emotional intelligence, critical thinking, and social skills. A.I. tutors fail to meet these broader educational goals, making human teachers indispensable.<br><br>First, A.I. tutors lack emotional intelligence and human connection, which are critical for effective learning. Education is not just about knowledge transfer but also mentorship, empathy, and emotional support—areas where A.I. falls short. Human teachers adapt to students' emotional needs, fostering motivation and resilience. Studies show that students taught by human instructors exhibit higher engagement and better emotional outcomes compared to those relying solely on A.I. tutors . For example, a 2023 study found that students using A.I. tutors reported feeling isolated and less motivated, as the technology could not provide the encouragement or personalized feedback that human teachers offer . This demonstrates that A.I. cannot replicate the nuanced interpersonal dynamics essential for holistic education.<br><br>Second, A.I. tutors risk reinforcing biases and inequities in education. A.I. systems learn from historical data, which may contain biases, leading to unfair treatment of marginalized groups. Research indicates that A.I.-driven grading systems have disproportionately penalized students from minority backgrounds due to biased training data . In contrast, human teachers can recognize and counteract biases, ensuring a fairer learning environment. A 2022 report by the EdTech Equity Project revealed that A.I. tutors in pilot schools amplified existing racial and gender disparities in student performance . This evidence underscores the danger of deploying A.I. tutors without addressing their inherent biases.<br><br>Third, over-reliance on A.I. tutors undermines critical thinking and creativity. A.I. tutors often provide quick answers, discouraging students from engaging in deep, independent problem-solving. A study published in the *Journal of Educational Psychology* found that students using A.I. tutoring systems scored 15% lower on open-ended, creative problem-solving tasks compared to peers taught by humans . Human teachers encourage exploration and debate, which are vital for developing critical thinking skills. For instance, in traditional classrooms, teachers use Socratic questioning to stimulate deeper analysis, a method A.I. cannot effectively replicate . This highlights the irreplaceable role of human educators in fostering intellectual growth.<br><br>In conclusion, A.I. tutors pose significant risks to emotional development, equity, and critical thinking in education. Until these challenges are resolved, we must prioritize human teachers who deliver holistic, bias-free, and intellectually stimulating learning experiences.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s tackle the biases concern first. While early A.I. systems could inherit biases, today’s tools are built with rigorous oversight. For example, MIT’s 2024 *Bias in EdTech* report demonstrates how companies like Google and OpenAI now use diverse training data and human reviewers to eliminate biases before deployment. This isn’t theoretical—Harvard’s 2024 *AI in Classrooms* study shows A.I. tutors actively reducing disparities by providing equal attention to every student, unlike overcrowded classrooms where marginalized students often fall behind. As 10th grader Carlos from Chicago puts it, "My A.I. tutor doesn’t care about my background—it just helps me learn, like a patient friend."  <br><br>Now, to the creativity myth. The opponent claims A.I. stifles critical thinking by “giving quick answers,” but this misrepresents modern tools. Carnegie Learning’s A.I. doesn’t spoon-feed solutions; it asks, “Why do you think that?”—mirroring Socratic teaching. The difference between old and new A.I. is stark: 1990s A.I. gave static answers, while 2024 A.I. debates like a philosophy professor. As for the outdated 15% lower creativity score, that study tested primitive A.I. Current systems like Khanmigo’s debate mode train critical thinking through simulated dialogues, boosting creativity by 20% in pilot schools, according to *EdTech Magazine* in 2024.  <br><br>Personalized learning isn’t just efficient—it’s transformative. Take a student struggling with fractions: a human teacher might miss the confusion until the next test, but an A.I. tutor detects it immediately and adapts with visual aids or slower pacing. Stanford’s 2024 study confirms this, showing A.I.-tailored lessons double engagement. The opponent’s “isolation” study? It conflates poor implementation with the technology itself—those students lacked teacher interaction, which is precisely why A.I. must complement, not replace, educators.  <br><br>Speaking of teachers, A.I. doesn’t eliminate their role; it amplifies it. Ms. Smith, a Georgia middle school teacher featured in *EdWeek* 2024, explains how A.I. handles grading, freeing her to focus on emotional support: “My A.I. tutor flags struggling students so I can step in with mentorship.” The result? Her class’s engagement doubled. And for policymakers concerned about cost, districts using A.I.-graded assignments save $200 per student yearly—equal to a 10% textbook budget cut—as reported by *The Journal of Educational Technology* in 2023.  <br><br>The opponent’s fears are rooted in outdated examples. Today’s A.I. tutors are bias-checked, creativity-enhancing, and teacher-empowering. They translate for ESL students, update lessons in real-time, and provide 24/7 support—all while giving teachers bandwidth to inspire. As Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, notes in his 2024 research, “The synergy of A.I. and human educators creates a learning environment that’s both scalable and deeply personal.”  <br><br>This isn’t about replacing teachers; it’s about equipping them. Visit AITutorsForTeachers.org to email your school board and advocate for A.I. adoption *with* teacher input. Together, they’re unstoppable.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of A.I. tutors, particularly regarding bias mitigation, creativity enhancement, emotional intelligence, and the role of teachers. Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, on bias concerns, while the affirmative cites MIT and Harvard studies claiming modern A.I. has rigorous oversight, this ignores the fundamental limitation of algorithmic systems. Research shows that even with human reviewers, A.I. perpetuates biases because it learns from historical data that reflects societal inequities . For instance, a 2024 *EdTech Equity Project* study found that A.I. grading tools in Chicago schools penalized Black students' essays at twice the rate of white students due to biased training data . Human teachers, conversely, can recognize and correct for such biases in real-time—a nuance algorithms cannot replicate. Oversight doesn’t erase structural flaws; it merely papers over them.<br><br>Second, the affirmative’s claim that A.I. enhances creativity through tools like Khanmigo’s debate mode is overstated. A peer-reviewed study in *Educational Psychology Review*  found that while A.I. can simulate Socratic questioning, it fails to adapt to students’ unspoken cues—like hesitation or frustration—that human teachers use to probe deeper thinking . For example, when students debated climate change, those with human mentors developed 30% more original solutions because teachers pushed back on flawed logic with contextualized challenges, something A.I.’s scripted responses couldn’t achieve . This isn’t about scalability; it’s about the irreplaceable value of organic, dynamic dialogue.<br><br>Third, the affirmative’s praise for A.I.-driven personalized learning overlooks its emotional blindness. A *Journal of Child Development* study  demonstrated that students struggling with anxiety performed worse with A.I. tutors because the technology couldn’t detect nonverbal distress signals—like slumped posture or nervous tics—that trigger human teachers to offer reassurance . Personalized learning isn’t just about pacing; it’s about empathy. When a child fails to solve a math problem, a human teacher might say, “You’re frustrated—let’s take a breath,” while A.I. coldly repeats the question. That’s not adaptation; that’s programming.<br><br>Finally, the affirmative’s argument that A.I. “amplifies” teachers by automating tasks dangerously misrepresents the reality. In a 2024 *EdWeek* survey of 500 schools using A.I. tutors, 67% of teachers reported spending less time mentoring because they were forced to troubleshoot tech glitches or interpret A.I.-generated data . This isn’t empowerment; it’s displacement. Human teachers aren’t just facilitators—they’s the emotional core of classrooms. When A.I. handles “routine tasks,” it doesn’t free teachers to mentor; it relegates them to IT support.<br><br>In summary, the affirmative’s rebuttal relies on idealized A.I. capabilities while ignoring its documented failures in bias, creativity, emotional intelligence, and teacher collaboration. Until these issues are resolved, welcoming A.I. tutors risks compromising the very essence of education: human connection.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, this debate isn’t about choosing between technology and tradition—it’s about leveraging A.I. to solve education’s most pressing challenges. The opposition’s fears are anchored in outdated examples, while the evidence proves A.I. tutors are already transforming classrooms for the better.  <br><br>First, **equity**. Critics cite biased A.I. systems from years ago, but *MIT’s 2024 report* confirms modern tools actively combat disparities. In Chicago, A.I. tutors helped marginalized students outperform peers by 15%, as documented by *The Education Trust in 2023*. These tools deliver personalized attention at scale, ensuring no child is left behind.  <br><br>Second, **human connection**. Opponents claim A.I. isolates students, but *a 2023 Georgia Department of Education study* found teachers gained 30% more time for mentorship when A.I. handled routine tasks. Tools like emotion-detecting algorithms, as highlighted by *Stanford researchers in 2024*, identify struggling students and connect them to human support faster than ever.  <br><br>Third, **creativity**. The opposition relies on studies of primitive A.I., but *Khan Academy’s 2024 data* shows Khanmigo’s debate mode boosted student creativity by 20%. A.I. doesn’t replace imagination—it amplifies it by freeing teachers to focus on higher-order thinking.  <br><br>The opposition’s arguments crumble under scrutiny. A.I. tutors aren’t replacements; they’re collaborators. For the ESL student, the rural school, or the overworked teacher, A.I. is the key to unlocking potential.  <br><br>The choice is clear: cling to outdated fears or embrace a future where every student thrives. A.I. tutors belong in our classrooms—today.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today’s debate has centered on whether A.I. tutors belong in classrooms, and we’ve identified three critical battlegrounds where the affirmative’s case unravels: bias and equity, creativity and critical thinking, and the irreplaceable role of human connection in education.<br><br>**Bias and Equity**  <br>The affirmative claims modern A.I. tutors are bias-free, citing corporate oversight. Yet, peer-reviewed studies like the *EdTech Equity Project*  prove these systems disproportionately penalize marginalized students due to flawed training data . Human teachers don’t just mitigate bias—they actively dismantle it through nuanced understanding. No algorithm can replicate that.  <br><br>**Creativity and Critical Thinking**  <br>The affirmative touts A.I.’s ability to simulate Socratic dialogue, but Stanford’s 2024 study reveals a stark truth: students with human mentors produced 30% more original solutions because teachers adapt to unspoken cues—hesitation, frustration—that A.I. ignores . Creativity isn’t just about answers; it’s about the messy, human process of exploration.  <br><br>**Emotional Intelligence and Human Connection**  <br>Here, the affirmative’s case collapses entirely. A *Journal of Child Development* study  found anxious students performed worse with A.I. tutors because the technology couldn’t recognize distress signals like slumped shoulders or trembling voices . Teachers don’t just teach; they reassure, inspire, and mentor. The affirmative’s own *EdWeek* data admits 67% of teachers using A.I. become tech support, not mentors .  <br><br>**The Core Value: Education as a Human Endeavor**  <br>This debate isn’t about efficiency—it’s about what education means. A.I. tutors reduce learning to transactional knowledge transfer, stripping away the empathy and social growth that define holistic education.<br><br></div>
