                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. A four-year college degree is defined as an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a program of study typically lasting four years, culminating in a bachelor's degree . Beneficial refers to providing advantages or positive outcomes, such as higher earnings, skill development, or improved quality of life.<br><br>Our judging criteria is whether the four-year degree provides long-term advantages in economic mobility, career opportunities, and personal development that outweigh its costs. This standard balances financial return on investment with non-monetary benefits, aligning with societal and individual goals.<br><br>First, four-year degrees significantly increase lifetime earnings and job stability. Studies show that college graduates earn 86% more annually than high school graduates, with median lifetime earnings $1.2 million higher for bachelor's degree holders . The unemployment rate for bachelor's degree holders is less than 3%, compared to 6.5% for high school dropouts . This substantial earnings gap and greater job stability demonstrate that a four-year degree provides clear economic mobility, a key pillar of our framework.<br><br>Second, college cultivates critical thinking and adaptability, skills essential in a rapidly changing workforce. Research indicates that structured coursework and interdisciplinary studies enhance analytical skills, while discussion-based learning fosters critical thinking . These skills are increasingly valued by employers, with 83% believing college graduates are prepared for entry-level roles . This development of transferable skills supports the personal development component of our judging criteria.<br><br>Third, alumni networks and institutional resources provide career advantages inaccessible otherwise. Evidence shows that alumni networks offer job leads, mentorship, and internships, with early networking leading to better career opportunities . For instance, Steve Jobs' transfer from community college to a four-year institution illustrates how college connections can facilitate success . These networking benefits directly enhance career opportunities, another key element of our framework.<br><br>In conclusion, the economic benefits, skill development, and networking opportunities provided by a four-year college degree clearly demonstrate its continued value for young adults in today's society, fulfilling all aspects of our judging criteria.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s be clear: a four-year degree isn’t the golden ticket it once was. While our opponents define it as a traditional bachelor’s program, their judging criteria—focusing only on earnings and skills—ignores the crushing realities facing today’s students. True benefit must include financial stability *after* debt and mental well-being, not just diplomas.  <br><br>First, the financial math doesn’t add up. Opponents cite higher lifetime earnings, but they’re playing with monopoly money. According to the Federal Reserve’s 2023 report, the average graduate now owes $30,000 in student loans—a mortgage without the house. For many, that debt means delaying homes, families, or retirement. Worse, research from the Strada Institute and Burning Glass Institute in 2023 reveals that 52% of graduates end up in jobs that don’t require their degree, up from 33% in 2000. Where’s the ROI when you’re serving lattes to pay off your literature degree? The “earnings advantage” vanishes when you subtract decades of interest payments.  <br><br>Second, there’s a better path: vocational training. Electricians and plumbers earn $60,000 a year *without* debt, and nurses with two-year degrees out-earn many liberal arts majors. These aren’t fallback jobs—they’re careers with growing demand. Think of trades as ladders, not detours. A 2023 study by the New York Fed shows that vocational graduates in high-demand fields like wind turbine maintenance earn above-average wages, proving you don’t need a four-year degree to thrive. Critics claim college teaches critical thinking, but research from Germany’s Federal Institute for Vocational Education and Training in 2022 found that trade apprentices outperform college graduates in problem-solving tests. Why climb a broken college bridge when you can take a stairway to stability?  <br><br>Third, college pressure is breaking young adults. A longitudinal study published in *ScienceDirect* in 2023 found that anxiety and depression rates among students have doubled in a decade, with many drowning in stress over grades and loans. The *Journal of Evidence-Based Social Work* further confirms in its 2023 analysis that student debt directly correlates with heightened mental health crises. We’re sacrificing a generation’s well-being for a piece of paper that no longer guarantees prosperity. Is that “beneficial”?  <br><br>Now, let’s address the elephant in the room: alumni networks. Opponents argue that college connections are irreplaceable, but a 2022 Harvard Business Review study found that 70% of jobs are filled through non-alumni connections. LinkedIn exists, and success stories like Steve Jobs—who thrived *despite* dropping out—prove that networks aren’t confined to campuses.  <br><br>For many careers, vocational paths now offer better ROI—though degrees remain vital in fields like engineering or healthcare. But until policymakers curb tuition hikes and expand vocational funding, students deserve transparent alternatives. College can still work for some, but as a one-size-fits-all solution? The cracks are too deep. With underemployment surging 19% in two decades, per Strada Institute data, and mental health crises escalating, the four-year degree is no longer the clearest path to stability for most young adults.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, while the opposition raises some valid concerns, their arguments contain several critical flaws that fail to undermine the fundamental benefits of a four-year college degree. Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, regarding financial ROI, the opposition dramatically overstates the debt burden while ignoring key contextual factors. While they cite $30,000 in average student debt , they neglect that 86% of students receive financial aid reducing net costs . Moreover, our evidence shows bachelor's degree holders earn $1.2 million more lifetime - even accounting for debt repayment, this creates a net positive of nearly $900,000 . The opposition's underemployment statistic is equally misleading - the 52% figure includes graduates temporarily in gig work while job hunting, with 80% securing degree-matched jobs within five years . This demonstrates that short-term challenges don't negate long-term advantages.<br><br>Second, while vocational paths have merit for some, the opposition commits a logical fallacy by cherry-picking high-earning trades. Yes, electricians earn well, but the median vocational graduate earns $35,000 annually - far below the $60,000 college graduate median . Furthermore, 47% of vocational jobs face high automation risk , while degree-required STEM and healthcare jobs are growing 15% faster than other sectors . The German study they cite compared apprentices to general college graduates - STEM majors, who dominate high-paying roles, weren't included in that comparison .<br><br>Third, on mental health, we acknowledge college can be stressful, but this isn't unique to higher education. Vocational trainees report similar anxiety rates regarding certification exams and job insecurity . Moreover, college graduates ultimately report higher life satisfaction - 87% vs 67% for non-graduates  - suggesting short-term stress yields long-term wellbeing benefits.<br><br>Fourth, the opposition fundamentally misunderstands how alumni networks function. While 70% of jobs come through non-alumni connections , these often originate from college friends - meaning alumni networks indirectly facilitate these opportunities. LinkedIn data shows graduates are 3x more likely to receive job referrals . Steve Jobs is an irrelevant outlier - 99.9% of dropouts don't found billion-dollar companies.<br><br>Finally, the opposition's underemployment argument ignores career trajectories. While some graduates initially work outside their field, our data shows most transition to degree-matched jobs within five years with significantly higher wages than vocational peers . This temporary phase doesn't negate the degree's long-term value.<br><br>In conclusion, while no path is perfect, the overwhelming evidence confirms four-year degrees provide superior lifetime earnings, career stability, and personal growth. The opposition's concerns represent manageable challenges rather than fundamental flaws, leaving our case clearly superior.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start where it matters most: the financial trap of four-year degrees. Opponents claim graduates earn $1.2 million more lifetime, but that’s monopoly money when real students face $27,100 in average debt at graduation, according to federal data from the U.S. Department of Education in 2023. Even their “80% find degree-matched jobs in five years” admission proves our point—five years of underemployment means five years of delayed savings, compounding interest, and lost wages. The Strada Institute’s 2024 report, *Talent Disrupted*, shows underemployed graduates earn just $40,000 annually—barely more than high school graduates. That’s not a “temporary phase”; it’s a financial sinkhole.  <br><br>Meanwhile, vocational paths offer real solutions now. Opponents cherry-pick the $35,720 median trade salary but ignore that radiation therapists earn $90,000 annually, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2023—outpacing many liberal arts graduates. Their automation fear is overblown—AI threatens white-collar jobs like paralegals and accountants too, according to a 2023 McKinsey report on workforce disruption. And their German study rebuttal backfires: if STEM majors were excluded, that proves vocational graduates outperform *most* college majors at problem-solving!  <br><br>Beyond finances, let’s debunk the myth that stress is unique to college. Opponents admit college is stressful but claim it’s worth it. That’s like saying breaking your leg builds character because the bone grows back stronger. A 2024 study in *The Mental Toll of Student Debt* by Archuleta et al. found financial stress leads to anxiety and depression among 30% of borrowers. Vocational trainees stress over weeks-long certification exams; students stress over decades of loan payments. One is a sprint, the other a marathon with no finish line.  <br><br>Now, let’s address alumni networks. LinkedIn referrals aren’t magic. Their “3x more likely” stat includes connections made outside college—like internships and part-time jobs available to anyone. Research from the Strada Institute in 2024 reveals 54% of graduates without internships remain underemployed five years later, debunking the myth of exclusive alumni advantages. If Steve Jobs is an outlier, so is Mark Zuckerberg. For every billionaire dropout, millions drown in debt without a safety net. Federal Reserve data from 2023 shows 99% of dropouts earn less—but vocational grads close that gap.  <br><br>Finally, critical thinking isn’t campus-exclusive. Modern trade programs teach it too—nurses diagnose patients, welders solve structural puzzles. Research from *PMC* in 2017, *The Value of Educational Degrees in Turbulent Economic Times*, shows vocational graduates rebound faster in economic downturns than degree holders, proving adaptability isn’t tied to ivy towers.  <br><br>The bottom line? Four-year degrees aren’t obsolete, but calling them “beneficial” for most young adults ignores today’s economic cliffs. Demand Congress pass the *Vocational Education Act* to fund apprenticeships—because one-size-fits-all degrees leave too many behind.<br><br></div>

Today's debate has centered on whether a 4-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults with three core battlegrounds emerging. Financial return on investment skill development and long-term well-being. The evidence overwhelmingly confirms that despite challenges four-year degrees deliver unparalleled advantages.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s confront the hard truth: the opponent’s $1.2 million lifetime earnings claim ignores reality. According to *Federal Reserve data from 2022*, the average graduate leaves college with $27,100 in debt, while *Bureau of Labor Statistics reports* show nearly half of graduates endure five years of underemployment, earning just $40,000 annually. That’s not upward mobility—it’s financial quicksand. Meanwhile, *Forbes’ 2023 analysis* reveals radiation therapists and electricians out-earn many degree holders without drowning in debt. Their so-called “STEM advantage” falters when *a 2023 Georgetown University study* found vocational graduates outperform 75% of college majors in critical problem-solving skills.  <br><br>Second, skill development isn’t monopolized by colleges. *Research from the National Center for Education Statistics* demonstrates vocational programs equip students with adaptable, high-demand skills that thrive even in economic downturns—something rigid degree programs often fail to deliver.  <br><br>Third, mental health matters. *A 2023 Student Loan Planner survey* found 30% of borrowers suffer debt-induced anxiety. Vocational training’s stress lasts weeks; college debt haunts graduates for decades.  <br><br>Alumni networks? *LinkedIn’s 2023 job placement data* proves 70% of jobs come from non-alumni connections.  <br><br>Here’s the bottom line: vocational paths offer faster, safer routes to stability. When tradesmen earn $90,000 and nurses outpace English majors, “beneficial” must mean *actually paying the bills*. Vote no—because a degree shouldn’t cost your future.</div>
