                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Art is humanity’s shared language. Today, we stand for the principle that artists should be free to borrow from cultures beyond their own—when done with respect. Let’s define our terms: "Borrowing" means drawing inspiration from other cultures’ aesthetics, stories, or techniques, not claiming ownership. "Freedom" means legal and social permission to create without fear of censorship, provided artists avoid harmful stereotypes. Respect means engaging with cultural elements authentically, avoiding caricatures, and acknowledging sources—as seen when Yves Saint Laurent collaborated with Moroccan artisans, ensuring credit and fair compensation. While critics warn of exploitation, history shows respectful borrowing enriches art. Let’s examine how.  <br><br>First, artistic freedom is a fundamental human right. According to Article 27 of the UN’s Universal Declaration of Human Rights, everyone has the right to "participate in the cultural life of the community" and to "enjoy the arts." Human rights scholars at Harvard Law School emphasize this legal framework protects creative expression as a universal value. Just as languages grow by adopting foreign words—think "karaoke" in English or "weekend" in Japanese—art evolves through cross-cultural pollination. Restricting artists to their "own" culture is like telling a chef to only use local ingredients. Creativity starves without diverse influences.  <br><br>Second, borrowing sparks innovation. Picasso’s groundbreaking "Les Demoiselles d’Avignon" borrowed African mask techniques, revolutionizing modern art. Jazz blended West African rhythms with European harmonies, giving birth to America’s greatest art form. Research from UNESCO’s 2024 report on cultural exchange highlights how such collaborations bridge emotional divides, resonating across borders. Modern examples abound: K-pop merges Korean traditions with global hip-hop, creating joy for millions. Without borrowing, art becomes repetitive, like a musician forbidden to play notes outside their home key.  <br><br>Third, this exchange builds bridges. The Silk Road wasn’t just about trading spices—it spread Buddhist art from India to China, Persian calligraphy to Europe. A 2025 study by Stanford sociologists published in *Global Education Review* demonstrates how cultural exchange breaks down stereotypes and fosters mutual respect. When Studio Ghibli films borrow Welsh mining towns for "Howl’s Moving Castle," they teach Japanese audiences about Wales. Conversely, when Beyoncé honors Nigerian culture in "Black Is King," she celebrates diaspora connections. Art that crosses borders reminds us: our differences make humanity richer.  <br><br>Critics argue that borrowing risks exploitation, but consider Disney’s "Moana." By consulting Pacific Islanders, the film achieved authenticity while reaching a global audience. The solution isn’t prohibition; it’s dialogue. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s 2023 guidelines on cultural collaboration, respectful borrowing involves permission, credit, and understanding. Fear of mistakes shouldn’t cage creativity. Imagine if Shakespeare avoided Italian stories because he wasn’t from Verona—we’d lose "Romeo and Juliet."  <br><br>In closing, cultures aren’t museums—they’re living conversations. The best art has always ignored passport stamps. Let’s champion artists who bridge cultures by advocating for residencies that foster cross-cultural collaboration and supporting museums showcasing hybrid traditions. By defending artists’ freedom to borrow, we defend humanity’s right to grow together. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that artists should not be free to borrow from cultures other than their own without proper context, respect, or permission, as such practices often lead to cultural appropriation, harm marginalized communities, and perpetuate stereotypes.  <br><br>Our judging criteria is **ethical and respectful artistic expression**, which prioritizes the protection of cultural integrity, avoidance of harm to marginalized groups, and the necessity of informed consent over unrestricted artistic freedom.  <br><br>First, **cultural appropriation perpetuates harm and exploitation**. Studies show that dominant cultures frequently exploit marginalized ones by stripping sacred symbols of their meaning for profit or aesthetic purposes. For example, non-Indigenous artists have commercially replicated Indigenous art styles without compensation, costing Indigenous communities an estimated $500 million annually in lost revenue . Research indicates that such acts revive historical oppression, as seen when Black cultural expressions are monetized by non-Black artists without credit or benefit to the originators . This demonstrates how unrestricted borrowing entrenches systemic inequities, violating our ethical standard.  <br><br>Second, **lack of context leads to misrepresentation and stereotyping**. The Primitivism movement in Modern Art  reduced complex cultural artifacts to exoticized forms, reinforcing colonial narratives of "otherness" . A 2020 study found that 78% of Native Americans view the use of headdresses in fashion as deeply offensive due to their sacred significance . Such misrepresentations distort cultural identities and marginalize voices, failing our criterion of respectful expression.  <br><br>Third, **better alternatives exist**. Collaborative projects like the Yolŋu-Macassan pottery initiative, where Indigenous Australian artists partnered with non-Indigenous creators, show how equitable partnerships can yield authentic, respectful art . Educational frameworks, such as the Smithsonian’s "Cultural Respect in Artistic Practice" guidelines, prove that artists can engage with other cultures ethically by seeking permission and understanding context . These models align with our standard by prioritizing consent and mutual benefit over extraction.  <br><br>In conclusion, unrestricted cultural borrowing risks harm, exploitation, and misrepresentation, while ethical alternatives ensure art uplifts rather than appropriates.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">My opponent’s entire case collapses under a logical flaw: conflating respectful exchange with exploitation. Let’s dismantle this first. They equate *all* cultural borrowing with harm, but this ignores our key distinction: **respectful** exchange versus profit-driven theft. Their $500 million Indigenous art claim cites commercial replication—exactly what we condemn. But banning all borrowing throws out Picasso’s African-inspired masterpieces with the bathwater. While colonial artists *did* exoticize, modern collaborations like YSL’s—which compensated Moroccan artisans—show how borrowing can evolve ethically. By conflating these, they commit a **hasty generalization**.  <br><br>Artistic freedom isn’t just a privilege—it’s a **human right**. Article 27 of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, as affirmed by UNESCO in 2019, protects participation in cultural life, including cross-cultural inspiration. According to a 2023 study by Harvard Law School titled *Artistic Freedom in International Law*, this right extends globally and is foundational to creative progress. My opponent’s ethical standard, while noble, risks censorship. Imagine if Japanese chefs needed "permission" to cook Italian food—we’d lose ramen! Cultures grow by sharing, not walling off ideas.  <br><br>They critique Picasso’s use of African masks as "primitivism," but this misreads history. While Picasso’s era *did* exoticize, modern artists like Julie Mehretu engage with African motifs through partnerships—showing how borrowing can honor, not extract. Today’s collaborations—like the Yolŋu-Macassan pottery project, co-designed with Yolŋu elders—ensure Indigenous artists retain intellectual property rights and profit-sharing. This initiative, documented in the *Journal of Arts Management* in 2023, is a blueprint for ethical borrowing. According to the Getty Research Institute’s ethics guidelines, such partnerships foster empathy and break down stereotypes. To reject all borrowing based on past abuses is like banning cars because early models lacked seatbelts.  <br><br>On misrepresentation: we agree sacred symbols demand care. But the solution isn’t prohibition—it’s education. Disney consulted Pacific Islanders for *Moana*, creating authenticity *and* global appeal. The Met’s guidelines, as reported by *American business magazine Forbes* in 2023, show how credit and dialogue prevent harm. As the Getty Research Institute emphasizes, respectful borrowing requires acknowledgment and understanding—not avoidance. Fear of mistakes shouldn’t paralyze creativity; Shakespeare never visited Verona, yet gave us *Romeo and Juliet*.  <br><br>Finally, their "better alternatives" aren’t alternatives at all—they’re **enhancements**. The Smithsonian’s guidelines don’t forbid inspiration; they route it ethically. Like seatbelts in cars, these practices make borrowing safer, but we still need the car! Advocate for policies like Canada’s Indigenous Art Protection Act, which funds collaborations while safeguarding cultural rights. Push for grants that ensure borrowing is rooted in respect.  <br><br>In sum: cultures thrive when they interact. Banning borrowing ignores humanity’s shared artistic language. Let’s champion *respectful* exchange—not build cultural borders.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws that fail to address the core ethical concerns of cultural appropriation. Their arguments rest on three problematic assumptions: that "respectful" borrowing can exist without power imbalances, that artistic freedom trumps cultural protection, and that education alone can prevent harm. We will dismantle each of these claims.<br><br>First, the affirmative claims we conflate all borrowing with exploitation, but they ignore the systemic power imbalances that make truly respectful exchange nearly impossible. While they cite Yves Saint Laurent's collaboration with Moroccan artisans as ethical, research shows such cases are outliers. A 2021 study in the Journal of Cultural Economics found that in 78% of designer-artisan collaborations, artisans received less than 5% of final profits while their cultural IP was commercialized . Even in their praised Yolŋu-Macassan pottery project, negotiations took seven years—a timeline most artists won't follow. Their solution of "respect" without structural equity is like putting a bandage on a broken bone.<br><br>Second, their human rights argument cherry-picks Article 27 while ignoring UNDRIP's Article 31, which guarantees Indigenous peoples' right to "maintain, control, protect and develop their cultural heritage" . This isn't about building walls—it's about who holds the keys. When non-Indigenous artists copy Aboriginal dot painting techniques without permission, they violate these rights while claiming "artistic freedom." The UN Special Rapporteur on Cultural Rights explicitly warns against using Article 27 to justify appropriation in their 2022 report . Rights must be balanced, not weaponized by the powerful.<br><br>Third, their faith in education over regulation is demonstrably flawed. Despite decades of awareness campaigns, Native American headdresses still appear at music festivals, and Hindu religious symbols are commodified as TikTok trends. A 2024 NAJA report found 62% of Native respondents see no reduction in cultural misuse . Education matters, but as the Smithsonian guidelines they cite actually state, it must precede—not excuse—borrowing . <br><br>Fourth, they claim ethical collaborations are the norm, but this is textbook cherry-picking. For every YSL project, there are thousands of cases like Sue Coleman's profitable knockoffs of Indigenous art or the British Museum's refusal to repatriate looted Benin Bronzes while profiting from their display . The $500 million annual loss Indigenous artists face from appropriation doesn't come from rare ethical exceptions—it comes from systemic extraction .<br><br>Finally, their "cultural borders" framing is a straw man. We don't oppose exchange—we oppose extraction. New Zealand's Toi Iho trademark system proves cultures can share while controlling use . The choice isn't between open theft and closed borders, but between exploitation and equitable partnership.<br><br>In conclusion, the affirmative's vision of "respectful borrowing" ignores power dynamics, cherry-picks rights frameworks, and overestimates voluntary ethics. True cultural exchange requires consent, not just good intentions.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes down to a fundamental choice: stifle creativity or foster ethical exchange. Our opponents demand prohibition, but their approach ignores both human rights and real-world solutions.  <br><br>First, artistic freedom is a human right. Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, affirmed by the UN, guarantees the right to participate in cultural life—a right that coexists with Indigenous protections under UNDRIP’s Article 31. According to Dr. Farida Shaheed, former UN Special Rapporteur on Cultural Rights, this balance is not only possible but necessary for cultural vitality. Opponents conflate all borrowing with exploitation, yet frameworks like the Metropolitan Museum’s 2023 ethical guidelines prove systemic change is achievable. The YSL-Morocco partnership, which paid artisans 30% above market rates, demonstrates that exploitation is not inevitable—it’s a choice we can reject.  <br><br>Second, innovation thrives on exchange. Jazz, born from African and European traditions, revolutionized music. Picasso’s African-inspired cubism reshaped modern art. While opponents cite primitivism’s harms, modern collaborations like *Moana*—co-created with Pacific Islanders—show how ethical borrowing educates and uplifts. The Smithsonian’s 2022 guidelines, praised by our opponents, explicitly require consultation, disproving their claim that education “doesn’t work.”  <br><br>Third, cultures are not static vaults but living conversations. The British Museum’s thefts are crimes; Julie Mehretu’s African-inspired abstractions are progress. Opponents offer a world without Shakespeare’s *Othello* or the fusion cuisines that define global gastronomy.  <br><br>Vote for ethical freedom—where art unites, not divides. Thank you.  <br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today’s debate hinges on whether unrestricted cultural borrowing upholds artistic freedom or perpetuates systemic harm. The affirmative’s case rests on three flawed premises: that "respectful" borrowing is easily achievable, that artistic freedom supersedes cultural protection, and that voluntary guidelines suffice to prevent harm. Our rebuttals dismantled each claim with evidence, revealing the necessity of structural safeguards.<br><br>**Power Imbalances Make "Respect" Theoretical**  <br>The affirmative celebrates outliers like YSL’s Moroccan collaboration, but research shows 78% of such partnerships undercompensate artisans while commercializing their cultural heritage . For every ethical project, countless others—like Sue Coleman’s Indigenous art knockoffs—exploit without consequence. Their defense of Picasso’s "primitivism" ignores how Modern Art’s colonial legacy still marginalizes non-European voices today . True respect requires equity, not just good intentions.  <br><br>**Artistic Freedom Cannot Trump Cultural Rights**  <br>While the affirmative cites Article 27, they ignore UNDRIP’s Article 31, which guarantees Indigenous control over cultural heritage . The UN Special Rapporteur explicitly warns against weaponizing artistic freedom to justify appropriation . This isn’t about censorship—it’s about consent. When non-Indigenous artists replicate Aboriginal dot paintings without permission, they violate these rights while claiming creative liberty.  <br><br>**Self-Regulation Fails Marginalized Communities**  <br>The affirmative’s faith in education ignores reality: 62% of Native Americans report no reduction in cultural misuse despite decades of awareness campaigns . Meanwhile, institutions like the British Museum profit from looted artifacts while touting ethical guidelines . Voluntary measures cannot address systemic extraction,<br><br></div>
