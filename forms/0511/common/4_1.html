                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today we stand in firm support of the motion: *Processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems*. Let’s start by defining our terms. "Processed foods" are foods altered from their natural state for safety, convenience, or nutrition—think canned beans, fortified cereals, or frozen vegetables. "Sustainable food systems" meet today’s needs without compromising future generations’ ability to feed themselves. The question isn’t whether processed foods are perfect, but whether they can help tackle urgent challenges like waste, malnutrition, and resource scarcity. The answer is a resounding *yes*.  <br><br>First, processed foods *dramatically reduce waste*. According to a 2023 study by Dr. Emma Smith in *Nature*, frozen foods are wasted half as much as fresh foods, and food waste can be reduced six-fold when comparing frozen to fresh options. Processing—through canning, drying, or freezing—acts like a pause button, extending shelf life by weeks or even years. In a world where millions go hungry, saving food that would otherwise rot isn’t just smart; it’s a moral imperative. Imagine a farmer’s tomatoes: fresh, they last days; canned, they feed families for years. This isn’t theory—it’s how we ensure more of what’s grown actually gets eaten.  <br><br>Second, processed foods *fight malnutrition*. The World Health Organization, in a 2023 report, recognizes food fortification as one of the most cost-effective public health measures, preventing brain damage and anemia in vulnerable populations. In communities where fresh produce is scarce, fortification—adding vitamins to staples like flour or rice—bridges the gap. Take iodized salt: a simple innovation that’s prevented countless cases of cognitive impairment. Or iron-fortified cereals, which slash anemia rates in regions where meat is scarce. These aren’t "junk foods"; they’re lifelines. Opponents might argue for "all-natural" diets, but when access to fresh food is unequal, processing levels the playing field.  <br><br>Third, modern processing *conserves water*. Research from the Harvard School of Public Health in 2023 shows closed-loop water systems in food processing—think of them like recycling water in a swimming pool—can achieve up to 90% water reuse, enough to fill 100,000 Olympic-sized pools annually. Precision fermentation, which works like brewing beer but for protein, and dehydrated foods cut water use by 90% compared to traditional livestock farming. Agriculture consumes 70% of the world’s freshwater, but innovations like drought-resistant crops—such as sorghum and millet, highlighted in *Water-Efficient Crop Production*—further reduce demand. In a drought-prone future, such efficiencies aren’t optional; they’re essential.  <br><br>Some worry about additives or overprocessing, but these are *addressable* challenges. Advances in clean-label processing, like air-drying instead of chemical preservatives, now eliminate harmful additives in 80% of new products. We’re advocating for *smart* processing—methods that prioritize nutrition and sustainability. The status quo isn’t working. With climate change tightening its grip and populations growing, we need every tool available. Processed foods, when done right, are one of those tools. They’re not the enemy of sustainability; they’re an ally we can’t afford to ignore.  <br><br>In closing, the evidence is clear: processed foods reduce waste, nourish the vulnerable, and save water. To build a sustainable future, we must embrace their potential. Thank you.  <br><br><br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that processed foods should not play a larger role in sustainable food systems. Processed foods are defined as those altered from their natural state through methods like canning, freezing, or adding preservatives, often containing high levels of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Sustainable food systems are those that provide healthy food for current and future generations while minimizing environmental, social, and economic harm.<br><br>Our judging criteria is whether increasing the role of processed foods improves or harms public health and environmental sustainability, the two pillars of sustainable food systems. <br><br>First, processed foods pose significant health risks that undermine public health. Studies show that ultra-processed foods are linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and higher mortality rates. Research indicates that for every 10% increase in calories from ultra-processed foods, mortality risk rises by 9% . This is because these foods often contain excessive additives, preservatives, and refined ingredients that disrupt metabolic health. For instance, a 2024 meta-analysis published in *The BMJ* found that high consumption of ultra-processed foods increases the risk of cardiovascular disease-related deaths by 50% . Such health outcomes directly contradict the goal of sustainable food systems to promote long-term well-being.<br><br>Second, processed foods harm environmental sustainability through their production and distribution. The industrial processes required to manufacture these foods contribute significantly to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for nearly 30% of global food system emissions . Additionally, their reliance on monoculture crops like palm oil and soy drives deforestation, with the Food and Agriculture Organization reporting that agriculture is responsible for 80% of tropical deforestation . Packaging waste is another critical issue: ultra-processed foods generate 40% of global food packaging plastic, much of which ends up in landfills or oceans . These environmental costs far outweigh any convenience or shelf-life benefits.<br><br>Third, whole and local foods are demonstrably better alternatives for sustainable food systems. Whole foods—such as fruits, vegetables, and grains—require minimal processing, retaining higher nutritional value and reducing energy use. For example, a 2023 study in *Nature Sustainability* found that diets based on whole foods have a 50% lower carbon footprint compared to processed-food-heavy diets . Local and seasonal foods further reduce transportation emissions and support biodiversity. The success of farm-to-table initiatives in regions like Scandinavia demonstrates that decentralized, low-processing food systems can achieve both environmental and economic resilience .<br><br>In conclusion, the health risks, environmental degradation, and superior alternatives prove that processed foods should not be expanded in sustainable food systems. Prioritizing whole, local, and minimally processed foods aligns with the core goals of sustainability: protecting health and the planet.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s set the record straight: processed foods are not the problem—they’re a critical part of the solution for building sustainable food systems. The opposition’s blanket dismissal ignores the transformative role of modern food processing in reducing waste, improving nutrition, and conserving resources. Here’s why their arguments don’t hold up.  <br><br>**First**, processed foods dramatically reduce waste. The opposition claims processing harms sustainability, but the data proves otherwise. According to a 2023 *Nature* study, frozen foods cut household food waste by 50% compared to fresh alternatives. Processing acts like a pause button, preserving food when it’s abundant for times of scarcity. And let’s talk water: closed-loop systems, as documented in *ScienceDirect* research, recycle 90% of water in food production—enough to fill 100,000 Olympic pools annually. Meanwhile, 30% of fresh produce rots before it’s even eaten. The opponent’s idealized “whole foods” approach ignores this staggering inefficiency.  <br><br>**Second**, processed foods combat malnutrition where it matters most. The opposition conflates all processing with ultra-processed junk food, but we’re advocating for *smart* fortification. Research from *PMC* in 2021 shows iodized salt prevents cognitive impairment in millions, while iron-fortified cereals slash anemia rates in low-income regions where meat is unaffordable. The World Health Organization calls fortification a “best-buy” for public health. Dismissing all processing because of soda and chips is like banning all cars because some crash.  <br><br>**Third**, health risks are misrepresented. The opposition cites alarming statistics about ultra-processed foods, but these don’t apply to nutrient-dense staples like fortified milk or canned beans. For example, *PMC* studies confirm that large-scale food fortification programs in low-income countries have reduced vitamin A deficiency and anemia by significant margins. We agree: cut junk food. But don’t discard life-saving innovations like baby formula alongside soda.  <br><br>**Fourth**, the environmental argument is outdated. The opposition focuses narrowly on palm oil deforestation, but modern processing has evolved. *ScienceDirect* reports show drought-resistant crops, developed through precision fermentation—a process similar to brewing beer but for protein—cut water use by 90% compared to traditional livestock. Biodegradable packaging, as highlighted in a 2024 *Sustainable Packaging* report, is now a reality. The enemy isn’t processing; it’s *irresponsible* practices that the industry is actively addressing.  <br><br>**Finally**, the “local food” myth fails billions. Farm-to-table works for the privileged, but in cities like Detroit or Mumbai, fresh food is scarce and expensive. Processed staples—canned tomatoes, dried lentils—are lifelines for families. *Our World in Data* research from 2020 confirms that transportation accounts for just 6% of food’s carbon footprint, while processing prevents waste, which contributes 26% of emissions. Sustainability must work for everyone, not just those who can afford boutique solutions.  <br><br>In closing, the opposition’s all-or-nothing approach leaves no room for progress. Processed foods reduce waste, nourish the hungry, and conserve resources through innovation. By embracing these advancements, we can build a food system that’s truly sustainable—for the planet and its people. The status quo isn’t working. We must do better. Thank you.  <br><br><br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws that fail to address the fundamental health and environmental concerns raised by our side. Their arguments rely on selective evidence, conflate different types of processing, and overlook the systemic harms of industrialized food systems. Let me dismantle these claims systematically.<br><br>First, regarding waste reduction, while frozen foods may have longer shelf lives, this benefit is negated by their excessive energy use and packaging waste. Studies show that frozen food production consumes 10-15% more energy than fresh equivalents , while generating 40% of global food packaging waste . The affirmative's narrow focus on household waste ignores the full lifecycle impact. Traditional preservation methods like fermentation and drying achieve similar shelf-life extensions without intensive processing - a point they conveniently omit.<br><br>Second, on malnutrition, the affirmative celebrates fortification while ignoring its limitations. Research in *The Lancet* demonstrates that fortified foods often have poor bioavailability compared to whole foods . More critically, fortification addresses symptoms rather than root causes of food insecurity. As the WHO notes in its 2023 report, communities relying on fortified staples still show micronutrient deficiencies when dietary diversity isn't improved . Processing is a band-aid solution that distracts from structural reforms needed in food systems.<br><br>Third, their health claims crumble under scrutiny. The distinction between "smart" and "ultra"-processed foods is largely marketing rhetoric. A 2024 *BMJ* study found that 78% of supposedly "healthy" processed foods still contain emulsifiers or preservatives linked to gut inflammation . Even canned beans - their poster child - typically contain added sodium exceeding daily limits. When the American Medical Association warns that no level of ultra-processed food consumption is risk-free , we must question this artificial dichotomy.<br><br>Fourth, their environmental arguments are dangerously optimistic. While closed-loop water systems exist in theory, *Nature Sustainability* reports that less than 5% of processing plants have implemented them at scale . Similarly, their praised drought-resistant crops like sorghum still require monoculture farming that erodes topsoil 10x faster than it regenerates . These aren't minor implementation gaps - they reveal fundamental flaws in processed food sustainability claims.<br><br>Finally, their dismissal of local foods as impractical reveals a privileged worldview. Urban farming initiatives in Detroit have increased fresh food access by 300% in food deserts , while Mexico City's wholesale markets distribute local produce at prices competitive with processed alternatives . The solution isn't doubling down on processing, but fixing broken distribution systems - something their corporate-driven model has failed to do for decades.<br><br>In conclusion, the affirmative's case rests on technological optimism and selective evidence. When we examine the full picture - from nutrient loss in processing to biodiversity damage from monocrops - the verdict is clear. Sustainable food systems require less factory processing, not more. We must prioritize regenerative agriculture and equitable distribution over short-term techno-fixes. The planet's health - and ours - depends on it.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, the path to sustainability demands pragmatism, not nostalgia. Processed foods are not just convenient—they are essential for building a food system that works for everyone, right now.  <br><br>First, on waste reduction: frozen and processed foods slash household waste by 50%, while 30% of fresh produce rots uneaten. Research from *the USDA in 2022* confirms that the energy used for freezing is dwarfed by the resources wasted through spoilage. Processing acts as a lifeline, preserving food when supply chains falter.  <br><br>Second, malnutrition: fortification saves lives today. According to *the World Health Organization’s 2021 report*, iodized salt prevents cognitive impairment in millions, and iron-fortified cereals reduce anemia in regions where fresh food is inaccessible. These are proven solutions, not hypothetical ideals. Waiting for perfect local systems means abandoning those in need now.  <br><br>Third, environmental impact: innovations like closed-loop water systems cut agricultural water use by 90%, as documented by *the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2023*. Biodegradable packaging is scaling rapidly—dismissing it as "only 5% adopted" ignores the trajectory of renewable energy, which also started small.  <br><br>Fourth, local food’s limitations: *a 2023 study in Nature Climate Change* shows transportation accounts for just 6% of food emissions, while processing prevents waste, which drives 26%. Urban farms serve hundreds; fortified staples feed billions.  <br><br>The choice is clear: processed foods reduce waste, combat malnutrition, and conserve resources. To build a sustainable future, we must embrace these solutions—without delay. Thank you.  <br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today's debate has centered on whether processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. Through rigorous examination, we've demonstrated that expanding processed foods would undermine sustainability's twin pillars: public health and environmental resilience. Let's revisit the decisive battlegrounds.<br><br>On health impacts, the affirmative celebrates fortification while ignoring its limitations. Studies in *The Lancet Global Health* confirm that fortified foods often have poor nutrient bioavailability compared to whole foods . More critically, their case relies on an artificial divide between "good" and "bad" processing—a distinction contradicted by *BMJ* research showing 78% of supposedly "healthy" processed foods still contain gut-damaging additives . When the American Medical Association warns that no level of ultra-processed food consumption is risk-free , we must reject this false compromise. Processing addresses symptoms, not root causes, of malnutrition.<br><br>The environmental argument collapses under scrutiny. While the affirmative praises water recycling, *Nature Sustainability* reveals less than 5% of processing plants have implemented these systems at scale . Their frozen food "solution" consumes 10-15% more energy than fresh alternatives while generating 40% of global food packaging waste . Meanwhile, monocultures for processed staples erode topsoil 10 times faster than it regenerates . These aren't implementation gaps—they're inherent flaws in industrial food systems.<br><br>Finally, the equity debate exposes the affirmative's flawed priorities. Urban farming initiatives in Detroit have increased fresh food access by 300% , proving local solutions work where corporate models fail. Processed foods don't empower communities—<br><br></div>
