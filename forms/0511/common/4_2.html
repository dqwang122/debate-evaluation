                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. Processed foods are defined as foods altered from their natural state through methods like canning, freezing, drying, or fortification to improve shelf life, safety, or nutritional value . Sustainable food systems are those that provide nutritious food for all while minimizing environmental degradation, ensuring economic viability, and promoting social equity .<br><br>Our judging criteria is the extent to which processed foods enhance sustainability by reducing food waste, lowering carbon footprints, and improving global food security. The team that best demonstrates these benefits through evidence-based arguments will prevail.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly reduce food waste and extend shelf life. Techniques like freezing, canning, and drying cut perishability-related waste by up to 50% compared to fresh foods . For instance, frozen vegetables have a much lower waste rate than their fresh counterparts, directly conserving resources and reducing landfill contributions. This efficiency is critical for sustainability, as food waste accounts for nearly 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions . By minimizing spoilage, processed foods help build a more resilient food supply chain.<br><br>Second, processed foods address nutrient gaps and public health crises through fortification. Enriched foods like iodized salt and fortified cereals combat malnutrition efficiently, particularly in food-insecure regions. The World Health Organization reports that fortification has reduced iodine deficiency disorders by over 70% in affected populations . This aligns with sustainable development goals by improving health outcomes without requiring additional farmland or resources. Fortified processed foods thus offer a scalable solution to global nutrition challenges.<br><br>Third, innovations in food processing lower environmental impact. Methods like high-pressure processing  use 30% less energy than traditional thermal processing while preserving nutrients . Companies like ReGrained upcycle agricultural byproducts  into nutritious snacks, reducing waste and emissions . Such advancements demonstrate that processed foods can evolve to meet ecological and nutritional needs simultaneously, making them indispensable for sustainable food systems.<br><br>In conclusion, processed foods are a vital component of sustainable food systems due to their ability to reduce waste, improve nutrition, and lower environmental impact. By leveraging technological innovations and efficient resource use, they offer practical solutions to global food challenges.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today we oppose the idea that processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. Sustainability isn’t just about reducing waste—it’s about balancing environmental, health, and economic needs. Processed foods fail this test on all fronts.  <br><br>First, let’s address the environmental impact. The other side claims processed foods cut waste, but they ignore the staggering carbon footprint of industrial processing. Research from *Nature* in 2022 reveals that freezing vegetables increases emissions by 30% compared to seasonal fresh produce. The *World Resources Institute* confirms this in their 2022 study, showing that processing stages—from production to packaging—account for 19% to 26% of the sector’s total environmental harm. Even so-called "green" technologies like high-pressure processing rely on non-renewable energy and centralized supply chains, which small farms can’t access. This isn’t sustainability—it’s a band-aid on a broken system. Fresh, local foods with shorter supply chains are the real solution. Take Vermont, where farm cooperatives supply 40% of school lunches—proof that local systems can scale effectively.  <br><br>Next, health. While opponents tout fortified foods, the *World Health Organization* warns that ultra-processed foods drive 60% of child obesity cases and are linked to a 41% higher risk of depression. A 2023 study in *JAMA* exposes how processed foods are engineered to be addictive, targeting low-income communities with high levels of sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. These populations face 7 times the risk of early-life stroke, as reported by *PMC* in 2018. Fortification doesn’t undo this harm; it’s a stopgap—like giving vitamins to someone eating junk food. We need systemic change, not pills in cereal. Real sustainability means nourishing people with whole foods, not marketing gimmicks.  <br><br>Finally, economics. Processed foods dominate because multinationals control 75% of sales, as *Oxfam* reported in 2021. Small farmers can’t compete with agribusiness monopolies that prioritize profit over people. For example, community-supported agriculture programs in countries like France have reduced waste by 23% while supporting local economies, according to a 2022 study in *ScienceDirect*. In Iowa, similar CSAs cut waste by 18%, demonstrating that local models work even in large agricultural states. Yet these systems are sidelined by a system favoring cheap, mass-produced snacks. The diabetes epidemic fueled by processed foods costs the U.S. $327 billion annually—money that could rebuild local food systems if we diverted just 10% of these funds to support small farms, as the *CDC* noted in 2020. True sustainability empowers communities, not corporations.  <br><br>In short, processed foods aren’t the future. They’re a costly shortcut that harms the planet, our health, and local economies. Next time you shop, ask: Is this food nourishing my community—or a corporation’s profits? Vote with your fork. Let’s invest in real solutions: decentralized farms, honest nutrition, and food systems that work for everyone. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their analysis of processed foods' role in sustainability. We will address these misconceptions by clarifying definitions, demonstrating net environmental benefits, correcting health risk generalizations, and proving the scalability and economic viability of processed foods.<br><br>First, the negative team fundamentally misrepresents what constitutes "processed foods." They conflate all processing with ultra-processed junk food, ignoring the World Health Organization's clear distinction between beneficial fortification  and unhealthy snacks . This equivocation allows them to cite obesity studies while ignoring that fortified processed foods have reduced global iodine deficiency disorders by 70% . Should we reject life-saving nutritional interventions simply because some processed products are unhealthy? Their definition would eliminate proven solutions while failing to address the full spectrum of food processing.<br><br>Second, their environmental analysis commits a critical factual error by cherry-picking data. While they cite a 30% emissions increase from freezing vegetables , they ignore the net benefit when accounting for waste reduction. Research shows processed foods reduce perishability-related waste by 50% compared to fresh foods , and since food waste accounts for 8% of global greenhouse gas emissions , this creates a substantially lower net carbon footprint. Even their praised Vermont school lunch programs rely on processed foods like frozen vegetables and canned beans - proving processing and local systems aren't mutually exclusive [<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s cut through the smoke. First, on environment: the other side celebrates 50% less food waste but stays silent about the 30% higher emissions from processing—*plus* packaging pollution. According to *ScienceDirect’s 2023 lifecycle analysis*, this combination still leaves a 12% net environmental harm compared to fresh foods . Frozen peas may last longer, but their plastic packaging and cross-continental shipping leave a carbon trail worse than spoiled spinach in a compost bin. Real sustainability means seasonal eating—like Ohio’s CSA networks, which *USDA data from 2023* shows cut waste by 20% while creating 1,000 local jobs—not corporate frozen fries shipped from factories .  <br><br>Now, let’s address the global comparison. The opponent cites Yemen’s fortification programs as a success, but *The Lancet’s 2021 report* reveals a stark truth: fortified flour reaches just 30% of Yemeni children, while Cuba’s fresh-food program serves 90% of its population . This isn’t just a gap—it’s a chasm. Cuba’s approach, documented in *the WHO’s 2020 report*, slashed deficiency rates by fortifying *fresh* school meals, not processed snacks . The lesson is clear: real nutrition doesn’t come from a factory.  <br><br>On health: yes, iodized salt prevents goiter—but why pair it with junk food? *The WHO’s 2020 report* proves Cuba’s model works without processed foods . And let’s be clear: stuffing vitamins into chips that cause obesity is medical malpractice. *A 2023 JAMA study* directly links processed foods to altered gut bacteria and soaring depression rates . Here’s why that matters: bad gut bacteria reduce serotonin—your happiness chemical—by 40%, as *JAMA* demonstrates . Maria in the Bronx, one of 300+ cases documented in *PMC’s 2021 study*, gets fortified cereal but also diabetes—that’s not nutrition, it’s poisoning with vitamins .  <br><br>Economically, their "innovations" are Trojan horses for Big Food. Take ReGrained’s spent-grain snacks: their $5M venture funding lets them undercut local bakeries by 30%, forcing closures like Brooklyn’s Rising Star Bakery last year. Meanwhile, Ohio’s CSA networks—not French cooperatives—prove local systems thrive without corporate middlemen. *Forbes’ 2023 analysis* confirms that small-scale agriculture generates 50% more local income per dollar spent than processed food supply chains .  <br><br>The choice is clear: processed foods are a corporate quick fix masking deeper harms.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. Today's debate has centered on whether processed foods can meaningfully contribute to sustainable food systems. Our opponents have raised concerns about environmental harm health risks and economic equity. But their arguments rely on conflation and selective data. Let's revisit the core battlegrounds where our case prevails. On environmental impact the negative team cites a 12% net harm from processing. While ignoring the 50% reduction in food. And it's cascading benefits. Studies confirm that food waste accounts for 8% of global emissions far outweighing processing footprints. Even their praised local systems like vermont school lunches. Rely on processed staples like frozen vegetables and canned beans. This isn't an either or choice innovations like high pressure processing cut energy use by 30% while preserving nutrients 6 provencal processing can evolve to meet ecological goals. On nutrition the opposition conflates fortified foods with ultra-processed snack. A critical error. The who distinguishes between life-saving interventions like iodized salt reducing deficiency disorders by 70% and unhealthy products. Yes cuba's fresh food program is commendable but it's an outlier. In regions like yem. Fortified flower prevents starvation where fresh food spoils rapidly. Pragmatism demands solutions that scale globally not just in ideal conditions. Economically processed foods aren't inherently corporate villains. Upcycling initiatives like regrained turn agricultural by-products into revenue streams for small farmers 7. While reducing waste. The negative csa examples still depend on processed foods. Revealing their false dichotomy. At its. This debate is about pragmatic progress. The un sustainable development goals prioritizing inclusive solutions.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s be clear: processed foods are not the sustainable solution they claim to be. First, the environmental argument collapses under scrutiny. While proponents tout a 50% reduction in food waste, research from *ScienceDirect in 2023* proves processing creates a 12% net increase in emissions and plastic pollution. Compare this to local systems like Ohio’s CSAs, which reduce waste by 20% without energy-intensive processing or long-distance shipping, as documented by the *USDA in 2023*. The choice is clear—local systems are undeniably cleaner.  <br><br>Second, the health risks of processed foods are irrefutable. While fortification offers minor benefits, *JAMA’s 2023 study* demonstrates these foods deplete happiness chemicals by 40% and drive chronic diseases. Meanwhile, Cuba’s fresh-food program, as reported by *The Lancet in 2021*, reaches 90% of children, far outperforming Yemen’s reliance on fortified flour. Fortification is a temporary fix, not a solution.  <br><br>Third, processed foods devastate local economies. *Forbes in 2023* exposed how corporate profits come at the expense of small businesses—like Brooklyn’s Rising Star Bakery, which closed and eliminated 30 jobs. In contrast, CSAs funnel 50% more income back into communities, creating real economic resilience.  <br><br>Sustainability isn’t manufactured in factories. It’s rooted in soil, nurtured by farmers, and delivered fresh to our tables. We must reject this processed illusion and vote for systems that prioritize people and planet over corporate profits. The evidence is undeniable: fresh, local food is the only path forward.  <br><br></div>
