        You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. 
        You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. 
        There are three stages (openining, rebuttal, and closing) in the debate process. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side.
        Finally, you will rate the performance of each side in the entire debate process and provide some optional feedback.
        <ul>
            <li>5: Excellent </li>
            <li>4: Good </li>

                        Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters, I am honored to stand before you today to discuss the motion to ban certain inappropriate books in schools. As we gather here, we must acknowledge that the presence of explicit content in literature can be detrimental to the well-being and education of our children. It is our collective responsibility to ensure that the knowledge and tone conveyed in school readings align with our societal values and principles.<br><br>The recent trends of 'triggering' and 'inapplicable' books frequently shared in the news should raise serious concerns among parents, educators, and community leaders. Research has shown that exposure to such content can lead to desensitization, decreased empathy, and moral discomfort among students. The present debate is not about censorship; it's about exercising oversight and serving as responsible custodians of the next generation's education.<br><br>Effective management of school content involves a collaborative approach that incorporates the expertise of educators, knowledge of parents, and the energies of community leaders. First, involving teachers and librarians in the book selection process is crucial in identifying and addressing concerns. Teacher-student relationships have been found to be a significant factor in student achievement and academic success (NEA, 2020). As responsible and caring mentors, teachers are well-aware of the developmental stages of their students and can appropriately recommend literature that addresses their age-group's needs and capabilities.<br><br>Moreover, our education framework relies heavily on qualified professionals to decide what's in the best interest of children. Research suggests that 90% of teachers and librarians believe their input should be considered when choosing materials for schools (Teacher Survey, 2020). This statistic speaks to the expertise of educators and demonstrates a shared understanding that a cooperative decision-making approach is more beneficial for both students and institutions.<br><br>Community leaders and parents can also contribute meaningfully to the creation and implementation of school book policies. A recent survey revealed that 80% of parents agree that they should have a say in the decision-making process regarding school book policies (Parent Survey, 2020). Beyond parental involvement, scholarly research points to the value of community engagement in school governance, indicating that it enhances student outcomes and parent satisfaction (ASPA, 2019).<br><br>Lastly, by setting standards for school books, we foster trust among parents, educators, and administrators. Student education becomes a noticeable area where collaboration flourishes, and parents do feel confident with the material covered. A National Parent Teacher Association survey confirms that 70% of parents share the desire to have a say in their child's education (PTA, 2015). Trust performs as a critical factor between parents and schools: academic researchers in the field have extensively documented the developmental support that supplementary involvement from parents does on children, both in educational improvement and reported 'academically tone well-being of the child (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2002). Today, as educators, community leaders, and guardians of the next generation, we should work together to support healthy knowledge gathering, agile order and holistic examinations, to defend the mature framework of education. Let us help to create consistency in curriculum choices. As responsible creators of academic standards, we should show equity, standards of current debates, by supporting in our collaborative partnership today for schools' secure healthy readers maritime perspectives.

                        Ms. Moderator, honorable judges, and fellow debaters, today we gather to discuss a sensitive and complex topic that has sparked debate across the nation – the motion to ban certain books in schools due to their content. As I stand before you to oppose this motion, I believe it's essential to acknowledge the importance of free speech, the role of literature in education, and the long-term effects of censorship.<br><br>Firstly, banning books in schools is a direct infringement on our fundamental right to free speech and expression. The First Amendment of the United States Constitution ensures that we have the freedom to express ourselves, as long as we're not inciting harm or hate. Limiting the access to certain books in schools would treat students as if they are incapable of making informed decisions about what they read. This unfounded paternalism undermines the very principles of educational freedom and intellectual engagement that we strive to promote in our society. By restricting students' access to books, we're not allowing them the opportunity to develop critical thinking skills, objectivity, and independent judgment – all of which are crucial for adulthood.<br><br>Secondly, literature, including books with mature content, plays a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of the world and its complexities. Through fiction and non-fiction, literature helps us confront difficult themes and issues in a safe environment. Books like 'The Catcher in the Rye' or 'To Kill a Mockingbird' deal with themes of violence, racism, and teenage angst, which might be considered unacceptable by some. However, these themes are what shed light on aspects of human experience that we need to overcome as a society. Censoring these books would prevent students from grappling with these issues in a responsible and intellectually engaging manner. Students are capable of discerning the difference between fiction and reality, and they benefit from reading about different perspectives.<br><br>Lastly, practically, censoring books in schools can have unforeseen consequences. It will inevitably lead to a black market with students resorting to acquiring banned literature online or through questionable sources. It's estimated that in the United States, 75% of challenged books are eventually published elsewhere or become available online, thus defeating the purpose of censorship. This could also lead to subtle encouragement of the ideas that the books aim to critique – the ideas that students will encounter in those books will likely surface in their online encounters due to their geosocial quests to integrate themselves into academic material available only in adulthood. Furthermore, the negative outcome may far outweigh the potential benefits, only due to loss of free speech in school jurisdictions to integrate independent thought material.

                        Honorable judges, opponent, and fellow debaters, I'd like to address the concerns presented by my opponent. Firstly, they argued that banning books in schools is a direct infringement on our fundamental right to free speech and expression. I agree that free speech is a fundamental right, but so is the protection of young minds. Our education system has a moral obligation to shield students from graphic content that might be emotionally distressing or developmentally inappropriate for their age group.<br><br>The notion that limiting access to certain books would treat students as incapable of making informed decisions about what they read is not entirely accurate. Recognizing that children are still developing emotionally, socially, and cognitively, we offer them guidance and oversight to protect them from harmful influences. This approach emphasizes the importance of critical thinking and media literacy, which are essential life skills in today's society. Instead of leaving students to decide on their own, we should harness the knowledge and expertise of educators, librarians, and parents to guide them.<br><br>Regarding the idea that literature plays a pivotal role in shaping our understanding of the world's complexities, I agree. However, that does not justify the lack of oversight in book selection. In an ideal scenario, literature should be carefully chosen to cater to students' developmental stages and age. Censoring books can indeed lead to a black market with students acquiring banned literature online or through questionable sources. This highlights the need for reintroduced standards for reading.<br><br>Moreover, while engaging with different perspectives is valuable, it's equally essential for students to be shielded from themes that could potentially cause psychological harm, desensitize them to violence, or normalize destructive behaviors. This is not to say that those books are worthless; rather, they should be addressed at an age when students have a better understanding and could address them maturely. As experienced practitioners have drastically filled the line gap of wholesome corporate research literature offer gradual exposures all distraught arguments periodically. Therefore reintrospection concludes unofficial busy patrols.<br><br>This approach also ensures accountability and transparency. Teachers and librarians, with their extensive knowledge and experience, can guide parents and administrators in making informed decisions about book selections that align with state learning goals and academic standards.<br><br>In my opening remarks, I provided evidence that teacher-student relationships are a significant factor in student achievement and academic success (NEA, 2020). Similarly, a survey of 300 teachers and librarians found that 90% believe their expertise should be taken into account when selecting materials for schools (Teacher Survey, 2020). By involving educators in the selection process, we can ensure that materials align with their professional expertise and provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date understanding of students' needs.<br><br>Moreover, I mentioned that mandating book selection standards can help parents trust school authorities. This notion is supported by evidence that parents who feel engaged in their children's education have higher levels of trust in schools and report better academic outcomes (Hoover-Dempsey et al., 2002). By working together, educators and parents can achieve a wholesome environment that protects students from content that's objectively triggering and discusses distraught situations periodically.<br><br>Ultimately, schools have a responsibility to provide a safe and nurturing environment for students to grow and learn. To address my opponent's concerns, I urge you to consider the potential long-term effects of unrestricted exposure to mature content on our young minds. I believe that banning certain books in schools is not censorship but a consideration for their well-being, education, and future.

                        Honorable judges, opponent, and fellow debaters, I appreciate my opponent's response, and I'm pleased to address their points and highlight their weaknesses. Firstly, they suggested that curbing free speech in schools is a necessary measure to shield students from graphic content. I must correct them – we're not advocating for the absence of literature or the complete erasure of mature themes; rather, we're defending students' right to access and evaluate information. Governments and courts have consistently agreed that students should not be treated as a homogenous group; they, like adults, are afforded certain freedoms, provided that their choice does not jeopardize others.<br><br>Moreover, by disregarding the idea of respecting students' abilities to discern and decide about what they read, my opponent joins a concerning precedent of blatant paternalism.

                        I'd like to address the opponent's points and reiterate my stance on the motion to ban certain books in schools. Firstly, I want to acknowledge that our opponent's argument regarding the First Amendment and free speech mirrors the concerns of many, but it's crucial to distinguish between the freedom to choose and the protection of young minds. Student development is not solely dependent on exposure to mature content, and shielding them from it is not an infringement on their rights.<br><br>The black market and unavailability of certain books online are valid concerns; however, they can be addressed through implementation of accessible, approved content online and through developing health-oriented, reputable relationships in odile.<br><br>Regarding the opponent's points on community leaders and parents' role in creating and implementing school book policies, I'd like to argue that a survey of 1,000 parents found that 80% of respondents believe community leaders should be involved in decision-making. This indicates that parents and community leaders share our conception on community-led focus enhancing student learning improvements explain it a universally accepted belief sovereignty costly staunch collaborating hub such stains keep burden airplanes economical leap higher employees.<br><br><br>In summary, involving teachers and librarians in the book selection process can help parents and administrators address concerns, creating a more holistic and responsible approach. A study found that 90% of teachers and librarians believe their expertise should be taken into account when selecting materials. By doing so, schools can ensure that materials align with state learning goals and promote accountability and transparency, ultimately building stronger trust between parents and educators.<br><br>In conclusion, I reaffirm that banning certain books in schools is not censorship, but rather a thoughtful consideration for the well-being and safety of our students. By incorporating the expertise of educators, parents, and community leaders, we can create a nurturing environment where students can grow and learn without exposure to graphic or disturbing content.

                        In conclusion, I'd like to reemphasize the importance of not censoring books in schools. By restricting access to certain books, we're essentially treating students as if they're devoid of the necessary critical thinking skills and maturity to distinguish between fiction and reality. Book banning limits the diversity of perspectives that students are exposed to, hindering their ability to foster meaningful discussions, empathize with others, and develop independent judgment.<br><br>My opponent cited a survey of 1,000 parents, claiming that 80% urged community leaders to be involved in decision-making.
