        You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. 
        You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. 
        There are three stages (openining, rebuttal, and closing) in the debate process. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side.
        Finally, you will rate the performance of each side in the entire debate process and provide some optional feedback.
        <ul>
            <li>5: Excellent </li>
            <li>4: Good </li>

                        Ladies and gentlemen, esteemed judges, and fellow debaters,<br><br>Today, we address a motion of paramount importance: whether we should ban certain inappropriate books, such as those depicting explicit sexual content, graphic violence, and drug use, from school environments. I stand firmly in support of this motion. The core mission of any educational institution is to nurture and educate young minds in a safe, constructive environment. Banning certain inappropriate books within schools is essential for maintaining this mission, ensuring the protection of students' well-being, and promoting age-appropriate learning. My arguments are firmly based on three crucial claims: safeguarding young minds, maintaining educational focus, and promoting a positive school environment.<br><br>Firstly, we must consider the paramount responsibility of safeguarding young minds. Our education system is built upon a foundation that seeks to develop the intellectual and emotional maturity of students. Allowing access to books with explicit sexual content, extreme violence, or glorifications of drug use prematurely exposes students to materials they are not yet equipped to process responsibly. The developmental stage of children and teenagers is marked by significant growth and malleability; they are highly impressionable, and their ability to distinguish between reality and fiction is still being honed. Exposure to inappropriate content can result in confused moral perspectives and facilitate negative behavioral patterns, potentially leading adolescents towards real-life risky behaviors. By imposing a ban on these books, we protect them from premature exposure to harsh realities that can negatively affect their mental and emotional health.<br><br>Secondly, maintaining educational focus is essential to fulfilling the primary mission of schools. Educational content must be aligned with curricular objectives that aim to impart knowledge, build critical thinking skills, and foster an appreciation of diverse perspectives, all while ensuring that students are exposed to materials that are suitable for their age group. Inappropriate books, which often focus more on shock value than substantive dialogue, can disrupt this educational focus. They distract from relevant academic content and can provoke unnecessary controversy, turning classrooms into battlegrounds over appropriateness rather than places of learning. By concentrating students’ attention on age-appropriate, enlightening content, schools fulfill their mission to educate, not sensationalize or destabilize.<br><br>Lastly, promoting a positive school environment is crucial for student success. The presence of controversial literature can foster divisiveness among students, parents, and educators, and can create conflict that detracts from the school’s overall atmosphere. Disagreement over the suitability of specific texts can lead to significant parental backlash and community dissent, drawing attention away from real educational needs. Moreover, feelings of discomfort, intimidation, or exclusion can arise among students subjected to content that is out of alignment with their cultural, moral, or personal beliefs. By eliminating inappropriate books, schools can foster an inclusive, respectful, and focused educational environment where students feel secure and are more inclined to partake in productive dialogue.<br><br>In conclusion, ensuring the educational welfare of our youth must be the chief concern of our schools, and banning certain inappropriate books made available to students is a step toward achieving this imperative. Protecting young minds, maintaining educational focus, and promoting a harmonious school environment are not just desirable outcomes but necessary actions for nurturing the well-being and proper development of our students. We must take a stand to prioritize education and safeguard the psychological and moral growth of those who will shape our future. Thank you.

                        Honorable judges, esteemed colleagues, and fellow members of the audience, we stand before you today to firmly oppose the motion to ban certain books in schools. While we understand the concerns about sensitive content, we believe that censoring literature, even with the best intentions, is a deeply flawed approach with far-reaching negative consequences. Banning books ultimately inhibits students’ intellectual growth, hinders their development into empathetic individuals, and undermines the very principles of intellectual freedom and democracy upon which our society thrives.<br><br>Firstly, censoring books directly impedes the development of critical thinking skills, skills essential not only for academic success but also for navigating the complexities of life itself. A study published by the American Educational Research Association found a strong correlation between exposure to controversial topics and higher critical thinking abilities among students. By grappling with challenging themes found in literature, students learn to analyze different perspectives, evaluate arguments, and formulate their own informed opinions. Shielding students from these complex issues does not erase their existence; it merely leaves individuals ill-equipped to engage thoughtfully with the world around them. As the National Council of Teachers of English aptly states, critical discussions around complex themes in literature are crucial for strengthening problem-solving skills, a cornerstone of critical thinking.<br><br>Secondly, exposure to diverse narratives, even those containing difficult subject matter, plays a pivotal role in fostering empathy and understanding among young minds. Research published in the Journal of Applied Social Psychology highlights the power of fiction in particular, demonstrating that reading fictional accounts enhances empathetic understanding of others’ experiences, even if those experiences differ vastly from our own. Literature has the unique ability to transport readers into the shoes of others, allowing them to connect with diverse perspectives and cultivate a sense of shared humanity. By censoring books that address sensitive topics, we deprive students of valuable opportunities to engage with the realities of the human experience in all its complexities. A report by the Council on Foreign Relations further emphasizes this point, highlighting the crucial role of diverse literature in fostering global empathy and dismantling harmful stereotypes. <br><br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, censorship of any kind, particularly when it comes to literature, poses a grave threat to intellectual freedom and the very foundations of a democratic society. The Freedom to Read Foundation, a staunch advocate for open access to information, warns that censoring books sets a dangerous precedent, normalizing the suppression of diverse ideas and paving the way for further restrictions on freedom of expression. This restriction on the free exchange of ideas can have a chilling effect on intellectual discourse, hindering creativity, innovation, and progress. In its report on censorship, UNESCO explicitly links censorship to the weakening of democratic norms as it directly limits access to varied perspectives and undermines the free flow of information essential for a healthy democracy. <br><br>In conclusion, while we acknowledge the good intentions behind this motion, we firmly believe that banning books is a misguided approach with detrimental consequences. Censoring literature not only stifles critical thinking and limits empathy development, but it also erodes the very principles of intellectual freedom and democracy that are fundamental to a thriving society. Instead of resorting to censorship, let us empower our students to become critical thinkers, empathetic individuals, and engaged citizens by providing them with access to a wide range of literature and encouraging open dialogue within a supportive educational environment. <br>

                        Honorable judges, esteemed colleagues, and members of the audience, I appreciate my opponent’s perspective on the necessity of exposure to challenging literature to foster critical thinking, empathy, and uphold democratic values. However, their arguments overlook critical aspects of why some censorship, especially in educational settings, may be not only justified but necessary.<br><br>Firstly, let us tackle the assumption that exposure to all types of content in literature invariably enhances critical thinking. While it is true that students benefit from engaging with complex themes, it is naive to believe that all literature serves an educational purpose appropriate for a school setting. My opponent references a study by the American Educational Research Association highlighting the importance of grappling with controversial topics. Yes, discussing challenging subjects can build critical skills—but this should be done in a context where students are ready and guided appropriately. It is not about erasing complex issues, but about presenting them in an age-appropriate fashion. Furthermore, research indicates that inappropriate material, when introduced prematurely, can lead to confusion or distress rather than constructive learning. Students can develop critical skills through guided and intentional selection of literature that challenges thinking without exposing them to harm.<br><br>Secondly, regarding the development of empathy, literature is indeed a powerful tool. However, presuming that all books containing graphic or explicit content inherently encourage empathy is flawed. Empathy should arise from narratives that respect students' developmental stages and moral growth. My opponent cites research indicating fiction’s capacity to nurture understanding, yet they fail to acknowledge that not all controversial content leads to empathy. Some depictions, particularly those highly sensationalized or out of context, can perpetuate stereotypes and misunderstandings. The objective is to cultivate empathy through works that engage students without placing them in potentially harmful positions. Literature selection must ensure this balance, thereby reinforcing empathetic learning without reliance on extreme content.<br><br>Finally, my opponent’s argument on intellectual freedom and democracy misconstrues the intent of educational settings, which is to protect and nurture developing minds rather than place undue burdens upon them. The Freedom to Read Foundation and UNESCO underscore the dangers of censorship in broader society; however, educational institutions occupy a unique position where content regulation is a practice oriented towards student welfare. Democratic societies entrust educational institutions to guide youth effectively, not subject them to premature exposure to inappropriate material. Decisions about content in schools should align with developmental appropriateness rather than blanket policies against censorship.<br><br>In specifics, let us remind ourselves: the integrity of our educational institutions relies on their ability to protect, educate, and prepare students for the world—all while ensuring their mental and emotional well-being. Some literature's explicit content directly undercuts this responsibility. While we stand against blanket censorship, moderating content in schools ensures students mature intellectually without undue exposure to material potentially disruptive or harmful. Our responsibility is to enhance readiness for real-world issues with guidance, not shock. In conclusion, supporting selective bans within educational contexts is about nurturing an environment that aligns with students’ readiness to engage with the world intellectually and emotionally. Thank you.

                        My esteemed opponent raises several valid points about the role of age-appropriateness and the potential impact of controversial content. However, their arguments ultimately rest on a fundamental misconception: that censorship is the most effective way to address these concerns. While we share the goal of protecting and educating our youth, we believe that censorship, even when presented as selective or well-intentioned, ultimately does more harm than good.<br><br>My opponent argues that exposure to all types of literature does not necessarily enhance critical thinking, particularly in educational settings where age-appropriateness is paramount. We agree that age-appropriateness is a critical factor in curriculum design. However, we propose that instead of resorting to outright bans, which are often arbitrarily applied, we should address this concern through careful curriculum development and open communication between educators, parents, and students. Collaborative efforts to curate reading lists, provide context for complex themes, and facilitate age-appropriate discussions would be far more effective than blanket bans. Such an approach empowers educators to tailor their teaching to their students’ maturity levels and encourages nuanced engagement with challenging topics, ultimately fostering a more intellectually stimulating and enriching learning environment. <br><br>While my opponent contends that empathy should be cultivated through narratives carefully chosen for students' developmental stages and moral growth, their argument relies on the false premise that any exposure to potentially controversial content is inherently harmful. To assume that students are incapable of engaging thoughtfully with complex issues or that they will automatically adopt negative viewpoints presented in literature is to underestimate their intellectual capacity and critical thinking skills. It's not about shielding students from potentially uncomfortable realities but about equipping them with the tools to navigate those realities responsibly.  Engaging with diverse perspectives, even those deemed controversial, can actually challenge stereotypes, broaden understanding, and ultimately foster empathy. <br><br>Finally, my opponent attempts to draw a distinction between censorship in broader society and content moderation in educational settings, arguing that schools have a unique responsibility to protect developing minds. While we agree that schools have a duty to protect students, we firmly believe that censorship is fundamentally incompatible with that responsibility. By restricting access to certain books, we create a culture of fear and silence around important conversations, ultimately hindering students’ intellectual and emotional growth. This censorship sets a dangerous precedent, limiting students’ ability to engage with diverse perspectives, develop their own informed opinions, and become responsible citizens in a democratic society. <br><br>Our position is not about advocating for unrestricted access to all materials at all ages. It is about recognizing the inherent dangers of censorship and advocating for a more nuanced, thoughtful approach to addressing valid concerns about age-appropriateness and potentially sensitive content. A democratic society thrives on the free exchange of ideas, and that exchange must be protected, nurtured, and encouraged, especially within the walls of our educational institutions. We must empower our students to become critical thinkers, empathetic individuals, and engaged citizens by providing them with access to a wide range of literature and trusting them to grapple with complex issues in a supportive environment.  We must protect the freedom to read and learn, even from materials some might deem controversial, to safeguard intellectual freedom and democratic values for future generations. <br>

                        Honorable judges, esteemed colleagues, and members of the audience, as we conclude this debate, it is clear that while my opponent advocates for expanded access to all literature, they overlook the critical responsibility of schools in protecting young minds. Our stand is not about stifling intellectual freedom, but making content decisions that prioritize the well-being and appropriate development of students within educational environments.<br><br>First, we recognize the necessity of age-appropriateness in literature as a fundamental educational guideline. Our stance supports structured, intentional curriculum design where material aligns with students’ maturity levels without resorting to haphazard censorship or exposing them prematurely to explicit content.<br><br>Second, my opponent suggests that banning is a form of underestimation of student capacity for critical thinking. Yet, our approach does not undermine students' potential. Instead, it safeguards emotional and mental health, cultivating critical and empathetic skills through appropriately challenging, guided discussions without the potential harm of sensationalist content.<br><br>Lastly, regarding the idea of censorship setting a dangerous precedent, the core of our argument is rooted in the specialized setting of schools. Institutions must retain the right to select materials that fulfill educational goals while ensuring student safety and developmental readiness.<br><br>In conclusion, supporting the selective banning of inappropriate books in schools is a necessary measure. It reinforces a protective framework that fosters a healthy, supportive, and constructive learning environment. We must prioritize safeguarding the development of our youth, ensuring they are prepared as informed, empathetic, and critical thinkers for the future. Thank you.

                        My opponent argues for the necessity of selective bans to protect young minds, yet they fail to acknowledge a critical point: censorship, however well-intentioned, ultimately limits students’ ability to engage critically with the world around them. While age-appropriateness is undoubtedly important, it should be addressed through thoughtful curriculum design and open dialogue, not by resorting to bans that stifle intellectual curiosity and create a chilling effect on open discourse. Our position is not about exposing students to potentially harmful material; it's about empowering them to become discerning thinkers capable of navigating complex issues. <br><br>In closing, we stand firmly against the motion to ban books in schools. Censoring literature, even selectively, sets a dangerous precedent that undermines intellectual freedom, hinders the development of critical thinking skills, and ultimately limits students' ability to engage empathetically with diverse perspectives. We believe in the power of education to guide, not restrict, and we trust our students to engage responsibly with challenging material when given the necessary tools and support.  Let us nurture a love of learning, a spirit of inquiry, and an unwavering commitment to intellectual freedom within our schools. Thank you. <br>
