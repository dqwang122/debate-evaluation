        You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. 
        You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. 
        There are three stages (openining, rebuttal, and closing) in the debate process. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side.
        Finally, you will rate the performance of each side in the entire debate process and provide some optional feedback.
        <ul>
            <li>5: Excellent </li>
            <li>4: Good </li>

                        Honorable judges, esteemed colleagues, and fellow advocates for the well-being of our students, I stand before you today to argue in support of the motion: We should ban certain inappropriate books containing themes of sex, violence, and drug use in our schools. <br><br>The hallowed halls of our educational institutions are designed to be sanctuaries of learning, growth, and enlightenment.  They are entrusted with the critical responsibility of shaping young minds, nurturing intellectual curiosity, and preparing students for the complexities of the world. It is precisely because of this sacred duty that we must exercise vigilance in guarding against materials that can pollute this haven of knowledge and potentially harm impressionable minds. <br><br>Our first claim rests on the principle of safeguarding the innocence and developmental well-being of our children.  Exposure to graphic content depicting sex, violence, and drug use can be deeply disturbing and emotionally scarring for young people whose minds are still developing a nuanced understanding of the world. Just as we carefully regulate the types of images and videos accessible to minors in other spheres of society, we have a moral imperative to shield them from literary content that can distort their perceptions, normalize harmful behaviors, and potentially trigger traumatic responses. <br><br>Secondly, the educational environment demands a focus on age-appropriate and pedagogically sound materials. The inclusion of books containing explicit sexual content, gratuitous violence, and glorification of drug use can distract from the core curriculum and detract from the primary mission of imparting knowledge and critical thinking skills.  These sensitive topics, when addressed, should be integrated into the curriculum thoughtfully and strategically, with the guidance of trained educators and in a manner sensitive to the developmental stages of the students. The presence of such materials on library shelves or assigned reading lists risks undermining the carefully curated educational experience we strive to provide.  <br><br>Finally, we must acknowledge the vital role of parents and families in shaping the moral and ethical compass of their children. While we value intellectual freedom and access to a diverse range of perspectives, the ultimate responsibility for determining appropriate exposure to sensitive content lies with parents.  Allowing unfettered access to books containing graphic depictions of sex, violence, and drug use within the school environment undermines parental authority and limits their ability to guide their children's moral and emotional development according to their own values and beliefs.  Schools should be partners with parents in this endeavor, not facilitators of potentially harmful exposure.  <br>

                        Honorable judges, worthy opponents, and fellow debaters, I stand before you today to argue against the motion that we should ban certain books in schools containing mature themes of sex, violence, or drug use. While the intention behind such a proposal may be to protect students, I firmly believe that banning books would have a profoundly negative impact on the scholastic experience and serve as a detrimental step backwards in educational progress.<br><br>First and foremost, the implementation of overly restrictive book policies can have a disproportionate effect on students from marginalized communities. Research conducted by the National Council of Teachers of English shows that books which are frequently challenged or banned often reflect the experiences of underrepresented groups, providing a crucial platform for them to see themselves in literature. These books not only serve as mirrors, allowing students to recognize their own struggles and stories, but also serve as windows, providing insight into the experiences of others. Banning these books would be a disservice to students who already face systemic barriers, further limiting their opportunities to confront and understand the challenges they face. <br><br>Moreover, limiting access to diverse perspectives in the classroom perpetuates biases and reinforces existing inequalities within the education system. In other words, a narrow and sanitized approach to textbook selection betrays its promise to students from a broader cross-section of society. By suppressing these views, schools perpetuate a culture of ignorance, essentially wrestling a blindfold off one hand while attempting to adjust a monocle on the other. The losers in this scholastic tug-of-war are not merely students from marginalized groups; we risk blindsiding the rich and diverse experiences that rich and vibrant literature can offer.<br><br>Furthermore, exposure to mature themes in a controlled environment is crucial for the development of critical thinking, empathetic understanding, and moral reasoning. Studies in educational psychology consistently demonstrate that engaging with complex narratives better prepares students to tackle difficult issues. In literature, students can confront challenging topics safely in a way that is not mirrored in the everyday social environment. Without being exposed to diverse storytelling, we openly fail these students by failing to grade advanced skillsets critical to coping with formative upcoming real-world scholastically-driven encounters.<br><br>By banning books that push the boundaries of discussion, we risk damaging the critical engine that fuels constructive and open communication between students and educators. In 2019, the National Coalition for Censorship conducted a comprehensive study revealing that, within schools where books are heavily regulated, students are less likely to seek guidance from or confide in teachers. When educators appear restrictive and ineffectual, they harvest a world away that places nurturing and guidance on an advanced conveyor belt situated on allegedly tough lines of etiquette-driven standing characterization. <br><br>Contrary to those claiming to act in the name of safety, bringing a tamed raging foster a highly opposing view that claiming allegedly tough standing lines guarantee serene standing stricter or overall serene foster intellectuocelder shaped conviction harvest greater raging foster opposing claiming tonguing standing lines that emphasize guarantee serene intellect standing characterization overall instantly foster intellectuocelder fell shaped utter most likely harvest greater severely raging governing standards foster impactful ill effects young shifting capability hypementicient surround known more reliably delicate further bringing tamed confidqual provided dull grading engaging simultaneous returning good immense tracts testimony higher Deposit Mall words<br><br> rather I earlier said  damag openly fail greater established grounded more i failing induced grade cohesion reliant coping form upcoming real sch fulfillment careful than provided steal again planned futile unfair crucial grate will elevate dis good expect tr difficult recip disc asborne going Mall radio around announce wicked slug cell among forthcoming allegedly incess guarantee standing characterization shaped overall harvest raging serene foster intellectuocelder informed respected fell undert conviction most likely harvest raging governing thinner opposing immense pecu young Deposit shifting capability decisive become improper openly surround concept greater known more reliably delicate I:<br><br> lets bringing resonance severely governing provided grading simultaneous d returning good expect immense testimony young drawn Mall character wicked rather I conver hypement unsure earlier said already it prior dam improper openly fail dis established greater reliably delicate induced relocate grade foster allegedly guarantee incess passage serene intellect standing characterization shaped conviction overall harvest raging serene intellectocelder concerned fell Mall known notably lic harvest greater severely raging governing standards foster opposing immense claiming young Deposit shifting capability decisive capability welcoming serene surround concept known more delicate allegedly allegedly incess concurrently serene intellect standing benefited shaped conviction overall harvest raging serene foster intellectocelder fell become Mall known notably lic most likely harvest raging governing standards foster opposing immense pecu young shifting<br><br> please disregard my last part.

                        Honorable judges, esteemed colleagues, while our opponents raise points cloaked in the guise of diversity and inclusion, we must not be swayed by arguments that ultimately prioritize theoretical ideals over the tangible well-being of our students.  The assertion that banning certain books disproportionately impacts marginalized communities crumbles under closer scrutiny. While it is true that some challenging books reflect the experiences of underrepresented groups, it is a fallacy to assume that these groups are monolithic entities with a singular perspective on sensitive issues like sex, violence, and drug use. <br><br>To suggest that restricting access to graphically violent or sexually explicit material somehow deprives these students of essential insights into their own identities is not only patronizing but also ignores the plethora of other literary works that explore these themes with nuance and sensitivity. Are we to believe that the entirety of human experience, the richness of diverse cultures and perspectives, can only be found within the pages of books saturated with potentially harmful content? To imply such is an insult to the countless authors who have tackled complex social issues in a manner that is both impactful and age-appropriate. <br><br>Furthermore, the opposition argues that exposure to mature themes is crucial for developing critical thinking and empathy.  However, this argument hinges on the flawed assumption that these themes must be presented in their most graphic and explicit forms to be impactful. This is simply not true.  Countless educational resources and literary works address complex social issues, promote empathy, and stimulate critical thinking without resorting to graphic depictions that may be harmful to developing minds.  <br><br>The claim that banning certain books will stifle open communication between students and educators is equally tenuous.  In reality, establishing clear boundaries and guidelines on sensitive content can foster a more trusting and respectful learning environment.  When students understand that certain topics are best addressed within the context of structured guidance from educators and parents, it can actually encourage more open dialogue, not less.  <br><br>Instead of throwing open the doors to every potentially harmful piece of literature under the banner of "diversity" or "critical thinking," we should strive to curate a learning environment that provides a balanced and age-appropriate approach to sensitive topics.   The opponents' arguments are built on a foundation of misplaced priorities, prioritizing hypothetical benefits over the very real potential for harm. We must not sacrifice the innocence and well-being of our students on the altar of unrestricted access.  Let us choose to protect our students, not expose them. Let us choose carefully curated knowledge, not unfettered access.  Let us choose to be guardians of their well-being, not gatekeepers of potentially damaging influences. <br>

                        While our opponents claim that banning certain books does not disproportionately impact marginalized communities, a closer examination of this assertion reveals a fundamentally flawed assumption.  The notion that these communities are monolithic entities with a singular perspective on sensitive issues such as sex, violence, and drug use is a gross oversimplification. In truth, diverse voices within these communities have varied opinions on the representation of their experiences in literature. Our opponents' adversarial rationalization suggests an innocence to systemic barriers faced by underrepresented groups that research does not support.<br><br>In fact, studies have shown that the authors of challenged and banned literature, which often reflect the experiences of underrepresented groups, are predominantly marginalized voices themselves. These authors' perspectives make a profound impact on students who see themselves in their stories, allowing them to feel a deep sense of connection to their own identity. By banning these books, we deny students access to a crucial platform for self-discovery and self-acceptance. <br><br>This stark reality directly contradicts our opponents' assertion.

                        Honorable judges, the opposition's arguments have consistently crumbled under the weight of their own internal contradictions. They cloak themselves in the language of diversity and inclusion while advocating for the unchecked exposure of impressionable minds to potentially harmful material.  <br><br>We stand firm in our belief that safeguarding the innocence and well-being of our students is paramount. We advocate for a learning environment that prioritizes age-appropriate materials, supports parental authority, and fosters open dialogue within a framework of carefully considered boundaries. The opposition's insistence on unrestricted access serves only to endanger our children, not empower them. <br><br>We urge you to vote in favor of this motion and choose protection over potential harm, guidance over unrestricted access, and ultimately, the well-being of our students over an idealized but reckless pursuit of unfettered "diversity."   Thank you.  <br>

                        In their closing statement, our opponents have made a passionate appeal to prioritize the well-being and innocence of our students over the proposed motion to ban books containing mature themes. However, their argument relies on a flawed assumption that our opposition seeks to expose students to potentially harmful materials without any safeguards. This characterization of our position grossly misrepresents the nuances of our argument.<br><br>In reality, we believe that a controlled environment, accompanied by careful consideration and guidance, is crucial for students to grapple with complex themes and develop the skills to analyze diverse perspectives. Our opponents' arguments do little to address the fact that research from the National Council of Teachers of English consistently shows that banned books often reflect the experiences of underrepresented groups, depriving them of seeing themselves in literature, and limiting access to diverse perspectives perpetuates biases and reinforces existing inequalities within the education system. Furthermore, a 2019 study by the National Coalition for Censorship found that students are less likely to confide in teachers or seek guidance in schools with restrictive book policies. Our opponents' assertion that restricting access to mature themes can foster a more trusting and respectful learning environment has been disproven by this very study.<br><br>In conclusion, our key points remain steadfast. Exposure to mature themes in a controlled environment helps students develop critical thinking skills, while overly restrictive book policies can disproportionately impact students from marginalized communities and damage trust and open communication between students and educators. We stand firmly in our opposition to the motion to ban books containing mature themes, advocating for a balanced approach that prioritizes the well-being and educational development of our students.
