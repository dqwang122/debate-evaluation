                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss the crucial role that processed foods should play in sustainable food systems. To ensure a productive conversation, let's define our terms. "Processed foods" encompass any transformation beyond basic cleaning or cutting, including preservation and packaging. A "sustainable food system," as we define it, minimizes environmental harm, is economically sound, and provides nutritional security for all, without jeopardizing future generations.<br><br>When evaluating our arguments today, we should prioritize those that demonstrably improve food security and environmental sustainability, especially for our most vulnerable populations.<br><br>With that in mind, I will present three key arguments demonstrating why processed foods are not just relevant, but essential, to building sustainable food systems.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly enhance food security by extending shelf life and drastically reducing waste. Unlike fresh produce, which spoils rapidly, processed foods offer a longer shelf life. This extended usability reduces spoilage, making food available for longer periods and in more locations. *Food Safety*, a trusted resource on food-related topics, reports that studies show about 50 percent of consumer food waste can be prevented by extending the shelf life of the food product. This is particularly critical in regions with limited access to fresh food or unreliable supply chains. Moreover, *a 2019 study* highlights that wastage of processed fruits and vegetables is approximately 14% lower than that of fresh produce. This demonstrates the power of processing to minimize waste across the supply chain.<br><br>Second, processed foods are often more accessible and affordable than fresh produce, especially for individuals with limited time for meal preparation, disabilities that make cooking difficult, or those living in areas with limited transportation options. While we acknowledge concerns about the nutritional profile of some processed foods, it's important to recognize that they provide essential calories and nutrients to individuals who would otherwise struggle to obtain sufficient nourishment. According to *The Annie E. Casey Foundation in 2024*, meals rich in vegetables, fruits, fish, and nuts are, on average, $1.50 more expensive per day than diets rich in processed foods, meats, and refined grains. Furthermore, *WebMD* notes that U.S. food producers have been fortifying foods since the 1920s to prevent nutrition-related illnesses.<br><br>Third, processing enables the utilization of agricultural byproducts and waste streams, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. As highlighted in *a 2021 study in PMC*, extrusion processing can be an excellent avenue for the utilization of these by-products in foods.<br><br>Therefore, processed foods are not the antithesis of a sustainable food system; they are, in fact, a critical tool for achieving it, and should be considered by individuals, and supported by policymakers.<br>***<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is detrimental to overall sustainability due to their environmental impact, adverse health effects, and the hindering of more sustainable alternatives. We define **processed foods** as foods altered from their natural state through methods like canning, freezing, drying, or the addition of additives . A **sustainable food system** is one that provides food security and nutrition for current generations without compromising the ability of future generations to do the same, being environmentally sound, economically viable, and socially equitable .<br><br>Our judging criteria prioritize **holistic sustainability**, meaning the judge should favor the side that best promotes environmental health, human well-being, and the long-term viability of food systems. Arguments favoring processed foods should be rejected if they significantly harm any of these core pillars, even if offering short-term gains in areas like affordability.<br><br>First, increasing reliance on processed foods exacerbates environmental degradation. Processed food production relies on resource-intensive agriculture, contributing to deforestation and high greenhouse gas emissions . For example, the production of ultra-processed foods contributes heavily to waste and emissions, undermining environmental sustainability . Studies show that processed food production significantly harms the environment through land degradation and increased food waste . This reliance on intensive farming methods and non-biodegradable packaging further strains our planet's resources . Thus, the environmental costs associated with processed foods outweigh any perceived benefits in a sustainable system.<br><br>Second, a greater role for processed foods undermines human health. These foods are often high in sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats, leading to increased rates of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes . Research indicates that ultra-processed foods are particularly concerning due to their association with numerous health issues . Increased consumption of processed foods is linked to higher risks of obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. Specifically, ultra-processed foods are associated with numerous health issues . Therefore, promoting processed foods undermines the goal of creating healthy, resilient populations.<br><br>Third, prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of more sustainable alternatives. Focusing on processed foods distracts from investing in regenerative agriculture, local food systems, and plant-based diets, which offer long-term benefits for both the environment and human health . Sustainable food systems promote healthy alternatives to processed foods, emphasizing local, fresh produce . Specifically, these systems reduce environmental impact and support community health by growing and consuming locally sourced foods . Prioritizing processed foods diverts resources and attention from more sustainable and beneficial practices, hindering the transition to a truly sustainable food system.<br><br>In conclusion, increasing the role of processed foods in sustainable food systems is counterproductive. It worsens environmental problems, harms human health, and impedes the development of genuinely sustainable alternatives. We urge the judge to oppose this motion and support a future where food systems prioritize health, environment, and long-term viability.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate the opponent's perspective, but we believe they've presented an incomplete picture. We'll clarify key definitions and demonstrate how processed foods are crucial for a truly sustainable food system, especially when considering the needs of vulnerable populations.<br><br>First, let's address the definition of processed foods. The opponent defines it too narrowly. Our definition includes basic preservation and packaging techniques. These steps are vital for reducing waste and extending shelf life, which are essential for sustainability. It's an oversimplification to exclude these processes, as they directly impact food availability and reduce overall waste in the supply chain. According to *KHNI*, extending the shelf life of food products has rapidly emerged as a powerful tool to support and promote sustainability .<br><br>Second, we reinforce the core principles of a sustainable food system. It minimizes environmental harm, is economically sound, and provides nutritional security for all, without jeopardizing future generations. Arguments that improve food security and environmental sustainability, especially for our most vulnerable populations, should be prioritized. These are the metrics to evaluate our arguments.<br><br>Third, processed foods significantly enhance food security. They extend shelf life and drastically reduce waste. As *the BBC reported in 2021*, ultra-processed foods can help reduce emissions because they are made to last longer, so we're less likely to waste them . While the opponent may point to wastage of processed fruits and vegetables being approximately 14% lower than that of fresh produce, we must consider the broader impact.<br><br>Fourth, processed foods are often more accessible and affordable, especially for those with limited time, disabilities, or transportation challenges. Meals rich in fresh foods are significantly more expensive, particularly in food deserts. *The Food Revolution Network* points out that food subsidies have caused the price of processed foods and industrial meat to decrease by 20-30% over the last four decades, while the price of fruits and vegetables has increased by 40% .<br><br>Fifth, processing enables the utilization of agricultural byproducts and waste streams, transforming what would otherwise be discarded into valuable resources. This contributes to resource efficiency. By adopting a circular economy approach, by-product utilization in agriculture will flourish. Rather than treating by-products as wastes, there is a growing trend to integrate them into the production process.<br><br>Now, let's address the opponent's concerns. We acknowledge that the production of *some* processed foods can have a significant environmental footprint. However, advancements in sustainable processing and packaging offer opportunities to dramatically reduce these impacts. For example, *ScienceDirect* highlights that technologies like microwaves, ultrasound, and nonthermal plasma are rapidly being adapted by the food industry to save production resources and improve food quality .<br><br>They also claim processed foods undermine human health. While *Harvard Health* notes in a 2024 review that ultra-processed foods are linked to higher risks of certain health issues, they also acknowledge that some ultra-processed whole-grain breads, breakfast cereals, and yogurts were associated with a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease .<br><br>Finally, they argue that prioritizing processed foods hinders the development of more sustainable alternatives. This is a false dilemma. We can and should invest in both.<br><br>Therefore, processed foods are an important key to food sustainability.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. A steam judges ladies and gentlemen. The opponent's rebuttals contains several flaws. We will address their inaccurate definition of processed foods. They're inadequate consideration of long-term sustainability. They're overestimation of processed foods impact on food security. They're misrepresentation of affordability their exaggeration of byproduct utilization. They're down playing of environmental impacts. They're selective highlighting of health effects and their creation of a false dilemma regarding sustainable alternatives. First the opposition attempts to broaden the definition of processed foods to include basic preservation and packaging one. However this definition is overly broad and deviates from the common understanding and expert consensus. Established food science organizations. Such as the fda and usda define processed foods more specifically. As foods altered from their natural state. Through methods like canning freezing drying or the addition of additives. The affirmative is broad definition of effectively encompasses nearly all foods. Rendering the debate meaningless and preventing us from addressing the real issues at hand. Therefore their subsequent arguments built upon this flaw definition lack of solid foundation. Second while the affirmative prioritizes short-term food security. We must reiterate the importance of holistic sustainability. A truly sustainable food system considers not only immediate needs but also the long-term health and environmental consequences. Studies consistently demonstrate the detrimental long-term health impacts of diets high in processed foods. Including increased risks of obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore the environmental costs of processed food production such as resource depletion and pollution. Undermine any short-term gains in food security. This shows that even if processed foods offer immediate benefits they compromised the long-term viability of our food systems. Negating their supposed sustainability. The claim that processed foods significantly enhance food security is overstated. While processed foods can extend shelf life the affirmatives reliance on cage and i. An industry source introduces bias. Well one could cherry pick reports that ultra-processed foods can help reduce emissions as pointed out by the bbc. The overall impact of ultra-processed food production contributes heavily to waste and emissions as the soil association rightly highlights 3 5. Improved supply chain management and investment in local food systems offer more sustainable and resilient solutions to food security challenges. Thus relying on processed foods for food security is a band-aid solution compared to more comprehensive sustainable approaches. Fourth the affordability of processed foods is often a result of market distortions caused by subsidies. As they point out by citing the food revolution network. These subsidies artificially lower the price of processed foods while simultaneously increasing the price of fresh fruits and vegetables. When considering the long-term health care costs associated with diets high in processed foods? The true cost is significantly higher. By not addressing the financial burden associated with healthcare. The affirmative is failing to offer a truly sustainable solution. This exposes the illusion of affordability. As the long-term costs outweigh any perceived short-term savings. Fifth while processing can enable the utilization of agricultural by-products. The overall impact of processed food production still leads to significant waste. Simpler and more sustainable methods such as composting and using by-products for animal feed offer more effective ways to minimize waste and maximize resource utilization.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">As we conclude this debate, it's clear the core disagreement centers on the role of processed foods in a sustainable future. While the opposition paints a grim picture, we advocate for a pragmatic understanding. This includes recognizing essential processes like preservation and packaging, vital for minimizing waste and ensuring broad food access.<br><br>Consider the single parent working multiple jobs or the senior with mobility issues. For these individuals, affordable, nutritious, and often processed foods are indispensable. Our vision of a sustainable food system isn't just about idealistic environmental standards; it's about ensuring everyone, especially the vulnerable, has access to nourishment.<br><br>Our opponents overstate the health and environmental concerns. It's crucial to remember that processed foods are not a monolith. Innovation and reformulation can lead to healthier options with reduced environmental impact. Their arguments fail to account for progress, clinging to outdated notions. For example, *a 2023 report by the Food Processing Suppliers Association* highlights advancements in processing technologies that significantly reduce energy consumption and waste .<br><br>Therefore, the choice is clear. Support a system that acknowledges the realities of modern life, embraces innovation, and prioritizes accessibility alongside sustainability. Choose a future where no one is left behind. Processed foods, when produced and consumed responsibly, are not the enemy. They are a crucial component of a sustainable and equitable food future for all. As *research from the World Food Programme in 2022* indicates, processed foods play a critical role in emergency food relief, providing stable and nutritious options in crisis situations . This underscores their importance in ensuring food security globally.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the core question of whether processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems. We firmly believe that increasing the role of processed foods is detrimental to overall sustainability. The first battleground centered on the definition of processed foods. While the opposition attempted to broaden the definition to include basic preservation. We maintain that this is an overly broad interpretation that deviates from expert consensus one. Established food science organizations such as the fda and usda define processed foods more specifically. By including nearly all foods under their definition. The opposition of voids addressing the real harms of highly processed foods. This leads us to the second key battle. The scope of sustainability. We have consistently argued for holistic sustainability. Which considers not only immediate needs but also long-term health and environmental consequences? The opposition's focus on short-term gains is myopic. As studies consistently demonstrate the detrimental long-term health impacts of diets high in processed foods. Including increased risks of obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease undermine any short-term gains in food security 6. Even if processed foods can extend shelf life and enhance food security 5. As the opposition argued relying on them is merely a band-aid solution compared to more comprehensive sustainable approaches such as improving supply chain management and investing in local food systems. Moreover the affordability of processed foods is often an illusion created by market distortions caused by subsidies. The true cost including long-term health care expenses is significantly higher. Therefore we urge you to consider the values at.<br><br></div>
