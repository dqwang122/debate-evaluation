                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We're here today to discuss a critical issue: the books our children encounter in schools. To ensure a productive discussion, let's define "inappropriate books." We're talking about books that contain graphic depictions or promote sexual activity, violence, or illegal drug use. This definition applies to students under 18 in publicly funded K-12 schools within the United States. It's important to acknowledge that what constitutes "inappropriate" is determined by community standards and established legal precedents concerning obscenity and age appropriateness.<br><br>Our guiding principle is simple: the safety and well-being of our students. The most critical factor is whether these books contribute to a secure and supportive learning environment.<br><br>First, schools have a fundamental responsibility to foster a safe learning environment by removing inappropriate books. A safe learning environment is essential for students' well-being and academic success. Removing books containing inappropriate content, such as explicit depictions of violence, drug use, or sexual activity, directly contributes to a safer environment by minimizing exposure to potentially harmful influences. This proactive measure aligns with the school's duty to protect students from elements that could disrupt their learning or negatively impact their development. It's akin to building a fence around a playground – we do it to protect children from potential dangers. Studies by *PMC* show that children exposed to violence may exhibit neurological changes, impacting memory and self-regulation . This underscores the importance of creating a safe environment, as these changes can directly hinder a child's ability to learn and succeed academically.<br><br>Second, schools need guidelines to ensure the books are age-appropriate for students. Age appropriateness is critical to education. Schools need a framework to assess if a book's content is suitable for a student's maturity level and developmental stage. Without such guidelines, students may be exposed to material that is confusing, disturbing, or emotionally damaging. Establishing age-appropriate guidelines ensures that the books available in schools align with the cognitive and emotional capabilities of the students, fostering a more effective and supportive learning environment. It's like giving a child a complex calculus problem before they've learned basic arithmetic. It's not only confusing but potentially discouraging. *American University* reported in *2024* a sharp rise in the number of contested books in schools that were considered to be too mature for students .<br><br>Finally, schools should shield students from content glorifying self-harm or suicide. Such content can normalize and promote dangerous behaviors. Protecting children helps prevent tragic outcomes. Schools have a moral imperative to shield students from such material, as it can normalize and promote dangerous behaviors. Protecting children from this type of content helps prevent tragic outcomes and reinforces the message that self-harm and suicide are never acceptable solutions. *PMC* reported in *2023* that exposure to content that depicts illegal or psychologically maladaptive behavior, including self-harm, should be minimized, reported, and removed . Shielding students from this content is not censorship, but a necessary step in protecting their mental health and well-being.<br><br>In conclusion, by proactively addressing these issues and supporting policies that prioritize student safety through the removal of inappropriate books, we create a better, safer learning environment for our students, which is our paramount goal. I urge you to join us in this crucial endeavor and engage in further discussion and action within your communities. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue against the motion that certain "inappropriate" books, defined as those containing depictions of sex, violence, or drug use, should be banned from schools. We contend that such bans constitute censorship, which we define as the suppression or prohibition of speech or expression considered objectionable.<br><br>Our judging criteria is upholding intellectual freedom and educational value. We believe the side that best demonstrates how their position fosters intellectual freedom, promotes critical thinking, and provides students with access to diverse perspectives while minimizing potential harms, should win the debate. We argue that banning books fails this criteria, leading to a less informed and less tolerant student body.<br><br>First, banning books limits intellectual freedom and critical thinking. Restricting access to diverse perspectives stifles students' ability to analyze complex issues and form their own opinions. Censorship undermines the educational process by preventing students from engaging with challenging ideas and developing critical thinking skills. Research indicates that intellectual freedom, encompassing the freedom to read, express, and know, is vital for a well-rounded education . Opponents of book bans argue that restricting information and discouraging freedom of thought undermine one of the primary functions of education: teaching students how to think for themselves . By shielding students from controversial topics, we hinder their ability to navigate the complexities of the real world and prepare them for informed participation in a democratic society. Therefore, banning books undermines the core educational mission.<br><br>Second, book bans disproportionately affect marginalized voices and perspectives. Challenges to books often target works by or about people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other underrepresented groups, further marginalizing these communities . This creates a biased learning environment where certain voices are silenced and students are denied the opportunity to learn about diverse experiences and perspectives. For example, challenges to books often cite violence or religious viewpoints , demonstrating a tendency to suppress content that challenges dominant norms. This censorship not only harms marginalized students by erasing their experiences but also deprives all students of the opportunity to develop empathy and understanding for different cultures and identities. Thus, banning these books perpetuates harmful biases and undermines efforts to create inclusive and equitable schools.<br><br>Third, alternative approaches, such as parental guidance and age-appropriate discussions, are more effective than outright bans. Open dialogue and critical evaluation of materials, guided by parents and educators, foster media literacy and critical thinking skills. Instead of shielding students from potentially sensitive content, we should empower them to engage with it critically and responsibly. These approaches teach students how to analyze information, identify bias, and form their own informed opinions . According to the American Library Association, challenges to books often cite concerns about violence or religious viewpoints . Instead of banning books, schools can create diverse, inclusive curricula and promote open discussions about challenging topics. By fostering critical thinking and media literacy, we equip students with the tools they need to navigate complex issues and make informed decisions.<br><br>In conclusion, we stand against the banning of "inappropriate" books in schools. Such bans limit intellectual freedom, disproportionately affect marginalized voices, and are less effective than alternative approaches. We urge you to uphold intellectual freedom and educational value by rejecting this motion.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The opposition's arguments miss the central point: safeguarding children within our schools. We will demonstrate why our stance is not censorship, why student safety is paramount, and why their proposed solutions are inadequate.<br><br>First, let's dismantle the false dichotomy that banning inappropriate books equates to censorship. This isn't about suppressing ideas; it's about responsible curation of content suitable for young minds. Think of it as protecting a playground from hazards – we aren't banning play, we're ensuring a safe environment. *ACE*, the Association of College and Research Libraries, clarifies in *a 2024 publication, titled "The definition of book banning"*, that book banning involves removing or censoring books due to objections to their content. Our approach is more nuanced; we aim to provide age-appropriate materials, not stifle intellectual exploration.<br><br>Second, the opposition argues that banning books disproportionately affects marginalized voices. While we deeply value diverse perspectives, the well-being of students remains our foremost concern. Removing graphically explicit content isn't about silencing voices; it's about acknowledging and respecting age-appropriateness. Diverse content can still be accessible, but with careful consideration of its suitability for young audiences. The key is that the proposed definition of "inappropriate books" focuses on graphic content rather than the identity of the author or the subject matter.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims we limit intellectual freedom. However, unrestricted access doesn't automatically equate to understanding or benefit. Shielding children from harmful content isn't limiting their future intellectual growth; it's ensuring their psychological well-being today. According to *a 2013 report by the American Psychological Association*, media's influence on children's psychosocial development is profound, so guidance on age-appropriate use is important . There is a necessity to protect children's psychological development by only teaching them appropriate content.<br><br>Fourth, they suggest parental guidance and open discussions are better than bans. While these are valuable tools, they aren't always sufficient. Not all students have supportive parents, and the impact of some content extends beyond a simple discussion. According to *a 2021 study published in JAMA Pediatrics*, exposure to certain content, such as that glorifying self-harm, can normalize these behaviors in teenagers . These approaches should work in conjunction with curating inappropriate content.<br><br>Fifth, let's address their judging criteria: upholding intellectual freedom and educational value. We concur, but argue that curating books creates a safer learning environment that ultimately enhances intellectual freedom and educational value. As *the National Education Association* stated in *a 2023 report on school safety*, a safe and secure environment is of the utmost importance for schools, ensuring the well-being of students, teachers, and staff, and playing a crucial role in academic performance and teacher satisfaction . Students cannot learn effectively when they don't feel safe and supported.<br><br>Finally, let's reiterate that "inappropriate content" is explicitly defined. For example, *the American Academy of Pediatrics* provides guidelines on media use for children, explaining that materials should align with children's cognitive and motor skill development at different ages . Similarly, schools can establish clear guidelines for age-appropriate content, ensuring that students are exposed to material that is both educational and suitable for their developmental stage.<br><br>In summary, our position ensures a safer, more supportive learning environment. Protecting our children's well-being is the foundation of education.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. A steam judges ladies and gentlemen. The affirmatives rebuttal contains five critical flaws. The redefinition of censorship. They're over emphasis on safety at the expense of diverse perspectives. They're underestimation of children's capacity for critical thinking. They're dismissal of parental guidance. And they're unsupported claim that banning books enhances intellectual freedom. First the affirmative attempts to redefine banning books as responsible curation. But this is simply a euphemism for censorship. Censorship by definition is the suppression or prohibition of ideas and information that are considered objectionable. Removing books from schools based on their content regardless of the justification. Fit squarely within this definition the american library association. Has track challenges to books for decades and consistently highlights the harm of censorship. In limiting access to diverse perspectives. This so-called curation. Inevitably involves suppressing certain viewpoints especially those of marginalized communities. And restricting student's ability to engage with a wide range of ideas. The impact of this censorship is that it leaves students less informed. Less tolerant and less prepared for the complexities of the real world. While we agree that student well-being is important it should not come at the cost of limiting exposure to diverse perspectives. The affirmative creates a false dichotomy. My suggesting that we must choose between safety and intellectual freedom. In reality it is possible to protect students and provide them with access to a wide range of voices and experiences exposure to diverse literature fosters empathy understanding. And critical thinking for. The affirmative claims that they are only removing graphic content. But this definition is often subjective. And can be used to target books that deal with difficult topics in a responsible and age appropriate way. Furthermore this argument does not protect marginalized students who might need the content of the books being removed. We cannot protect some students while leaving others behind. The affirmative underestimates children's capacity for critical thinking. Shielding children from harmful content. Can actually hinder their intellectual and emotional development. Engaging with challenging ideas even at a young age. Help students develop critical thinking skills and learn to navigate complex issues 5. By censoring books we deprive students of the opportunity to grapple with difficult topics analyze different perspectives. And form their own informed opinions. This overprotection can leave them unprepared for the realities of the world. Unless able to cope with challenging situations. They do not have data regarding the risks of over protection. We acknowledge their data regarding self-harm but point out that we must teach students coping mechanisms for the real world. Fourth the affirmative dismisses parental guidance as insufficient. But this overlooks the crucial role that parents play in shaping their children's values and beliefs. While we acknowledge that not all parents are equally equipped or willing to guide their children's reading choices. Schools should work to empower parents not replace them. Furthermore. Curating inappropriate content also limits the ability for open discussion with parents. If children do not know about the content. They will not know to reach out for help. If this information is readily available. It can be discussed and the schools and parents can work together. Finally the affirmative claims that curating books creates a safer learning environment that ultimately enhances intellectual freedom and educational value.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let's be absolutely clear: this isn't about censorship, it's about responsible curation to ensure a safe learning environment. The opposition tries to frame this as a battle between censorship and intellectual freedom, falsely claiming you can't have both.<br><br>First, their argument hinges on "parental guidance." But what about the students who lack supportive parents? We aren't dismissing parental involvement; we're addressing the gaps and acknowledging the realities some children face. Unrestricted access to content that glorifies self-harm normalizes dangerous behaviors. *A JAMA Pediatrics study* confirms a correlation between children consuming content that glorifies self-harm and the normalization of these behaviors. Our approach acknowledges this reality and seeks to protect vulnerable children.<br><br>Second, they claim we harm marginalized voices. This is simply untrue. We are protecting *all* children from graphic content that is inappropriate for their age. Diversity is crucial, and we can absolutely maintain it without sacrificing student safety and well-being.<br><br>Finally, our position offers something theirs cannot: a safe, supportive learning environment, *which in turn*, enhances intellectual freedom. It's not an either/or situation. As *education expert Dr. Sarah Wilson* argues, a safe environment is foundational for effective learning and exploration. Think about your own children or loved ones in the classroom. Wouldn't you want to ensure their safety and well-being?<br><br>Let’s prioritize our children. A vote for us is a vote for safety, for well-being, and ultimately, for a better educational environment for all. Thank you.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the core principles of censorship versus curation, the balance between student safety and intellectual freedom, and the most effective methods for fostering critical thinking in our schools.<br><br>The opposition attempts to reframe banning books as "responsible curation" . However, regardless of intent, the effect remains censorship: the suppression of ideas . Even well-intentioned curation can become censorship if certain viewpoints are excluded, especially those of marginalized communities. Our opponents create a false dichotomy by suggesting we must choose between safety and intellectual freedom. In reality, these values are not mutually exclusive; a well-rounded education necessitates both . Exposure to diverse literature fosters empathy and critical thinking . The affirmative's subjective definition of "graphic content" can easily target books addressing important social issues, silencing marginalized voices . We believe that shielding children from challenging topics hinders their ability to develop critical thinking skills .<br><br>We recognize the importance of protecting children from genuinely harmful content. However, the vast majority of challenged books do not fall into this category. The alternative isn't reckless exposure but context and age-appropriate discussions . We point out that alternative coping mechanisms exist for real world .<br><br>While the opposition dismisses parental guidance as insufficient, parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's values. Schools should empower parents, not replace them. Banning books also limits the opportunity for open discussion and critical engagement . Schools should implement programs promoting media literacy, helping students navigate challenging content responsibly .<br><br>This debate boils down to safety versus freedom.<br><br></div>
