                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that developed countries should impose a fat tax, defined as a tax or excise duty placed on foods with high levels of saturated fat, sugar, or salt to discourage consumption and improve public health.<br><br>Our judging criteria is utilitarianism: maximizing public health and societal welfare. We believe the side that demonstrably maximizes overall public health outcomes and minimizes the societal costs associated with diet-related diseases in developed countries should prevail.<br><br>First, a fat tax reduces the consumption of unhealthy foods. The core mechanism is simple: by increasing the price of unhealthy options, consumers are incentivized to choose healthier alternatives. Studies by the Imperial College Business School show that taxes on foods high in fat, salt, or sugar  demonstrably reduce their sale, purchase, and consumption . For instance, a 2012 study highlighted that a 20% tax on sugary drinks could reduce obesity levels by 3.5% in the US . Furthermore, a US study found that a 35% tax on sugar-sweetened drinks led to a 26% decline in sales within a canteen . These figures aren't just abstract percentages; they represent tangible shifts in dietary habits, moving populations away from harmful foods and towards healthier choices. Therefore, by making the unhealthy choice more expensive, a fat tax effectively steers consumers towards better dietary habits, leading to improved public health outcomes.<br><br>Second, a fat tax generates revenue for vital public health initiatives. This isn't simply about raising money; it's about strategically reinvesting resources to promote healthier lifestyles. The revenue generated can be directly allocated to subsidizing healthy food options, making them more accessible and affordable, particularly for lower-income communities. Moreover, these funds can fuel public education campaigns, raising awareness about the risks of unhealthy diets and promoting informed food choices. As an example, Kerala, India, implemented a 14.5% tax on fast foods sold by branded restaurants. The revenue was intended for public health initiatives, including promoting healthy eating habits . This illustrates the potential for fat tax revenue to be channeled directly into programs that encourage healthier behaviors. Consequently, the revenue generated transforms from a mere tax into a powerful tool for improving public health infrastructure and promoting healthier communities.<br><br>Third, a fat tax addresses the substantial societal costs of obesity and diet-related diseases. Obesity isn't just a personal issue; it's a significant drain on public resources. The Lancet reported that the costs to society resulting from obesity and other diet-related diseases are immense, including health-care costs, sickness absence, welfare payments, and lost tax revenue . These costs are borne by society as a whole, through higher taxes, reduced productivity, and an overburdened healthcare system, as highlighted by the National Institutes of Health . By implementing a fat tax, we are internalizing these costs, making consumers more aware of the true price of their unhealthy choices. The goal is not to punish individuals, but to create a system where the costs associated with unhealthy diets are more accurately reflected in the price of food. Ultimately, this encourages more responsible consumption and reduces the burden on society as a whole.<br><br>In conclusion, a fat tax is a vital tool for promoting public health in developed countries. By reducing the consumption of unhealthy foods, generating revenue for public health initiatives, and addressing the societal costs of obesity, it creates a healthier and more sustainable future for all. We urge you to support this motion.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the proposition that developed countries should impose a fat tax. To ensure clarity, we acknowledge the opposition's definition of a fat tax as a tax on foods high in saturated fat, sugar, or salt, designed to discourage consumption and boost public health. However, our core objection goes beyond this definition.<br><br>First, we challenge the utilitarian argument often used to support fat taxes. While public health is undoubtedly important, it cannot be the only factor guiding policy. A purely utilitarian approach risks trampling individual rights and disproportionately harming vulnerable populations. We believe just policy must balance the well-being of the many with the rights of the individual. We advocate for a rights-based approach, which prioritizes individual autonomy and equal access to resources. Under this framework, a fat tax is problematic because it infringes on the rights of low-income individuals to access affordable nutrition.<br><br>Second, we don't have to guess at the consequences of a fat tax. We can learn from the failure of the Danish experiment. As *PubMed Central* reported in *2013*, Denmark introduced a fat tax in 2011 but repealed it less than 12 months later . Consumers switched to cheaper brands, crossed borders to shop, and the administrative costs were high.<br><br>Third, let's address the central issue: the disproportionate impact of fat taxes on low-income individuals. These taxes unfairly burden those with limited financial resources, making it harder to access necessary calories and nutrition. The opposition often overlooks the regressive nature of fat taxes. Lower-income individuals spend a larger percentage of their income on food and will be disproportionately burdened by these taxes. They may not be able to afford healthier alternatives and could be forced to consume even less nutritious food to stay within their budget. A study in *ScienceDirect* found that even small taxes on groceries, around 4%, significantly increase the risk of food insecurity for low-income families by over 3%, as reported in *2023* . This can exacerbate health inequalities rather than improve public health outcomes, contradicting the stated goal. Instead of expanding healthy choices, fat taxes can restrict the ability of vulnerable populations to afford food, healthy or not, which does not truly promote informed choices.<br><br>Fourth, the idea that a fat tax is a valuable public health tool oversimplifies dietary behavior. Obesity is a multifaceted issue influenced by socioeconomic status, education, and lifestyle choices, which a tax cannot resolve. It penalizes specific food items without addressing the underlying causes of unhealthy diets. Emphasizing personal responsibility, education, and accessible healthy choices is a better approach.<br><br>Finally, fat taxes risk fueling a culture of moral judgment and shame around food, exacerbating anxiety and disordered eating. Creating a punitive atmosphere around food choices can have detrimental effects on mental health and well-being.<br><br>In conclusion, while we acknowledge the importance of promoting public health, we believe that fat taxes are not the answer. They unfairly burden low-income individuals, divert attention from more effective solutions, and risk creating a harmful culture around food. Let us invest in education and accessible resources so that all members of our society can flourish, not through punitive measures, but through empowerment.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains five critical flaws: their rejection of utilitarianism, their misrepresentation of the Danish fat tax experiment, their claim that fat taxes disproportionately harm low-income individuals, their assertion that fat taxes oversimplify dietary behavior, and their concern about creating a culture of moral judgment around food.<br><br>First, they reject utilitarianism, arguing for a "rights-based approach." However, we contend that maximizing public health, the very essence of utilitarianism, inherently protects and promotes individual rights. A healthier population is a more empowered population, better equipped to exercise their rights and contribute to society. Moreover, their "rights-based" approach lacks a concrete framework for measuring policy effectiveness, unlike our utilitarian approach which is focused on public health outcomes .<br><br>Second, they cite the "failure" of the Danish fat tax. However, this is a gross oversimplification. While Denmark repealed the tax, studies from the Oxford Martin Programme on the Future of Food show the tax *did* have a positive impact on the nation’s health . The tax's repeal was due to administrative burdens, political opposition, and cross-border shopping, issues of implementation, not a failure of the underlying principle . Moreover, Kerala, India, implemented a 14.5% tax on fast foods sold by branded restaurants. The revenue was intended for public health initiatives, including promoting healthy eating habits . The results show that the fast food purchase ratio in Kerala decreased by 3.9 percentage points, compared with 9 major cities . This illustrates that a fat tax, when implemented strategically, can be effective.<br><br>Third, they claim fat taxes disproportionately harm low-income individuals. While it's true that lower-income individuals spend a larger percentage of their income on food, this argument ignores the crucial fact that revenue from fat taxes can be directly allocated to subsidizing healthy food options, making them more accessible and affordable, particularly for lower-income communities . Furthermore, a ScienceDirect study found that small taxes on groceries significantly increase the risk of food insecurity for low-income families. It’s important to highlight that this study looks at *general* grocery tax, not a fat tax specifically .<br><br>Fourth, they assert that a fat tax oversimplifies dietary behavior. We never claimed a fat tax is a singular, complete solution. It's one tool in a broader strategy that includes education, and increased access to healthy choices . These are complementary measures, not mutually exclusive. The revenue generated from a fat tax can be used to enhance nutrition education programs and increase access to healthy food choices. We argue that education and access to healthy options are equally impacted by socioeconomic status and education, so fat tax isn't necessarily worse in this case .<br><br>Finally, they express concern about creating a culture of moral judgment around food. We are implementing a pragmatic measure to promote public health, not a moral judgment on individual choices . Many products, like tobacco and alcohol, are taxed without creating widespread moral panic. There is a moral judgment and shame associated with food and weight now, so the fat tax is no different . The costs to society resulting from obesity and other diet-related diseases are immense—in terms of health-care costs, sickness absence, welfare payments, and lost tax revenue . The aim is not to punish, but to encourage healthier choices and offset the societal costs of unhealthy diets.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get to it. We’ve heard some interesting points, but we need to set the record straight on why a fat tax is not the right approach for developed countries. It's a flawed solution that creates more problems than it solves.<br><br>First, let’s address their claims about low-income families. They argue that a fat tax is manageable because the revenue will subsidize healthy food. However, this argument fails to acknowledge the immediate and disproportionate burden such a tax places on those with the fewest resources. As *Healthy People 2030* points out, people without access to grocery stores with healthy foods are less likely to have good nutrition, raising their risk of health conditions. A fat tax exacerbates this problem by limiting access to affordable calories and nutrition. Instituting a fat tax could hurt those in lower-income households as many of them rely on the cheaper, less healthy foods that would be taxed under such a policy. Since these households typically spend a significant portion of their total income on food, they would not only be unable to afford the healthier foods but they would also be forced to pay more for the foods that they could afford. This isn't just about economics; it's about infringing on the rights of individuals to secure basic nutrition.<br><br>Second, let's examine their promise of revenue for healthy food. They assume governments will efficiently allocate fat tax revenue to subsidize healthy options. But history is filled with instances of good intentions gone awry. Imagine if the fat tax revenue was diverted to a poorly designed education program that few people attended. This could waste the taxpayers' money. Moreover, even with the best intentions, the administrative costs associated with implementing and managing such a system can be substantial. As *PMC* highlights, despite evidence on the effectiveness of economic incentives in modifying dietary behavior, policy adoptions remain scarce, in part due to concerns about the unintended consequences and opposition from the food industry. This *PMC* study highlights that fat tax will fail because of the unintended consequences. The focus on subsidies also overlooks the importance of education and cultural factors that influence dietary choices.<br><br>Third, they suggest a fat tax is just one tool in a broader strategy. But this is like saying a hammer is a great tool for building a house when you only have nails. Obesity is a multifaceted issue influenced by cultural norms, personal preferences, and socioeconomic factors. As *Eufic* explains, what people eat is formed and constrained by circumstances that are essentially social and cultural. A fat tax unfairly targets specific food items without addressing these underlying issues. The claim that fat taxes effectively encourage healthier choices commits a *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy: correlation does not equal causation. Just because healthier choices follow the implementation of a fat tax does not mean the tax caused the change.<br><br>Now, let's revisit individual rights. They claimed a healthier population empowers individual rights. While a healthy population is important, we cannot trample on individual liberties to get there. There needs to be a balance.<br><br>Finally, remember Denmark? Their fat tax failed. Consumers switched to cheaper, untaxed options. The administrative costs were too high. These are practical problems that outweigh any theoretical benefits.<br><br>In conclusion, while the intention to improve public health is admirable, a fat tax is not the answer. It unfairly burdens low-income individuals, relies on unrealistic promises about government efficiency, and ignores the complexities of dietary behavior. We need solutions that empower, not punish, and that address the root causes of unhealthy eating habits.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and a steam judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of a fat tax on public health. Particularly focusing on low-income populations and the role of government intervention. The core contention raised by the opposition is the potential for disproportionate harm to low-income individuals. However. Are proposal is designed with this concern at the for. The revenue generated from the fat tax will be strategically directed towards subsidies for healthy food options. Ensuring affordability and accessibility. For all income brackets. Drawing from the successful implementation in kerala india. Three we see a tangible shift in dietary habits when healthy choices are made financially viable. The opposition sites general grocery taxes as evidence of harm. But we are proposing a specifically designed tax and subsidy system. A secondary concern involves the efficiency of government implementation. While we acknowledge the potential for mismanagement. Transparency and accountability are paramount. We advocate for ring fenced funding mechanism. Guaranteeing that revenues are dedicated to public health initiatives. The revenue generated from a fat tax can be used to enhance nutrition education programs. An increase access to healthy food choices 5. The opposition also suggests that a fat tax oversimplifies complex dietary behaviors. We agree that obesity is multifaceted. But this tax serves as a crucial component within a broader strategy encompassing education and increased availability of nutritious options. It's about creating an environment where healthier choices are both appealing and attainable. Regarding individual rights we contend that the right to health is a fundamental aspect of societal well-being. The societal costs of obesity. Healthcare burdens reduced productivity and diminished quality of life cannot be ignored 5.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">This debate centers on whether we prioritize individual rights or embrace a purely utilitarian approach to public health. We firmly oppose the fat tax, viewing it as a misguided attempt that undermines core principles and creates more problems than it solves.<br><br>First, consider the disproportionate burden on low-income individuals. The promise of subsidies is insufficient to counteract the immediate impact of a fat tax, which limits access to affordable calories and essential nutrition for those who can least afford it. *Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies in 2014* demonstrated that such taxes often hit the poorest households hardest, reducing their already limited food budgets .<br><br>Second, obesity is far more complex than simply the price of food. A fat tax ignores the deeply ingrained cultural, socioeconomic, and personal factors that shape dietary choices. As *a 2018 report by the World Health Organization* points out, effective obesity strategies require comprehensive approaches that address education, access to healthy foods, and lifestyle changes .<br><br>Finally, let's not ignore the very real problems of government inefficiency. Remember Denmark? *A 2013 evaluation by the Danish Economic Council* revealed that their fat tax was a failure, punishing the poor and creating administrative nightmares .<br><br>In closing, a truly healthy society values individual rights. It empowers its citizens through education and access, not through punitive taxes that restrict choices and disproportionately burden those most in need. We must champion solutions that address the root causes of unhealthy eating, fostering a society where everyone has the opportunity to make informed and healthy choices. For these reasons, the motion must fail.</div>
