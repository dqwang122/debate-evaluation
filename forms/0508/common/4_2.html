                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that processed foods, through strategic application and innovation, are not antithetical to, but rather a crucial component of sustainable food systems.<br><br>Our judging criteria is based on utilitarianism, prioritizing the option that maximizes food security, minimizes environmental impact, and ensures affordability for both current and future generations. Therefore, we contend that the team that demonstrates the greatest overall benefit in these areas should win this debate.<br><br>First, processed foods significantly reduce food waste and extend shelf life, leading to increased resource efficiency. The Food and Agriculture Organization  estimates that roughly one-third of the food produced globally for human consumption is lost or wasted each year . This waste accounts for 8-10% of global greenhouse gas emissions . However, processing techniques like canning, freezing, and drying extend the shelf life of perishable goods, preventing spoilage. For example, canning tomatoes allows them to be stored for over a year without significant nutrient loss, compared to fresh tomatoes that spoil within a week . This reduction in waste translates directly to more efficient use of resources. A study in "Nature" found that processing ensures food safety and prolongs shelf life, directly correlating to less food waste . By minimizing waste at various stages of the supply chain, processed foods maximize the utility derived from land, water, and energy investments, contributing to a more sustainable system.<br><br>Second, processed foods enhance food security and affordability, especially for vulnerable populations. Access to nutritious food is not uniformly distributed, with many regions facing challenges in affordability and availability of fresh produce. Processing can make essential nutrients more accessible by enabling fortification and creating shelf-stable products. For example, fortifying processed grains with iron and folic acid has proven effective in combating micronutrient deficiencies in developing countries . Furthermore, processed foods often offer a more affordable alternative to fresh produce, particularly out of season or in remote areas. The Sustainable Nutrition Initiative highlights that processed foods can provide access to safe and nutritious food to many people . By offering cost-effective, nutrient-rich options, processed foods serve as a vital tool in ensuring food security for vulnerable populations, promoting equity within sustainable food systems.<br><br>Third, innovations in food processing technologies are fostering more environmentally sustainable practices. The food processing industry is not static; it is continually evolving with advancements aimed at minimizing its environmental footprint. Innovations like pulsed electric field processing, which reduces energy consumption compared to traditional thermal processing, and advanced packaging materials that extend shelf life while minimizing waste, are gaining traction . DC Norris, a leader in food processing equipment, is committed to developing and installing environmentally friendly technologies . These technologies reduce energy consumption, minimize water usage, and decrease waste generation, contributing to a more circular and sustainable food system. As research continues and these technologies become more widespread, the environmental impact of food processing will continue to diminish, reinforcing its role in sustainable food systems.<br><br>In conclusion, by reducing food waste, enhancing food security, and embracing technological innovation, processed foods are essential for building sustainable food systems that can nourish current and future generations. We urge you to consider the evidence and affirm the motion that processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We appreciate the opposition's focus on food security, environmental impact, and affordability. However, we believe their utilitarian approach, while well-intentioned, presents an incomplete picture of a sustainable food system. While maximizing overall benefit is important, a truly sustainable food system must also consider the health impacts and social equity of its choices. Therefore, we contend that focusing solely on those three factors overlooks critical aspects: the long-term health consequences and the fair distribution of benefits. In this debate, social justice in food systems means fair and equal access to nutritious, culturally appropriate, and sustainably produced food for all communities, regardless of income, race, or geographic location. Our criteria, therefore, includes not only food security, minimal environmental impact, and affordability, but also health equity and social justice.<br><br>First, let's address food security. While the opposition argues that processed foods enhance food security and affordability, particularly for vulnerable populations, this argument overlooks the significant nutritional deficiencies and health risks associated with increased consumption of processed foods. *Dr. Martin Weber, Team Lead for Quality of Care at WHO/Europe*, stated in 2024 that affordability and accessibility of healthy food options are often limited for families with lower incomes, leading to a higher reliance on processed and sugary foods, which can have detrimental effects on health . Processed foods are often cheaper and more readily available in low-income areas. This contributes to higher rates of obesity, diabetes, and other diet-related diseases, reinforcing existing health disparities. While processed foods might seem like a solution to food insecurity, they often fail to address underlying issues such as poverty, lack of education, and unequal access to land and resources.<br><br>Second, let's discuss the environment. The opposition claims innovations in food processing technologies foster more environmentally sustainable practices. However, expanding processed food production intensifies environmental pollution through increased packaging waste, transportation emissions, and resource-intensive manufacturing processes. According to *the journal Environmental Science and Pollution Research in 2024*, food processing, production, and consumption hold more than 20% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions . While the opposition might argue that transportation emissions are similar when considering waste, this ignores the significant environmental impact of the processing itself.<br><br>Finally, the opposition says that processed foods reduce waste. However, government subsidies that favor commodity crops used in processed foods distort the market and disadvantage producers of fresh, whole foods. *Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute*, found in a 2023 study that federal farm programs blunt market mechanisms, which can cause overproduction, inadequate cost control, and distorted decisions about land use and choice of crops . Instead of relying on processed foods, we need to invest in local agriculture, promote nutrition education, and advocate for policies that support access to healthy food for all.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four flaws, which are their judging criteria, food security argument, environmental impact argument, and government subsidies argument.<br><br>First, the opposition attempts to expand the judging criteria to include "health equity" and "social justice." While we agree that these are important considerations, we believe our original criteria—food security, environmental impact, and affordability—inherently address these concerns. Food security directly impacts vulnerable populations, meaning that by increasing food security, we are also addressing the social justice issue of equitable access to nutrition . Similarly, the negative effects of environmental degradation disproportionately affect these same communities. By minimizing environmental impact, we are promoting social justice. Furthermore, the opposition's added criteria are vaguely defined, making it difficult to assess any tangible progress.<br><br>Second, regarding food security, the opposition argues that processed foods lead to nutritional deficiencies and health risks, particularly for low-income populations. However, this paints an incomplete picture. It is not inherent to *all* processed foods to be unhealthy. In fact, many processed foods are fortified with essential nutrients, addressing deficiencies and improving public health . For instance, fortifying grains with folic acid has significantly reduced neural tube defects. Moreover, fresh foods are not without their own risks. Improper handling or storage can lead to bacterial contamination, negating their nutritional benefits. Ultimately, we must live in reality: processed foods are already an inextricable part of our lives. Complete removal of processed foods would be a mistake, since it would be ignoring many of the benefits they bring.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that expanding processed food production intensifies environmental pollution. We disagree, because while we acknowledge that there are environmental costs to the production of processed foods, environmentally conscious innovations and reducing food waste greatly helps to minimize these costs. Transportation emissions are similar for both fresh and processed foods . A 2023 study by *Environmental Science and Technology* found that processed foods can have lower transportation emissions than fresh produce due to efficient supply chains and reduced spoilage. Furthermore, innovations in food processing are leading to more sustainable practices. Pulsed electric field processing reduces energy consumption, and advancements in packaging minimize waste . Most importantly, we must remember that processed foods greatly reduce food waste, leading to an overall lower environmental impact .<br><br>Fourth, the opposition raises the issue of government subsidies that favor commodity crops used in processed foods. While we acknowledge that subsidies can distort the market, this is a separate policy issue, and is a red herring that should be addressed on its own merits. Subsidies are not inherent to processed foods. Policy can be changed; subsidies can be reformed or eliminated regardless of the role we want processed foods to play . Furthermore, subsidies exist for all kinds of agricultural products, not just those used in processed foods. Therefore, the issue of the role of processed foods should be judged separately from the separate issue of government subsidies.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get straight to it. We strongly disagree with several points the opposition has made. We will directly address these concerns, reinforcing our claim that a truly sustainable food system must prioritize health equity and social justice for all, not just a privileged few.<br><br>First, let's address our judging criteria. The opposition claims their utilitarian approach inherently covers health equity and social justice. We fundamentally disagree. Food security and environmental protection are undeniably important, but they absolutely do not guarantee that everyone has access to nutritious food or a healthy environment. Health equity and social justice demand actively addressing existing inequalities, not passively assuming they'll be magically solved by maximizing overall benefit. It’s like saying a rising tide lifts all boats, but some boats have holes in them and will sink regardless of how high the tide gets. Utilitarianism conveniently overlooks those with holes. Therefore, relying solely on utilitarianism is not enough; we must include health equity and social justice as essential components of our judging criteria.<br><br>Second, they argue that processed foods are healthy because they're fortified. Sure, some processed foods are fortified. However, fortification is not a magic bullet. It simply cannot compensate for the other unhealthy ingredients and the inherent lack of essential nutrients found in whole, unprocessed foods. As Aimee Aristotelous, a nutritionist and bestselling author, stated in *a 2025 article by Northwell Health*, the health implications of processed foods are dire, as most consist of empty calories that offer little nutrition. Plus, focusing solely on fortification distracts from the broader and more critical goal: ensuring access to truly nutritious food for everyone, regardless of income or location. It does not mean they are actually healthy for people.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims that innovations in food processing technologies are fostering more environmentally sustainable practices. But this argument is a bit of a stretch, and here’s why. While those innovations might offer marginal improvements, the fundamental problem remains: the production of highly processed ingredients is inherently energy-intensive, causes significant pollution, and requires vast amounts of resources. These supposedly environmentally conscious innovations are far from a comprehensive solution. The opposition highlights the reduction of food waste, but this doesn’t negate the fact that these processes consume substantial energy and water, and generate considerable waste during the manufacturing stage. Food is the single largest component taking up space inside US landfills, making up 22 percent of municipal solid waste.<br><br>Finally, the opposition attempts to dismiss government subsidies as a separate issue. This is simply unacceptable. The government's support for commodity crops, which are heavily used in processed foods, creates a system that is fundamentally unfair and unsustainable. As we've discussed, this artificially inflates the price of fresh, healthy food, making it less accessible and affordable, particularly for low-income communities. This is not a separate issue; it's absolutely central to this debate. As *a report* shows, corporate lobbying in the agricultural sector has nearly doubled in the past few decades, from USD 79 million in 2000 to just over USD 150 million in 2021. This directly contradicts the claim that processed foods enhance food security and affordability.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around whether processed foods should play a larger role in sustainable food systems.<br><br>The first battleground was the judging criteria. The opposition argued for including "health equity" and "social justice" as separate criteria, claiming our utilitarian approach doesn't guarantee equitable outcomes. We maintain that maximizing food security, minimizing environmental impact, and ensuring affordability inherently address social justice. For example, improved food security directly aids vulnerable populations . By reducing environmental degradation, we alleviate disproportionate impacts on marginalized communities. Their criteria are vague, making tangible progress difficult to assess. We acknowledge the importance of these values, but our framework provides a more practical and measurable path to achieving a truly sustainable food system.<br><br>The second battleground concerned the health impact of processed foods. While some processed foods are undeniably unhealthy, it's not inherent to all. Responsible innovation can create healthier, more nutritious options. Fortification is a powerful tool, addressing deficiencies and improving public health . We should aim to reformulate processed foods, as it increases the value and sustainability of the entire agricultural system.<br><br>The third battleground was environmental impact. The opposition claimed innovations in food processing are marginal. However, these advancements are making a significant difference. For instance, pulsed electric field processing reduces energy consumption, and advancements in packaging minimize waste . Processed foods like canned tomatoes and frozen fruits often have lower carbon footprints due to efficient supply chains . While all food production has an impact,<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, this debate centers on a critical question: what constitutes true sustainability? Is it merely about maximizing output, as the opposition's utilitarian approach suggests? Or does it require a more holistic vision, one that integrates health equity and social justice alongside efficiency? We maintain that a truly sustainable food system must prioritize the well-being of all, especially the most vulnerable.<br><br>First, let's revisit the claim that processed foods are healthy because they're fortified. As we've demonstrated, fortification is a superficial solution. Processed foods inherently lack essential nutrients and disproportionately harm low-income communities. Can we truly call a system sustainable when it leaves so many behind, suffering from diet-related diseases? This is not a sustainable system.<br><br>Second, the opposition touts environmental innovations in processed food production. However, these innovations don't negate the significant environmental costs. The processed food industry is incredibly energy-intensive and polluting. Manufacturing these foods consumes substantial energy and water, and generates considerable waste.<br><br>Finally, let's consider the issue of government subsidies. These subsidies, fueled by corporate lobbying, create a system rigged against fairness. They distort the market, making healthy, affordable food less accessible to those who need it most. This isn't just a minor issue; it's a core injustice that undermines the very notion of a sustainable and equitable food system.<br><br>Therefore, we advocate for a food system that nourishes both people and the planet, where everyone, regardless of income or background, has fair access to good, healthy food. We urge you to reject a narrow vision of sustainability that sacrifices health and equity for the sake of mere efficiency and corporate profit.</div>
