                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. We are here today to discuss why mandatory wage transparency laws are essential to address the persistent gender wage gap. By “mandatory wage transparency laws,” we mean that employers across all sectors and company sizes are required to disclose salary ranges or pay data to their employees and/or the public. This focuses on ensuring equal pay for equal work, regardless of gender, and enabling fairer negotiations and the identification of systemic biases in the labor market.<br><br>Our judging criterion today is simple: which side presents the most compelling case for reducing the gender wage gap and promoting fairness in the workplace?<br><br>First, wage transparency is a powerful tool for closing the gender wage gap by revealing unfair pay differences. When salaries are open, women can readily see if they are being paid less than their male counterparts for the same work. This visibility empowers them to negotiate for fair pay or file complaints, directly reducing pay inequality. *Forbes* magazine, a leading American business publication, reports that wage gaps and pay inequity have been found to be reduced in organizations that utilize salary transparency . In fact, the gender pay gap could be reduced by up to 40% with broad pay transparency. Consider the story of a woman who discovered she was being paid significantly less than her male colleague, despite having the same qualifications and experience. Armed with this knowledge, she successfully negotiated a salary increase, highlighting the real-world impact of transparency. This isn't just about individual cases; it's about systemic change. Moreover, closing the gender wage gap through transparency not only ensures fairness but also boosts economic growth by unleashing the full potential of our workforce.<br><br>Second, wage transparency reduces the need for individual salary negotiations, which are often influenced by bias. With transparent pay structures, salaries are based on objective criteria rather than negotiation skills, which can reduce the impact of gender bias in pay decisions, leading to fairer outcomes for women. When the pay is already made visible, it reduces the impact of any biases during negotiation. Research indicates that pay negotiations are notoriously unfavorable to women. According to a *October 2023* fact sheet from the Society for Human Resource Management, when an employer doesn’t provide job applicants or employees information about the pay for job positions, women lose out . The outdated practice of keeping pay secret allows discrimination and unjustified pay gaps to flourish and keeps employees from trusting they are paid fairly.<br><br>Third, wage transparency benefits younger generations entering the workforce. New graduates and younger workers gain valuable information about fair pay, empowering them to negotiate better starting salaries and avoid early-career pay gaps. This ensures they start their careers on a more equitable footing and are less likely to perpetuate existing pay disparities. It helps them better understand the market value of their skills. The salary transparency movement isn’t just a trend; it’s a revolution in how we approach compensation. From entry-level employees to seasoned executives, understanding and leveraging pay transparency empowers you to make informed career decisions.<br><br>While some may worry about the administrative burden of wage transparency, many modern payroll systems can easily generate the required reports, and the long-term benefits of a more equitable workforce far outweigh the initial costs.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that mandatory wage transparency laws are not the optimal solution for addressing the gender wage gap. We define **Mandatory Wage Transparency Laws** as laws requiring employers to disclose salary information to employees, potential hires, or the public, and the **Gender Wage Gap** as the difference between median earnings of men and women relative to median earnings of men.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **maximizing overall economic well-being and individual privacy**. The most desirable policy is the one that leads to the greatest overall improvement in societal welfare, while also respecting individual privacy rights. Mandatory wage transparency, while intending to address inequality, may have negative economic consequences and infringe upon privacy, thus hindering overall well-being.<br><br>First, **mandatory wage transparency can decrease overall productivity and morale**. While some argue that transparency boosts morale by fostering trust and fairness, this is not always the case. Transparency can lead to employee resentment if perceived as unfair or if discrepancies are large . Employees may feel distrust if they believe management is hiding pay disparities. Even justifiable reasons for pay differences, such as experience or performance, may not be readily apparent or accepted by all employees, leading to dissatisfaction. As John List notes, when employees know how much other workers at the same level were being paid, they became resentful and demotivated if any of their peers were earning more than them . This can reduce morale and, consequently, productivity, harming the overall economic output of the company and the economy.<br><br>Second, **mandatory wage transparency infringes upon individual privacy rights**. Salary information is personal financial data, and mandatory disclosure can expose employees to unwanted scrutiny and potential discrimination . Employees have a right to keep their compensation private. Balancing wage transparency with individual privacy is essential for fair practices . Forcing employees to disclose their salaries can lead to discomfort and stigma among employees.<br><br>Third, **alternatives to mandatory wage transparency are more effective and less intrusive**. Solutions such as pay equity audits, blind hiring practices, and promoting flexible work arrangements can address the gender wage gap without the negative consequences of mandatory transparency. Pay equity audits are effective in identifying wage gaps and promoting fair compensation, especially when followed by thorough action . Blind hiring reduces bias and improves diversity in hiring outcomes . Flexible work arrangements can help reduce the gender pay gap by enabling more women to return to work and advance their careers . Furthermore, employer-provided onsite childcare increases the retention of female managers during parental leave by 18.9% . These approaches are less likely to cause resentment, productivity declines, or privacy violations.<br><br>In conclusion, mandatory wage transparency laws, while well-intentioned, are not the optimal solution for addressing the gender wage gap. They can decrease productivity and morale, infringe upon individual privacy rights, and are less effective than alternative solutions like pay equity audits, blind hiring, and flexible work arrangements. We advocate for policies that maximize economic well-being and respect individual privacy.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Good morning, everyone. Our opponents have voiced concerns, but let's be clear: wage transparency is vital for a fair and equitable workplace. We firmly believe that mandatory wage transparency laws should be implemented to address the persistent gender wage gap.<br><br>First, let's reinforce why wage transparency is so crucial. The gender wage gap persists, and transparency is a powerful tool for revealing and rectifying unfair pay differences. As *Forbes* reported, numerous studies have found that greater pay transparency reduces the gender pay gap because when pay data is hidden, companies can avoid pressure from employees, consumers, and investors to equalize pay . Women deserve to know if they are being paid fairly. Transparent pay structures reduce bias and promote equity. According to *HRMorning*, employers should standardize salary ranges to ensure they are consistent internally and reflect the market value for specific positions . Younger generations benefit from understanding the market value of their skills. The long-term benefits of equity far outweigh any perceived costs.<br><br>Second, let’s address their concerns about decreased productivity and morale. They suggest transparency will cause resentment and distrust. But isn't it better to address unfairness head-on rather than allow it to fester in the dark? Internal conflicts are best resolved with transparency, not secrecy. According to *Korn Ferry*, pay transparency can boost employee engagement and performance, creating a culture of trust and accountability . Would we rather have resentment based on misinformation, or fair wages and happier employees?<br><br>Third, they claim that mandatory wage transparency infringes upon individual privacy rights. But whose privacy are we really protecting here? The company that benefits from hiding pay disparities, or the employees who are being unfairly compensated? Their argument ignores the existing power imbalance that already compromises employee privacy. Is the discomfort of a few executives truly more important than the financial well-being of countless women?<br><br>Fourth, let's examine their so-called "alternatives." Pay equity audits and flexible work arrangements are helpful, but they don't guarantee transparency. And transparency is the key. Wage transparency laws do guarantee transparency, unlike the ‘less intrusive’ solutions they mentioned. According to *SHRM*, research shows that pay transparency can help close pay gaps, and job posts with salary information garner more applications and a higher quality of applicants . Are these alternatives truly addressing the systemic issues, or are they just a convenient way to avoid real change? The benefit of closing the gender wage gap outweighs the potential cost of implementing wage transparency.<br><br>Finally, we need to challenge the very foundation of their argument. They define "maximizing economic well-being and individual privacy" as the judging criterion. But is it truly maximizing well-being to allow systemic wage discrimination to continue? Isn't transparency a prerequisite for achieving genuine equality? It is time to prioritize transparency. As *a 2018 study by the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives*, pay transparency requirements can close the pay gap by 20–40%.<br><br>We stand firm on our side. Vote for fairness, vote for transparency, vote for progress. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person. Steam judges ladies and gentlemen. The opponent's rebuttal contains several flaws specifically in their interpretation of evidence. Dismissal of privacy concerns and the effectiveness of alternative solutions. First the affirmative claims forbes an hr morning unequivocally support wage transparency showing that transparency can help close pay gaps they highlight studies suggesting positive outcomes. However they fail to acknowledge the potential for negative consequences. Studies show that wage transparency can lead to pay disparities. Reduce employee morale and complicate negotiations. As list points out wage transparency can have a variety of positive and negative effects depending on how it's implemented to. By presenting only one side of the story they commit a hasty generalization. Therefore their claim that wage transparency is a guaranteed solution is unfounded. And are concerns about its potential downsides remain valid. Second. They argue that our concerns about decreased productivity and morale are unfounded. Suggesting it's better to address unfairness head-on. They dismiss the potential for resentment and distrust. However research indicates that when employees know how much other workers at the same level were being paid they became resentful and demotivated if any of their peers were earning more than them. This isn't about hiding on fairness it's about acknowledging the complexities of human psychology. And the potential for unintended negative consequences when implementing mandatory wage transparency. We are not saying that all transparency is bad. But a mandatory policy can do more harm than good. Therefore they're dismissal of our concerns is overly simplistic. And ignores the real world impact on employee morale and productivity. Third the affirmative downplays are privacy concerns. Framing them as protecting companies hiding pay disparities rather than individual employee rights they question whose privacy we are truly protecting. This is a straw man argument. Our concern is not about protecting companies. What about protecting the privacy of individual employees? Salary information is personal financial data. And mandatory disclosure can expose employees to unwanted scrutiny and potential discrimination. Individual privacy is a fundamental right regardless of power imbalances. Alternatives such as pay equity audits can address power imbalances without sacrificing this right. Therefore their attempt to dismiss our privacy concerns is misleading and ignores the importance of individual autonomy and data protection. Fourth they criticize our proposed alternatives such as pay equity audits and blind hiring practices. Claiming they don't guarantee transparency. They claim wage transparency laws do guarantee transparency. Unlike the less intrusive solutions. Play equity audits offer a more structured and targeted approach to addressing inequities. These audits provide more structured data while wage transparency may lead to quicker but potentially less accurate adjustments. Additionally blind hiring effectively reduces bias and improves diversity in hiring outcomes 6. Therefore. Are proposed alternatives offer a more comprehensive and less intrusive solution to addressing the gender wage gap. Finally the affirmative challenges are judging criterion arguing that allowing systemic wage discrimination undermines economic well-being they suggest transparency is a prerequisite for achieving genuine inequality. We can tell that economic well-being is a prerequisite for equality. You cannot have equality if everyone is worse off. Cultural resistance to transparency remains a significant obstacle. Mandatory wage transparency could harm the economy leading to decreased productivity and morale ultimately making everyone including women worse off.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we've focused on achieving workplace fairness. While our opponents prioritize economic well-being and individual privacy, we argue that mandatory wage transparency is the superior solution.<br><br>Firstly, transparency *enhances* economic well-being. Reduced wage disparities foster trust and fairness, boosting productivity. Concerns about morale are minor compared to the harm of hidden inequity. As *the National Bureau of Economic Research reported in 2016*, companies with transparent pay policies see higher employee satisfaction and lower turnover . This shows that wage openness creates a more positive, productive environment.<br><br>Secondly, while privacy is important, it's secondary to equity. The current system already compromises privacy through informal discussions and employer data collection. Increased scrutiny is a worthwhile trade-off for correcting systemic injustice. *The Pew Research Center reported in 2020* that most Americans believe addressing gender inequality is critical, even with adjustments to privacy norms .<br><br>Finally, this debate hinges on actionable results. Audits are helpful, but don't guarantee the transparency needed for real change. Our opponents fail to address achieving lasting fair work. The fact that transparency alone doesn't guarantee change is beside the point; it is a necessary condition. *The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2018* that states with stronger wage transparency laws have seen a measurable reduction in the gender wage gap .<br><br>Vote for fairness. Choose transparency. Support a more equitable workplace. Prioritize gender equality, justice, and a future where everyone is valued and fairly compensated.</div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the effectiveness and consequences of mandatory wage transparency laws in addressing the gender wage gap.<br><br>Our opponents claim wage transparency boosts morale and productivity, but studies show it can lead to pay disparities and reduce employee morale . As List points out, resentment and demotivation arise when employees discover pay differences, even if justifiable . It's not about hiding unfairness; it's about acknowledging human psychology and the potential for unintended negative consequences.<br><br>The affirmative downplays privacy concerns, but salary information is personal financial data. Mandatory disclosure exposes employees to unwanted scrutiny and potential discrimination . Our concern isn't protecting companies; it's about safeguarding individual privacy, a fundamental right that alternatives like pay equity audits respect.<br><br>While the opposition claims our alternatives don't guarantee transparency, pay equity audits offer a structured, targeted approach, providing more accurate data . Blind hiring reduces bias and flexible work arrangements support women's career advancement . These alternatives offer a comprehensive solution without the negative consequences of mandatory transparency.<br><br>Our opponents challenge our judging criterion, but economic well-being and individual privacy are both essential. You cannot have equality if everyone is worse off. Mandatory wage transparency could harm the economy, decreasing productivity and morale , ultimately making everyone, including women, worse off.<br><br>Finally, forcing individuals to disclose their salaries infringes upon their personal freedom and dignity. Cultural resistance to transparency remains a significant obstacle . We urge you to consider the value of individual privacy and economic well-being,<br><br></div>
