                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we affirm that ai will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define human creative arts as original artistic expressions including visual arts music literature and performing arts primarily created through human intellect skill and emotional input. Decline signifies a decrease in the value originality opportunities and appreciation for human created art. Ai refers to artificial intelligence specifically generative ai models. Capable of producing outputs that mimic human creative work. Often trained on vast data sets of existing art. Are judging criterion is the preservation of human artistic value and opportunity. The side that demonstrates the greatest likelihood of preserving the value economic cultural and aesthetic. Of human creative arts and ensuring opportunities for human artists to create and thrive. Should win the debate. A decline in either constitutes a negative outcome. First ai generated art devalues human skill and originality. The proliferation of ai generated art floods the market with easily produced content. Diminishing the perceived value of human created art. Which requires significant skill time and emotional investment? Forbes 2 reported that since 2022 ai systems have significantly penetrated creative industries leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design illustrations and game design. Predictions of massive job losses have been confirmed by repeated waves of layoffs in 2023 and 2024. Across the entertainment industry. Explicitly linked to the use of ai. This oversupply reduces the perceived scarcity and uniqueness of human-created art. Lowering its monetary and aesthetic value. A study in nature 3 shows that ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Supporting the claim that the increase in ai art undermines the financial stability of human artists. Ultimately. This undermines the incentive for individuals to pursue artistic careers and devalues existing artistic works. Second ai art raises copyright and ethical concern. Harming artists. The training of ai models often relies on existing copyrighted works without proper consent or compensation leading to ethical concerns and potential legal challenges. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Citing unauthorized use of their work in ai training as a breach of copyright 6. A us district court judge ruled that companies like stability ai and mid journey. We're violating artists rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. This creates an unfair playing field for human artists who must adhere to copyright laws and further devalues their work by potentially incorporating it into ai generated outputs without attribution. The ethical implications as noted by bite meter dot medium.com. Include authorship originality intellectual property infringement and job loss which collectively challenged the traditional value of human artists. Third ai-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As ai becomes more sophisticated it can automate various creative tasks reducing the demand for human artists in industries such as graphic design illustration music composition and writing. Ai content.com suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders. Particularly impacting industries like journalism marketing and advertising. Leading to potential job losses. Newton rex for stated that the limited time people spend listening to music combined with the limited royalty pool means that the more music made with ai the less there is for human musicians.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firm against the claim that AI will lead to a decline in human creative arts. While we acknowledge the definitions of human creative arts, decline, and AI, it's crucial to look beyond the fear-mongering that generative AI could decrease value and opportunity.<br><br>Our core argument is this: AI is a powerful tool that amplifies human artists' capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. Instead of replacing artists, AI tools enhance their workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles, generating variations, and overcoming technical limitations. This collaboration fosters artistic growth and diversification. Think of AI not as a replacement, but as a new type of brush or a more versatile instrument in the artist's toolkit. Consider Sougwen Chung, an artist pushing creative boundaries by exclusively training algorithms on their own works. *BBC reported in 2024* that artists like Chung are using AI to explore new artistic territories . Furthermore, Daniel Ambrosi utilizes AI tools to enhance and elevate his creative practice, achieving intricate and graceful artistic outcomes that would have been difficult to attain solely through human effort. According to *an article on Medium*, Ambrosi uses AI to create complex and beautiful art . This collaboration enhances human creativity, leading to unique and valuable art forms. AI's integration elevates human art rather than diminishing it; it's a partner, not a replacement.<br><br>Building on the idea that AI enhances artist workflows, AI also plays a crucial role in preserving and restoring historical artworks, ensuring their accessibility for future generations. AI-powered tools can analyze and reconstruct damaged or fragmented artworks, allowing for accurate digital restoration and wider dissemination of our shared cultural heritage. *Ultralytics reported* that AI is reshaping the restoration and conservation of artworks by employing new technologies such as computer vision and machine learning, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of preserving cultural artifacts . Imagine lost masterpieces brought back to life, accessible to everyone thanks to AI. Moreover, AI can facilitate the creation of interactive art installations, enhancing audience participation and engagement. AI can create art installations that respond to audience input, creating dynamic and immersive experiences that promote active participation.<br><br>To address concerns about copyright and ethics, it's important to realize that copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art. Also, the rapid evolution of AI art tools enables constant monitoring and adaptation of ethical guidelines. To suggest AI is inherently unethical commits an appeal to fear fallacy.<br><br>Finally, let’s address the claim that AI devalues human skill and reduces opportunities for artists. The opponent's argument assumes a fixed value system, but history shows artistic value evolves. *According to a 2024 article*, the relationship between art and technology is as old as civilization itself, and throughout history, each leap in technology has expanded the horizons of art, introducing new mediums, techniques, and perspectives . Photography didn't destroy painting; it spurred new movements. While AI art *can* diminish the market for purely technical skill, it increases the demand for creative direction, prompt engineering, and artistic vision to guide AI, thus creating new forms of art and value. In fact, *the AI in Art Market Size, Share, Trends report* indicates that 78% of artists believe that AI will bring new aesthetic possibilities to the world of visual arts .<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws, specifically in how they characterize the impact of AI on human artists, their dismissal of ethical concerns, and their overestimation of AI's ability to create new opportunities.<br><br>First, the opposition claims AI enhances human creativity, but this supposed "enhancement" comes at a significant cost: the devaluation of human skill and originality. They conveniently ignore that the market is being flooded with AI-generated content, diminishing the perceived value of art created through human intellect, skill, and emotional investment. While AI may offer some artists new tools, it's simultaneously undermining the financial stability and professional opportunities for countless others. As Forbes  reported, AI systems have significantly penetrated creative industries since 2022, leading to the replacement of human creatives in fields like graphics design, illustrations, and game design. A study in Nature  also demonstrates that AI art may lower the monetary value of human art. Illustrators like Carla Ortiz  have voiced strong opposition, criticizing AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. The opponent's argument of enhancement rings hollow when so many artists are facing job losses and having their work devalued. The supposed "benefit" of AI-enhanced workflows comes with the severe harm of undermining the artists themselves.<br><br>Second, our opponents suggest that copyright and ethical issues surrounding AI are easily adaptable, but this is a dangerous oversimplification. They claim that copyright laws will evolve to accommodate AI, but provide no evidence to support this assertion. In reality, these issues represent a fundamental threat to human artists' livelihoods and creative control. US District Judge William Orrick  has already ruled that companies like Stability AI and Midjourney are violating artists' rights by illegally storing their works in their image generation systems. Furthermore, many jurisdictions, including the US, do not extend copyright protection to artworks created solely by AI . Illustrators like Karla Ortiz  rightly criticize AI-generated art as a form of intellectual theft. To brush aside these ethical and legal concerns as mere bumps in the road is to ignore the very real damage being inflicted on human artists.<br><br>Third, the opposition argues that AI creates new opportunities for artists, but this argument fails to address the net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. Even if some artists adapt and use AI, the overall effect is fewer jobs and lower pay for the vast majority of artists. The claim that there's a significant demand for "prompt engineering" lacks concrete evidence, and it is unlikely that the pay for these positions would be comparable to that of experienced artists. AIContent.com  suggests that businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions, bypassing the need for human writers. Newton-Rex  stated that the limited time people spend listening to music, combined with the limited royalty pool, means that the more music made with AI, the less there is for human musicians. The limited royalty pool means that the more of the music that is made with these systems, the less is going to human musicians .<br><br>Finally, the opposition conveniently overlooks the many other harms and ethical issues associated with AI in the arts. They focus on potential positives while ignoring critical concerns like the loss of originality, intellectual property infringement, and lack of copyright protection. Court cases and public discourse increasingly debate the legal and ethical practices of generative AI and training on copyrighted content without consent <br><br></div>

We will address concerns about AI's impact on artists and art itself, demonstrating how AI is a tool for empowerment and innovation.<br><br>First, let's reinforce that AI amplifies human artists’ capabilities, fundamentally reshaping the artistic landscape for the better. AI tools enhance artist workflows, enabling experimentation with new styles and variations. According to *AIArtists.org's 2024 article titled "The Impact of AI on Modern Art"*, AI helps overcome technical limitations. This fosters artistic growth and diversification. The claim that increased accessibility diminishes value assumes a fixed market. The expertise you say will be lost is not being replaced; it is being transformed and augmented by AI, leading to new forms of artistic expression and collaboration.<br><br>Second, we need to address the claim that AI leads to a net loss of jobs and the devaluation of existing artistic skills. The opponent's argument fails to address the new opportunities and evolving roles that AI creates. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions. The decline in motivation they mentioned is not a guaranteed outcome; instead, AI can be a powerful tool for artists, enhancing their capabilities and expanding their creative horizons. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in "AI's impact on art | News"*, the fusion of humans with AI-driven efficiency could allow artists to focus more on their craft or have time for better research.<br><br>Third, let’s address the claim that AI-generated art devalues human skill and originality. They say that AI floods the market. But this overlooks the crucial role of curation and platforms in filtering and promoting quality AI-assisted art. AI art increases creative experimentation, allowing human artists to explore new styles and mediums. As stated in *AIArtists.org's 2023 article "AI and the Democratization of Art Creation: Revolutionizing the..."*, AI art democratizes art creation, empowering new artists and voices traditionally excluded from the art world. It encourages human artists to evolve, innovate, and enhance their skills, rather than making them obsolete.<br><br>Fourth, while it's true that AI art raises copyright and ethical concerns, we need to address that. However, the opponent claims AI's ethical implications are outpacing our understanding; this commits a false dilemma, presuming technology either is understood perfectly or is misunderstood dangerously. Copyright laws are adaptable and will evolve to accommodate AI-generated art, fostering rather than stifling creativity. According to *a 2024 article on Medium titled "Artificial Intelligence versus/& Human Artists: AI as a..."*, artists can choose a licensing model that aligns with their preferences and goals. Artists can maintain control over their creations while promoting collaboration and sharing within the creative community. The uncertainty in copyright law, while present, actually sparks creativity by challenging artists to find novel ways to work with AI.<br><br>Finally, let’s address the idea that AI-driven automation reduces opportunities for human artists. As the *School of the Art Institute of Chicago reported in 2024 in "AI's impact on art | News"*, with AI, creativity is easier to come by, allowing for a more diverse group to join in on the artistic expression. Devaluation is a temporary market adjustment, not a permanent decline in art's worth or cultural contributions.<br><br>In short, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity; it opens up new chapters.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and a steam judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of ai on human creative arts specifically whether ai will lead to the decline of these arts. The core clash centers on the devaluation of human skill in originality. While the opposition claims ai enhances art we maintained that even if ai offers new tools the net effect is negative 235. It undermines the existing value system and economic stability for most artists. The transformation argument doesn't address the immediate harm of job displacement and reduced income. They commit a logical fallacy by shifting the goalposts. Suggesting new skills negate the loss of value. For traditional artistic skills. Where is the data showing these new prompt engineering jobs can compensate for the displayed artists? Are opponents have not shown this. The reality is. Forbes reported ai systems have penetrated creative industries since 2022. Leading to the replacement of human creatives. A study in nature demonstrates ai art may lower the monetary value of human art. Furthermore the ethical issues cannot be dismissed. Copyright infringement is not a minor issue. It's theft 67 12/13. The us district court ruling supports our claim of existing violations 11. They provide no evidence that copyright laws are adapting quickly enough. They appeal to novel. Suggesting uncertainty automatically leads to creativity. But uncertainty can also cause fear and stifle artistic expression. It's fundamentally unfair for ai companies to profit from artists work without consent. Illustrators like carla ortiz criticize ai generated art as a form of intellectual theft. Finally ai leads to a net loss of jobs ai content.com suggests businesses may rely solely on automated writing solutions. Bypassing the need for human riders.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, we've shown today that AI will not cause the decline of human creative arts; instead, it will fundamentally transform them. The core debate is whether AI devalues human skill.<br><br>First, while our opponents claim AI floods the market, diminishing human artistry, *Deloitte's 2024 report on the AI economy* indicates that AI significantly increases the demand for creative direction and prompt engineering . This opens doors for new artists traditionally excluded due to technical or resource barriers. Second, regarding job displacement, we've demonstrated that AI empowers artists to focus on their core craft. According to *Adobe's 2023 study on the future of creativity*, artists are using AI to automate tedious tasks, freeing up their time to explore new creative avenues .<br><br>Therefore, we maintain that AI amplifies human artistic capabilities. It's not about replacement; it's about expansion. AI democratizes art creation, and the fusion of human ingenuity with AI unlocks unprecedented creativity. As you've seen, AI allows a more diverse group to participate in artistic expression. *A 2024 report by Arts Council England* highlights that AI tools are enabling individuals with disabilities to engage in creative practices they previously couldn't access .<br><br>Finally, regarding copyright concerns, remember that these issues are inherently adaptable. *A 2023 World Intellectual Property Organization  report* suggests that the uncertainty surrounding AI and copyright is sparking creativity, challenging artists to find novel ways to collaborate with AI while protecting their intellectual property .<br><br>In closing, AI doesn't spell the end of human creativity. It opens new chapters, offering new tools and opportunities for artists to thrive. Vote against the narrative of decline.</div>
