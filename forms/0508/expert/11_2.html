                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that banning certain inappropriate books  in schools is necessary to protect child welfare and promote a safe learning environment. We define "inappropriate books" as those containing explicit depictions or endorsements of sex, violence, or drug use that are deemed unsuitable for children and adolescents due to their potential to cause harm or negatively influence their development. "School" refers to educational institutions catering to children and adolescents, from elementary to high school levels. Our judging criteria is protecting child welfare. The side that best demonstrates how their position promotes the well-being and healthy development of children in schools should win the debate.<br><br>First, exposure to explicit sexual content can lead to negative attitudes and behaviors. Studies show a correlation between exposure to sexually explicit material and increased sexual aggression and risky sexual behavior in minors . Specifically, research indicates that early exposure to sexually graphic material is likely to have a negative influence and a potentially harmful impact on children . Jenni White, a former public school science teacher, stated that “Numerous studies on the use of graphic material by students indicate negative psychological effects,” including having “more casual sex partners and  having sex at younger ages” . By banning books containing such content, we directly protect students from these potential harms, promoting their well-being and contributing to a healthier developmental trajectory. Therefore, limiting access to sexually explicit material is a proactive step toward safeguarding our children's future.<br><br>Second, exposure to violence in literature can contribute to desensitization and increased aggression in adolescents. Adolescents are exposed to about 30.23 acts of aggression for every hour of reading popular novels . Studies by the American Academy of Pediatrics have found that exposure to violence in media, including books, can impact kids by making them act aggressively and desensitizing them to violence . Further research indicates that adolescents with higher violence acceptance were more likely to be rejected by their classmates than adolescents with low violence acceptance . Banning books with graphic depictions of violence can help create a safer and more supportive learning environment, as violence desensitization poses a risk to children’s mental health. By reducing this exposure, we can foster a more positive and nurturing atmosphere, conducive to better learning outcomes and social interactions.<br><br>Third, parents have the right to guide their children's education and protect them from inappropriate content. While schools aim to provide diverse materials, parental rights are paramount in safeguarding their children's well-being. If books with inappropriate material are available in libraries, children or teens can be exposed to books their parents wouldn’t approve of before the parents even find out what their children are reading . In fact, on the question of book bans in schools and school libraries, 63% of parents agree that bans infringe on their rights as parents . Parental rights are already in place in most school districts: if parents do not want their child to read a text that the class has been assigned, they can ask for an alternative option, and if they do not want their child to check out specific books from the school library, they can ask for restrictions to be placed on their own children’s access . Banning inappropriate books empowers parents to ensure their children are not exposed to material that conflicts with their values or beliefs.<br><br>In conclusion, banning certain inappropriate books in schools is not about censorship;<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a classroom where the doors to new worlds are slammed shut, where diverse voices are silenced, and where students are discouraged from thinking for themselves. This is the chilling reality we risk creating by banning books in schools. We stand firmly against banning specific books, particularly those addressing complex topics like sex, violence, and drug use. Let's start by dissecting what our opponents define as "inappropriate books"—those they claim are "unsuitable for children and adolescents due to their potential to cause harm or negatively influence their development." This definition is not only vague but also deeply subjective. What one person deems harmful, another might recognize as a valuable opportunity for learning and personal growth.<br><br>First, banning books severely limits students' freedom to explore diverse ideas and perspectives. Sheltering children from challenging content actually hinders their ability to develop crucial critical thinking skills. As highlighted in a *2024 study by American University*, controversial literature is vital in developing critical thinking skills, encouraging students to analyze complex themes, challenge societal norms, and engage in meaningful discussions. The study *found that exposure to challenging content significantly enhances students' ability to analyze complex issues*. Banning books diminishes the quality of education students have access to and restricts their exposure to important perspectives. These perspectives include different cultures, lifestyles, and experiences, which are important for students to understand and respect. Exposure to diverse viewpoints, even those considered controversial, allows students to analyze, evaluate, and form their own opinions. Banning books stifles this intellectual growth, directly contradicting the goal of preparing students for informed participation in society. According to *research in 2023*, 78 percent of students are reading more when given the choice to read banned books, *showing that they are more engaged to read those types of content*.<br><br>Second, we firmly believe that teachers are trained professionals fully capable of selecting appropriate materials for their students. Trusting educators' expertise in curriculum development and age-appropriate content allows for flexible and responsive learning experiences tailored to specific student needs. The *National Coalition against Censorship* rightly points out that decisions about classroom materials should be based on professional judgment and standards, not individual preferences.<br><br>Third, banning books simply does not address the root causes of societal problems like violence and drug use. Focusing solely on censorship ignores the complex social, economic, and environmental factors that contribute to these issues, ultimately hindering the development of effective solutions. *Sonya Douglass, Professor of Education Leadership at Teachers College*, explains in *2023* that book bans diminish the quality of education students have access to and restrict their exposure to important perspectives. The opposition's strategy of banning books assumes that removing content eliminates the problem. However, censorship often backfires. Banned books often become more desirable and sought after. Removing books doesn't address the root causes of issues like violence or drug use.<br><br>In conclusion, banning books is not a solution; it's a disservice to our students. Instead, let's empower them with the tools they need to navigate the complexities of the world, fostering empathy, critical thinking, and a lifelong love of learning.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws regarding the definitions used, the freedom of exploration, and how they address the root cause, all of which undermine their arguments.<br><br>First, while the opposition claims our definition of "inappropriate books" is vague, we clarify that we are referring to books containing *explicit* depictions or *endorsements* of sex, violence, or drug use unsuitable for children. *Gender Queer: A Memoir* is one such example . Does it develop critical thinking skills, or does it expose children to harmful or sexually explicit content? While subjectivity exists, there's a core of materials that are undeniably harmful. Numerous studies on the use of graphic material by students indicate negative psychological effects, including having more casual sex partners and beginning sex at younger ages . Therefore, our definition provides a reasonable and necessary boundary to protect child welfare.<br><br>Second, the opposition emphasizes "freedom to explore diverse ideas," but we argue that child welfare must take precedence. Our ban focuses on content with explicit themes, while students can still expand critical thinking skills from other books. A *2021 study* shows the novel, *To Kill a Mockingbird* as being one of the most influential books in American classrooms, showing the theme of racism without being overly explicit . The opponents create a false dilemma by implying it's either banning all books or allowing any book. We advocate for a narrow ban on truly inappropriate materials. After all, a dead or psychologically damaged child has no freedom to explore anything.<br><br>Third, the opposition claims banning books doesn't address the root causes of societal problems like violence and drug use. Exposure to violence in media, including in books, can impact kids by making them act aggressively and desensitizing them to violence . Banning books can be seen as treating the symptom  while we work on addressing the root causes of societal problems. We are preventing the harm that comes from exposure to inappropriate material.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Alright, let's get to work. The opposition's case has some serious flaws that we need to address. Their proposal to ban certain books based on content is not only misguided but also potentially harmful to students' development and critical thinking skills. We will show that their arguments rely on vague definitions, ignore the importance of diverse perspectives, and fail to address the root causes of societal problems.<br><br>First, let's talk about this "inappropriate books" definition. They claim it's clear, but it's still incredibly vague. What one person considers "explicit," another might see as educational. This definition remains subjective, no matter how they try to spin it. Their definition is still too broad. Who decides what's "unsuitable"? It opens the door to censorship based on personal beliefs, not objective standards. As *CSCanada* mentioned in a 2023 article, the subjectivity of literary interpretation is influenced by formal interconnectedness and public sphere to a great extent. This means that what is considered inappropriate can vary widely depending on cultural and social contexts. Therefore, a blanket ban based on such a vague definition is inherently problematic.<br><br>Second, they argue that banning books protects children's welfare, but at what cost? Banning books limits students' freedom to explore diverse ideas and hinders critical thinking. By removing these resources, we are not keeping children safe, rather, not allowing them to become resilient to real-world challenges. What happens when they encounter these issues outside of school? Will they be prepared to handle them? In fact, according to *research in 2023 from Silenced Voices: Ripples of Book Ban*, one of the primary casualties of book bans is the stifling of critical thinking skills in young minds. Literature, with its diverse array of perspectives and ideas, serves as a crucible for the development of analytical thinking. Moreover, *an article from MTSU* points out that opponents of bans argue that by restricting information and discouraging freedom of thought, censors undermine one of the primary functions of education: teaching students how to think for themselves.<br><br>Third, their argument that banning books addresses the "symptoms" of societal problems is misguided. Banning a book doesn't stop violence or drug use. Instead, it ignores the real issues. Censorship often backfires, making banned books more desirable. Removing the content does not stop the cause. Furthermore, it deprives students of the opportunity to engage with complex issues in a safe and educational environment. According to *Baylor University's Academy for Teaching and Learning*, when dealing with sensitive topics, and especially in the case of controversial topics, students are introduced to content that has no “right answer.” This encourages critical thinking not only about the content, but also about themselves.<br><br>Also, teachers are trained professionals. They know what's best for their students. *Reading Rockets* emphasizes that the intentional selection and use of materials is central to the development of the literacy-rich environment. Teachers ensure that students have access to a variety of resources by providing many choices. We trust our trained educators to select appropriate materials that foster critical thinking and prepare students for the challenges they will face.<br><br>Finally, we are protecting child welfare too. We are equipping them with the tools to navigate complex issues. It's not just about shielding them, it's about preparing them. By exposing students to diverse perspectives, we help them develop empathy, understanding, and the ability to navigate a complex world.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the balance between protecting child welfare and promoting freedom of exploration in education.<br><br>The core of our argument rests on the definition of "inappropriate books." While the opposition claims our definition is vague, we specify books containing *explicit* depictions or *endorsements* of sex, violence, or drug use, providing examples like "Gender Queer" . While complete objectivity is impossible, a "reasonable person" standard—what a responsible parent or educator deems inappropriate—should guide us. Studies show that graphic material has negative psychological effects, including early sexual activity . The opposition's "diverse ideas" are also subjective.<br><br>The debate centers on child welfare versus freedom. We argue that a harmed child has no freedom. A *2021 study* shows *To Kill a Mockingbird* addresses racism without explicitness . The opposition creates a false dilemma. Age-appropriate materials can foster critical thinking. We're prioritizing safety and parental rights.<br><br>Finally, we acknowledge banning books won't solve societal problems. However, exposure to violence in media impacts children negatively . It's a preventative measure, like guardrails on a bridge.<br><br>Ultimately, we champion responsible education, balancing freedom with protection, and prioritizing child welfare.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we've heard two very different visions for our children's education. Our opponents propose banning "inappropriate books" from schools, but this vague term is a slippery slope. What one person considers unsuitable, another might see as a crucial opportunity for learning and growth. This subjectivity opens the door to censorship based on personal beliefs, not educational value.<br><br>We believe true child welfare means more than just shielding children. It means equipping them with the critical thinking skills they need to navigate a complex world. Banning books doesn't make children safer; it leaves them unprepared to grapple with difficult issues and form their own informed opinions. As *educational psychologist Dr. Lisa Miller argued in a 2021 study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health*, "Exposure to diverse perspectives fosters empathy and resilience in young people."<br><br>Our opponents suggest banning books addresses the symptoms of societal problems. However, censorship is a superficial solution that fails to tackle the root causes. In fact, as *reported by the American Library Association in 2022*, banning books often backfires, making the forbidden content even more appealing to curious minds.<br><br>We trust our teachers. They are trained professionals equipped to select appropriate materials and foster critical thinking in their students. As *stated by the National Education Association in their 2023 policy brief*, educators are best positioned to make informed decisions about what their students read.<br><br>Therefore, this debate is about intellectual freedom. It's about empowering students to explore diverse ideas, challenge assumptions, and develop their own informed opinions. We choose enlightenment, not censorship. We choose preparation, not protection. We choose freedom, and we urge you to do the same.</div>
