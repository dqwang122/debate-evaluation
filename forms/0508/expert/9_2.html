                        <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                        <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <h6>Summary</h6>
                        <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                        <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that artists should be free to borrow from cultures other than their own. We define "cultural borrowing" as the act of taking aspects of a culture that is not one's own and using them for one's own purpose. In the context of art, this refers to artists incorporating elements—styles, motifs, techniques, etc.—from other cultures into their work. This definition acknowledges the inherent act of influence and exchange, which is not inherently negative but requires careful consideration of respect and context.<br><br>Our judging criteria is the promotion of global artistic innovation and cross-cultural understanding. The most desirable outcome is to encourage an environment where art fosters innovation through cultural exchange while simultaneously promoting respect and understanding between cultures. Arguments will be evaluated on their ability to demonstrate how artistic borrowing contributes to a richer, more interconnected global artistic landscape and fosters intercultural dialogue. This framework prioritizes artistic growth and cultural harmony.<br><br>First, cultural exchange fosters artistic innovation. When artists borrow from other cultures, they create new and innovative artistic expressions. This fusion of styles and techniques leads to the evolution of art forms and the creation of novel works that would not be possible without cross-cultural influence. For example, Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble exemplifies positive cultural borrowing by collaborating with musicians from countries along the historical Silk Road . Such collaborations not only honor diverse musical traditions but also create new and innovative musical experiences. Moreover, Vincent van Gogh’s rendering of a print by Hiroshige demonstrates how artists can creatively reinterpret and integrate elements from different cultural traditions . The blending of cultures fosters innovation and new artistic expressions, which supports a more diverse and dynamic artistic world . Therefore, cultural exchange and borrowing serve as essential catalysts for artistic evolution.<br><br>Second, art serves as a catalyst for cross-cultural understanding. Artistic borrowing, when done respectfully and thoughtfully, promotes understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures. It allows artists to explore and interpret different traditions, sharing those interpretations with a wider audience and fostering dialogue. Studies show that cross-cultural influences in art promote understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures . By bringing together artists from different cultures, these collaborations can help to break down barriers and promote understanding . Art remains a catalyst for a more understanding and interconnected global community by exposing individuals to different cultures, fostering shared experiences, and challenging preconceptions . Thus, cultural borrowing, when approached with respect and understanding, enriches both the artist and the audience, fostering greater cross-cultural empathy and awareness.<br><br>Third, restricting cultural borrowing stifles artistic growth and expression. Imposing limitations on what artists can borrow from other cultures would hinder creativity and innovation. Art thrives on inspiration and exchange, and restricting these processes would lead to stagnation and a less vibrant artistic world. Consider the impact on movements like Cubism, which drew heavily from African art. Limiting such inspiration would impoverish artistic expression and prevent the development of groundbreaking styles. International collaboration helps artists in many ways: in professional development, meeting people who work in the same field but under different conditions, and in generating new ideas and creating a sense of community . By allowing artists the freedom to explore different cultures,<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The motion before us today is whether artists should be free to borrow from cultures other than their own. We stand firmly against this proposition. While cultural exchange can seem positive, the concept of "free borrowing" often masks the potential for harm, exploitation, and the perpetuation of existing inequalities.<br><br>First, let's address the critical distinction between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation. While appreciation involves genuine understanding and respect, appropriation occurs when elements of a non-dominant culture are used in a way that reinforces stereotypes, contributes to oppression, or disrespects their original meaning. As *Verywell Mind reported in 2024*, cultural appropriation often lacks credit to the source and can be deeply offensive . Even well-intentioned cultural borrowing can unintentionally cause harm because artists often lack sufficient understanding of the cultural context and significance of what they're borrowing. For example, a musician might use a sacred melody from an Indigenous culture in a pop song without grasping its spiritual meaning. This isn't about intent; it's about impact. To prevent unintended disrespect and harm, we must be extremely cautious about cultural borrowing.<br><br>Second, we must spotlight how "free borrowing" allows dominant cultures to profit from the creativity of marginalized cultures. The freedom to borrow often translates into dominant cultures exploiting the artistic expressions of marginalized communities for economic gain, without fair compensation or recognition. *ScienceDirect* highlights this exploitation, noting that dominant groups often view subordinated cultures as resources to be mined, leading to economic disadvantages for those communities . Consider fashion brands that appropriate Indigenous designs without acknowledging or fairly compensating the communities who originated them. The result is profit for the dominant culture, while the marginalized culture sees its heritage commodified and exploited. This economic exploitation deepens existing power imbalances.<br><br>Third, it's crucial to realize that focusing on borrowing distracts from addressing systemic inequalities faced by marginalized artists. The debate over cultural borrowing can divert attention from the more pressing need to address systemic inequalities and lack of opportunities faced by artists from marginalized communities. As discussed in "*Open to Debate*", the focus on cultural appropriation can distract from the real injustices, such as the lack of opportunities and funding for marginalized artists . If a Native American artist struggles to get funding for their traditional art while a non-Native artist profits from Native American-inspired art, is that a fair system? We believe the focus should be on leveling the playing field for marginalized artists, not simply celebrating cultural exchange.<br><br>Finally, let's address the argument that responsible cultural borrowing is always beneficial. Proponents of free borrowing might argue that it fosters cultural exchange and artistic innovation. However, research from *PMC in 2023* reveals that cultural borrowing in the fashion industry often raises concerns about cultural misappropriation, lack of recognition and compensation for original cultures, and the perpetuation of power imbalances . Therefore, even seemingly responsible borrowing can perpetuate harm. This requires not only caution in borrowing from other cultures but also proactive measures such as increased funding for Native American arts programs, scholarships for marginalized artists, and policies that ensure fair compensation for cultural intellectual property.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three key flaws, which are an overly broad definition of cultural appropriation, a false dichotomy between cultural exchange and addressing systemic inequalities, and an exaggeration of the harms of cultural borrowing.<br><br>First, the opposition defines cultural borrowing as inherently exploitative, but this definition is far too broad and fails to acknowledge the positive aspects of cultural exchange. They claim that "free borrowing" always leads to harm , yet they provide insufficient evidence of *intentional* exploitation. In fact, cultural exchange fosters innovation and enriches artistic expression . Restricting artistic expression also causes harm by stifling creativity and limiting opportunities for cross-cultural understanding. For example, Yo-Yo Ma's Silk Road Ensemble exemplifies respectful collaboration, honoring diverse musical traditions while creating innovative musical experiences . Furthermore, the claim that all cultural borrowing is inherently negative is simply untrue . Therefore, we should embrace cultural exchange while remaining mindful of potential pitfalls, rather than imposing blanket restrictions.<br><br>Second, the opposition argues that focusing on cultural borrowing distracts from addressing systemic inequalities faced by marginalized artists , but this presents a false dichotomy. We can and should simultaneously promote responsible cultural exchange and work to level the playing field for marginalized artists. These goals are not mutually exclusive. In fact, cultural exchange can provide marginalized artists with greater exposure and opportunities. Moreover, restricting cultural borrowing could disproportionately harm marginalized artists by limiting their access to broader artistic markets and potential collaborations. By fostering a more interconnected and understanding global art scene, we can create more opportunities for artists from all backgrounds to thrive . So, let us not limit artistic expression under the guise of equity, but rather promote inclusivity and opportunity through collaboration.<br><br>Third, the opposition exaggerates the harms of cultural borrowing, failing to recognize its potential benefits. They focus on extreme examples of appropriation, distracting from the many instances of respectful and beneficial cultural exchange. The benefits of cultural exchange are clear: it fosters understanding, promotes diverse artistic innovation, and enhances global community connections . Restricting cultural exchange, on the other hand, can lead to cultural isolation and stifle creativity. The opposition's argument is a straw man, exaggerating our position to make it easier to attack. Therefore, it is crucial to foster an environment that encourages cultural exchange and understanding, rather than imposing limitations that stifle artistic growth and expression .<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Okay, let's break down why the opposition's arguments about cultural borrowing fall short and why our stance against it is essential for protecting vulnerable communities.<br><br>First, let's address the claim that we exaggerate the harms of cultural borrowing. Even well-intentioned actions can have negative consequences. The opposition overlooks the power imbalances inherent in these situations. An artist's intentions don't negate the potential for disrespect and the perpetuation of stereotypes if they lack a deep understanding of the cultural context. As *Health* reported, cultural appropriation reinforces stereotypes and may negatively impact mental health. It's not enough to be simply mindful; artists must actively engage with and understand the cultures they are borrowing from. Cultural products are never devoid of their original context. Ethical considerations are paramount, and restricting harmful behaviors, even unintentional ones, is ethically sound. Consider the example of wearing Native American-inspired war bonnets. Even when done to support body modification, it can be deeply offensive to the originating culture.<br><br>Second, we must emphasize that "free borrowing" often leads to the exploitation of marginalized cultures' creativity for profit by dominant cultures. The core issue is the potential for exploitation. Dominant cultures can benefit from the artistic expressions of marginalized groups, turning their heritage into commodities. As *EmoryBusiness.com* pointed out in 2024, cultural borrowing is more likely to be criticized if the person doing it benefits more from it than the people from the culture they are borrowing from.<br><br>Third, focusing solely on cultural borrowing distracts from the crucial need to address systemic inequalities faced by marginalized artists. The art world is far from a level playing field; resources and opportunities are not equally distributed. By prioritizing cultural exchange alone, we ignore the urgent need to level the playing field. *Culture Appropriation in Popular Media* indicates that cultural appropriation practices lead to commodification, distortion, and the erasure of the original cultural meaning, as well as their effects on the identity and psychological well-being of the affected groups.<br><br>Furthermore, their judging criteria prioritize global artistic innovation and cross-cultural understanding above all else. This is a dangerous approach. It places aesthetics over ethics, and artistic growth cannot be valued at the expense of the rights and well-being of marginalized communities. We need ethics *alongside* aesthetics.<br><br>Finally, they argue that our definition is too broad, but they miss the point: regardless of "intentional exploitation" or ignorance, the impact on marginalized communities can still be harmful. It is our responsibility to prevent such harm. Even unintentional harm is unacceptable, and artists must educate themselves to avoid causing it. As the *Ethics of Cultural Heritage* explains, misrepresentation can present a culture in a false or misleading light, traffic in prejudices and stereotypes, or present a cultural practice in a context that perverts its meaning.<br><br>So, support artists from marginalized communities *so you can boost the economy of that specific community while advancing art for everyone*, donate to organizations that promote cultural preservation *so you can help preserve the culture*, and most importantly, educate yourselves and others about the complexities of cultural appropriation *so you can avoid causing unintentional harm*.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. In today's debate our discussion primarily revolved around the role of cultural borrowing in art and its effects on both artistic innovation and cultural equity. The core of our disagreement lies in defining cultural borrowing and its impact. The opposition paints a picture where any act of borrowing inevitably leads to exploitation. We disagree. While the potential for harm exists it's a slippery slope to suggest that all borrowing is inherently exploitative. Such a stance ignores the countless instances where artists respectfully engage with other cultures. Creating new and innovative works that benefit all. Moreover to assume only harm comes of it means any artistic endeavor has the potential to cause harm. Like the environmental impact of art supplies. The benefits of cultural exchange like yo-yo ma silk road ensemble are clear. It fosters understanding promotes diverse artistic innovation. An enhances global community connections 3:1. We advocate for responsible engagement not a blanket band that stifles creativity. Furthermore the opposition creates a false dichotomy between supporting cultural borrowing and addressing systemic inequalities. We can and should do both. Restricting cultural borrowing could disproportionately harm marginalized artists by limiting their access to broader artistic markets and potential collaborations. In fact support through cultural exchange can help to preserve cultures. If artists from marginalized communities are supported through cultural exchange it will help to preserve their cultures. Ultimately artistic innovation cannot be divorced from ethical considerations we contend that true innovation challenges existing power structures. And promote social justice. Are vision prioritizes global artistic innovation and cross-cultural understanding.<br><br></div>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In conclusion, we firmly oppose the idea of artists freely borrowing from other cultures, because it often masks harm and perpetuates inequality. This debate isn't about artistic freedom, but about ethical responsibility. The opposition champions unchecked "free borrowing," but this ignores the inherent power imbalances at play.<br><br>The most crucial issue is that focusing solely on cultural borrowing distracts from addressing systemic inequalities. This debate isn't about stifling art; it's about leveling the playing field so marginalized artists can thrive. Even well-intentioned actions don't negate negative consequences. The opposition conveniently overlooks that actions, even with good intentions, can have negative outcomes. Intent doesn't excuse cultural appropriation.<br><br>The other side has repeatedly argued that cultural borrowing should be supported. However, as we've demonstrated, that doesn't mean we should give free rein to any act of cultural borrowing. Regardless of intent, the impact on marginalized communities can be harmful, and we have a responsibility to prevent this harm. As you consider our arguments, understand the core of the debate: ethics must come first. It's particularly important to recognize that even unintentional harm is unacceptable, and artists must educate themselves to avoid causing it.<br><br>The opposition falsely claims we create a dichotomy. It’s not *either/or*! Prioritizing marginalized artists does not mean all art needs to stop. We simply want to ensure that marginalized communities get equal opportunities.<br><br>Therefore, we urge you to stand with us in prioritizing ethics, equity, and the well-being of marginalized communities.</div>
