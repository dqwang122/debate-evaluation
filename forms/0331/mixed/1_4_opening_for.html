                                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children, meaning that parents, defined as those with legal guardianship and custody responsible for a child's upbringing, should be held accountable for the consequences of their children's actions that cause physical, emotional, or financial damage.<br><br>Our judging criteria is Utilitarianism. We believe the resolution should be judged based on which side maximizes overall societal well-being and minimizes harm. Holding parents responsible for their children's harmful actions should be supported if it leads to a greater good for society as a whole by deterring negative behavior and promoting responsible parenting.<br><br>First, parental responsibility deters harmful behavior in children. Holding parents accountable incentivizes them to actively monitor, guide, and discipline their children, reducing the likelihood of harmful actions. A study by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare examined 16 States that had enacted civil parental liability statutes and compared the rate of juvenile crime in those States with those in the rest of the country . The study revealed that parental responsibility laws aim to deter juvenile delinquency by holding parents accountable, potentially improving parental monitoring and behavior control . Further supporting this, charging parents could serve as a deterrent, encouraging them to take a more active role in preventing their children from engaging in criminal activities . Thus, parental responsibility creates a proactive environment that minimizes harm.<br><br>Second, parental responsibility encourages better parenting. When parents are held accountable, they are more likely to invest in their children's upbringing, teaching them moral values and social responsibility. This leads to a more well-adjusted and productive citizenry, maximizing overall well-being. Parental responsibility includes setting clear rules to deter undesirable child behavior . Effective deterrence relies on consistent enforcement and clear consequences . A 2017 study following 317 mothers and their teenage sons over two and a half years, revealed that a high-quality mother-son relationship reduced youths’ reoffending over time . This reinforces the idea that engaged and responsible parenting has tangible positive effects on child behavior, fostering better citizens.<br><br>Third, parental responsibility provides justice for victims. Holding parents accountable can provide restitution or compensation to victims of their children's harmful actions. This offers a sense of justice and helps to alleviate the burden on victims, contributing to a more just and equitable society. As Knowable Magazine  highlights, with parental culpability laws, if a child hurts someone or damages property, restitution can be provided to the victim. Furthermore, Penal Code § 490.5 covers shoplifting and Education Code § 48904 makes parents liable for injury or death caused by the willful act of child to any fellow pupil or school employee, showing existing legal frameworks support holding parents accountable for the harm their children cause . Therefore, making parents responsible provides a tangible means of support and acknowledges the harm suffered by victims.<br><br>In conclusion, for the reasons of deterring harmful behavior, encouraging better parenting, and providing justice for victims, we strongly affirm the resolution that parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Nolo.com.

                                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Every year, countless children are involved in incidents that cause harm to themselves and others, incidents that leave lasting scars on individuals and communities. Are we doing enough to prevent this harm? Today, we stand firmly in support of the resolution: "Parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children," because parental responsibility is a crucial part of the solution.<br><br>To clarify our position, we define "responsible" not merely as bearing the blame after an incident, but as encompassing the legal and moral obligation to proactively prevent harm. This includes taking reasonable steps to nurture responsible behavior and ensure children understand the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Our judging criterion is simple: which side’s arguments best promote the overall well-being and safety of children and society as a whole? We believe our arguments will demonstrate a clear path to achieving this crucial outcome.<br><br>Holding parents accountable encourages early intervention to address behavioral issues. Think of it this way: A stitch in time saves nine. If parents know they may be held responsible for their children's actions, they are far more likely to address concerning behaviors early on, preventing escalation into more serious harm. We can see the story that a child who gets parent's guidance is different from a child who doesn't get parent's guidance.<br><br>Financial liability compels parents to actively supervise their children, reducing negligence. Imagine responsibility as a garden. A gardener plants the seeds of character and conscience. Weeds of negligence will inevitably sprout, but a diligent hand will pluck them before they choke the garden. Financial liability motivates parents to be that vigilant gardener, actively tending to their children's development and preventing harmful actions from taking root. Remember the tragic case of Ethan Crumbley, whose parents were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to address his clear warning signs.<br><br>Parental responsibility incentivizes parents to teach children to be responsible digital citizens. In the digital age, this is paramount. Consider the rise of cyberbullying and online exploitation. By making parents responsible, we incentivize them to actively teach their children about safe online behavior and the consequences of cyberbullying. From the printing press, radio, television, to the current AI, each new technology presents opportunities for both good and harm. Just as societies had to develop norms for responsible use of the printing press, parents now must guide their children to be responsible digital citizens, understanding the consequences of their online actions. Studies show that children younger than 11 years old who use Instagram and Snapchat are more likely to have problematic digital behaviors like having online-only friends and visiting sites parents would disapprove of, as well as a greater chance of taking part in online harassment . This highlights the critical need for parental involvement in shaping children's online habits. Furthermore, research indicates that excessive screen time and unsupervised screen exposure can be disruptive to a child's development .<br><br>In conclusion, we firmly believe that holding parents responsible for the harmful actions of their children is not about punishment, but about prevention. It’s about creating a society where children are raised with a strong sense of responsibility and respect for others, and where parents are empowered to guide them effectively. For the safety and well-being of our children and our communities, we urge you to support this resolution.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Kate Eshleman, PsyD, "How Social Media Can Negatively Affect Your Child," *Cleveland Clinic*, January 15, 2024.<br>[2] Edyta Swider-Cios, Anouk Vermeij, Margriet M.
