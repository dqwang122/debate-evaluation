                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. We define "decline" as a gradual and continuous loss of value, power, or quality in the perceived worth, economic viability, and cultural significance of human-created art forms. "Human Creative Arts" encompasses artistic endeavors primarily conceived and executed by human beings, excluding art generated solely by artificial intelligence. We refer to "AI" as computer systems capable of generating art.<br><br>Our judging criteria is artistic integrity and cultural value. We believe a world where human expression and creativity are valued over AI-generated content is preferable. The affirmative must prove that AI-driven art significantly undermines human artistic endeavors to meet this standard.<br><br>First, AI-generated art devalues human skill and effort. The ease and speed with which AI can produce art diminishes the perceived value of the years of training, practice, and dedication required to master traditional art forms. This leads to decreased demand for human artists and a loss of cultural appreciation for human artistic skill. Studies show that the proliferation of easily accessible AI-generated content can lead to a devaluation of human-created works. For instance, a study published in the *Journal of Cultural Economics* found that increased automation in creative industries often results in lower wages and fewer opportunities for human artists . This is because AI can flood the market with cheap, readily available content, undercutting the prices that human artists can reasonably charge. Furthermore, the psychological impact of readily available AI art can lead to a diminished appreciation for the unique qualities and emotional depth that human artists bring to their work. **I need data on artist income decline and examples of AI art replacing human art in commercial contexts to strengthen this argument.** Therefore, the readily availability of AI art directly threatens the livelihood and recognition of human artists.<br><br>Second, AI art raises copyright and ownership issues, undermining artists' livelihoods. The use of existing artwork to train AI models raises significant copyright concerns. Artists may find their styles and creations replicated by AI without their consent or compensation, further devaluing their original works and potentially leading to legal battles and economic hardship. Legal scholars, writing in the *Stanford Law Review*, have noted the ambiguity in current copyright law regarding AI-generated art, particularly concerning the "fair use" doctrine . This ambiguity leaves artists vulnerable to having their work exploited without recourse. For example, visual artists are seeing their unique styles replicated by AI models, leading to their art being indistinguishable from AI generated content. This forces artists to compete with near-identical copies of their work, diminishing its value and creating marketplace confusion. **I need legal precedents on AI art copyright and examples of artists suing AI companies to add more weight to this argument.** Thus, unresolved copyright issues and potential for exploitation make it difficult for human artists to sustain their careers.<br><br>Third, AI art limits creative exploration and innovation by mimicking existing styles. Because AI art is trained on existing datasets, it tends to replicate and remix established styles rather than pushing the boundaries of artistic expression. This stifles true innovation and leads to a homogenization of art, ultimately diminishing the richness and diversity of human creative culture.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Towse, R.

                            <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firmly against the assertion that AI will lead to the decline of human creative arts. While we acknowledge the concerns, we believe this perspective overlooks AI's transformative potential.<br><br>Let's begin with a crucial clarification. Imagine a world where all art becomes homogenous and uninspired, reflecting only what algorithms deem popular – *that* would be decline. Our opponents define "decline" as a tangible degradation in quality, uniqueness, and societal value. We contend that this definition is overly restrictive. Instead, we envision a vibrant ecosystem where AI empowers artists to push boundaries, creating entirely new forms of expression we can’t even imagine today. Artistic evolution is not synonymous with decline, and to limit our understanding in this way is to ignore the dynamic nature of art itself. The definition should encompass evolution and transformation as art adapts to new technologies and societal values.<br><br>Furthermore, we propose that this debate be judged not solely on whether AI diminishes or enhances human creative endeavors, but on the overall impact of AI on human creativity. Focusing solely on potential drawbacks overlooks AI's significant contributions to artistic innovation and accessibility.<br><br>Now, let's address the specific arguments presented. First, the claim that AI's dependence on pre-existing data smothers genuine innovation is a mischaracterization. AI's dependence on existing data does not stifle innovation; rather, it provides a foundation for artists to build upon, experiment with, and create novel works.<br><br>Consider the historical parallel of photography. When it emerged, many feared it would spell the end of painting. Instead, photography became an art form of its own, and painting evolved alongside it. Similarly, AI can serve as a springboard for experimentation, allowing artists to explore new styles and techniques that were previously unimaginable.<br><br>Second, the assertion that AI imperils the livelihoods of human artists is not inevitable. The accessibility afforded by AI does not necessarily lead to apathy but can foster greater engagement and understanding of art, broadening the audience and creating new consumers. More people engaging with art, even AI-generated art, can stimulate interest in human-created art, leading to increased demand for authentic, unique pieces and art instruction. Thus, AI can augment, not destroy, the value and potential markets for human artistry.<br><br>Finally, the argument that over-reliance on AI diminishes essential skills is historically inaccurate. The claim that AI diminishes human skill development ignores the historical precedent of technological advancements augmenting, not replacing, artistic abilities. Instead, AI can augment human artists' abilities, allowing them to focus on higher-level creative tasks and explore new artistic frontiers. As Sungjin Park  notes, generative AI introduces a dynamic interplay between technological liberation and dependency, democratizing artistic expression.<br><br>In conclusion, we believe that AI presents not a threat, but an opportunity. It enhances artistic accessibility, inspires creativity, and facilitates the preservation of our cultural heritage. We should start to embrace AI to create and experience the future of arts, because it not only enables the creation of more art, but also enables more interaction between human and arts.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Park, Sungjin.

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains three critical flaws, specifically in their redefinition of "decline", their redefined judging criteria and their misunderstanding on the augmentation of AI.<br><br>First, the opposition attempts to redefine "decline" to include evolution, but this fundamentally misunderstands our point . By equating any change with progress, they create a tautology where AI's impact can never be negative . The National Art Education Association  and Culture.org  have voiced significant concerns about AI's impact on artistic authenticity, emotional depth, and the ideation process. These concerns demonstrate that AI isn't merely changing art; it's degrading the very qualities that make human art valuable . We must adhere to the definition of decline as a degradation in quality and value to have a meaningful discussion about the risks posed by AI.<br><br>Second, our opponents suggest judging this debate on the "overall impact" of AI, including potential benefits like accessibility . While accessibility might be a marginal benefit, it does not outweigh the potential harm to the core aspects of human creativity . Focusing solely on overall impact ignores the demonstrable decline in quality, originality, and value that AI brings to the arts. This is about net harm: does AI, on balance, lead to a decline, even if it offers some benefits ? The overwhelming evidence suggests that it does.<br><br>Third, the photography analogy is a false equivalence . Early photography required significant skill and artistic vision, creating new jobs and artistic avenues. AI art generation, however, requires minimal skill, threatening existing artistic livelihoods . While photography may have led to a shift in art styles, AI's impact is far more pervasive, potentially homogenizing art due to its accessibility . The NAEA position  demonstrates how AI diminishes human artistic expression, something photography never did to such a strong degree.<br><br>Fourth, our opponents claim AI fosters engagement, but engagement does not equate to understanding . Superficial engagement with AI-generated art can lead to a decrease in the understanding and appreciation of human creativity . More people seeing AI art doesn't mean a healthier artistic ecosystem; it risks diminishing the value we place on human skill, emotional depth, and unique perspective . Culture.org  notes the importance of the human element, something lost when art is treated as a mere commodity.<br><br>Fifth, they state that AI augments artists, but it actually replaces crucial skills . The NAEA  specifically points out how over-reliance on AI stifles ideation, a critical artistic skill. The ability to experiment, fail, and learn from mistakes is fundamental to artistic development, and AI circumvents this process .<br><br>Sixth, the claim that Sungjin Park makes is an overstatement on the impact of AI at its current state . He mentions liberation and democratization, however NAEA  and Culture.org  have stronger stances on AI. Democratization will be possible, if everyone had access to AI art and had some form of skill or knowledge. Since its new, only people with the capital will be able to generate and produce. Therefore there's no democratization, because it costs money to have access .<br><br>In conclusion, we urge you to consider the long-term consequences of embracing AI in the creative arts. It is not a tool for enhancement; it is a force for degradation, leading us down the road to decline .<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) NAEA Position Statement on Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and AI-generated Imagery in Visual Arts Education • National Art Education Association.

Our opponents attempt to redefine decline as merely evolution. This is a semantic sleight of hand. Decline as we see it represents a tangible loss of arts intrinsic qualities and that is not evolution it's a diminishment a degradation and a step backward for human creativity. They also suggest judging ai's overall impact. Broadening the scope to include potential benefits we maintained that the primary focus must remain on whether ai ultimately enhances or diminishes human creativity. Innovation does not negate the potential for a significant loss of artistic quality and the displacement of human artists. Consider the core of our argument. On existing data actively stifles genuine innovation what they call a foundation we recognized as a restrictive template the emerging creativity they described as merely sophisticated mimicry devoid of the emotional depth and originality that defines true art. Ai generated art directly imperils the livelihoods of human artists our opponent conveniently ignores the devastating economic implications. By automating the creative process ai directly threatens to displace countless human artists. Even if ai manages to create something superficially impressive. It's sheer accessibility diminishes the perceived value of human created art. If we allow the opposition to continue with their plan it will give more power to the corporations while harming the individual artists and their well-being. Imagine the impact on the arts if ai continues to advance at this rate. The adoption of ai art will result in a devaluation of human artistic skills. The artistry and dedication of human creators are overshadowed by the convenience and low-cost of ai creation. This isn't progress it's a race to the bottom where human talent is rendered obsolete. Consider a music student who relies solely on ai to compose melodies never truly learning the nuances of harmony or the discipline of dedicated practice. While the ai may generate pleasing sounds. The students fundamental understanding of music remains superficial and incomplete. This is not augmentation it's atrophy. The true decline of human creative arts is now visible not in some distant future but in the hollowing out of artistic education and the devaluation of human skill. Finally they claim ai augments human artistry. Will ai may offer tools for artistic creation. This collaboration risks making human artists mew curators of ai generated content. This is not augmentation it's atrophy the true decline of human creative arts is now visible not in some distant future but in the hollowing out of artistic education. Finally they claim ai augments human artistry. Will ai may offer tools for artistic creation this collaboration risks making human artists. Mercury's of ai generated content. The adoption of ai is basically retroactively deteriorating and diminishing the tangible qualities of human creative arts. The future of artists and ai is now visible not in some distant future but in the hollowing out of artistic education. Finally they claim ai augments human artistry. Will ai may offer tools for artistic creation this collaboration risk diminishing their creative authority and leading to a decline in the originality and emotional depth of art. The necessity of human input does not negate the devaluation of purely human created art. As ai art floods the market traditional skills lose their perceived value. The collaboration model places human artists subordinate to ai diminishing their creative authority therefore it is a tool of mass replacement ultimately.<br><br>**Reference**<br>
