                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate we shall argue that parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children. We define parental responsibility. As the legal and moral obligation of parents to provide appropriate care supervision guidance and discipline to their children. And to be held accountable for the consequences of failing to fulfill these obligations particularly when their children's actions cause harm. This includes both intentional and negligent acts. We define harmful actions as actions by children whether intentional or unintentional. That cause physical emotional or financial damage to individuals property or the community. Are judging criteria is based on utilitarianism. Maximizing overall societal well-being and minimizing harm. The side that demonstrates the greatest potential to reduce harmful actions by children and improve the overall safety and well-being of society should win the debate holding parents responsible incentivizes actions that lead to better outcomes for all. First holding parents responsible for their children's harmful actions deters both the children and the parents from engaging in or allowing such behavior. Parental responsibility laws aim to deter juvenile delinquency by holding parents accountable. Potentially improving parental monitoring and behavior control. Charging parents could serve as a deterrent encouraging them to take a more active role in preventing their children from engaging in criminal activities. This aligns with the utilitarian framework by minimizing harm through prevention. Deterrence theory suggests that consequences reduce undesirable behavior. Well specific statistics on the impact of parental responsibility laws on juvenile delinquency rates are mixed. The potential for deterrence is significant further research quantifying this deterrent effect would strengthen this argument. Therefore holding parents accountable can lead to a reduction in harmful actions second holding parents responsible ensures accountability for the harm caused by their children and provides a sense of justice for the victims. When a child causes harm holding the parents accountable provides a mechanism for restitution and acknowledges the victims suffering this promotes societal well-being by ensuring victims are compensated and those responsible are held accountable? Fostering a more just and equitable society. For example the prosecution of the crumbly parents while still unfolding highlights the potential for holding parents accountable when their negligence contributes to their child's harmful actions specific legal analysis of such cases detailing the legal precedence and the impact on victims would further bolster this argument. Thus parental accountability provides justice and reduces the overall harm to society. 3rd parental responsibility laws incentivize parents to be more actively involved in their children's lives providing better supervision guidance and moral education supporters of parental responsibility statutes believe that family conditions are the most predictive component of a child's behavior and that parents have a responsibility to provide positive guidance. Holding parents accountable encourages them to take a more active role in shaping their children's behavior instilling values and providing necessary supervision. Social learning theory suggests children learn behaviors from their parents the study published in 2017 followed mothers and their teenage sons and revealed that a high-quality mother-son relationship reduced youths re-offending over time. Therefore by holding parents accountable we encourage them to model and teach prosocial behaviors resulting in a better safer society.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Charging Parents For Child’s Crime.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand today to affirm that parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children. By "harmful actions," we mean those that inflict physical, emotional, or financial damage on another person or property. And by "responsible," we advocate not for draconian punishment, but for a system of accountability that cultivates proactive parenting. The central question of this debate is: Which approach best ensures the safety and well-being of both children and the broader community? We firmly believe that holding parents accountable is fundamental to fostering responsible behavior in children.<br><br>Firstly, parental responsibility encourages early intervention. Neglecting a child's emerging behavioral issues is akin to ignoring a persistent leak in your home – a small problem that, if left unaddressed, can lead to extensive and costly damage. By holding parents accountable, we incentivize them to address these issues early, preventing escalation into more serious offenses. For instance, a child repeatedly caught shoplifting small items might, without intervention, progress to more serious crimes. Parental accountability encourages engagement with school counselors, behavioral therapists, or other resources to correct the behavior before it hardens into a pattern.<br><br>Secondly, financial liability compels parents to actively supervise their children, thereby reducing negligence. Consider instances where parental negligence directly contributed to harmful outcomes. For example, holding parents accountable for vandalism committed by their children can lead to increased involvement in after-school activities and monitoring of their children's whereabouts. This isn't about punishing parents; it's about fostering an environment where active supervision is the norm.<br><br>Finally, parental responsibility incentivizes parents to cultivate responsible digital citizenship in their children. The digital world is now inextricably linked to our physical reality, and its impact on children is profound. According to child psychologist Kate Eshleman, PsyD, children younger than 11 years old who use Instagram and Snapchat are more likely to have problematic digital behaviors like having online-only friends and visiting sites parents would disapprove of, as well as a greater chance of taking part in online harassment . Moreover, constant exposure to idealized images and lifestyles on social media can contribute to negative body image, self-esteem issues, and anxiety around social acceptance, particularly in preteens . By holding parents accountable, we motivate them to educate their children about online safety, prevent cyberbullying, and promote responsible online interactions. This includes setting boundaries on screen time, monitoring online activity, and teaching children about the potential consequences of their digital actions.<br><br>We recognize that some may argue against parental responsibility due to socioeconomic disparities or the inherent challenges of raising children. However, these challenges do not negate the fundamental responsibility of parents to nurture and guide their children. Accountability, within reasonable limits, serves as a vital incentive for proactive parenting. It is not about blaming parents, but about empowering them to shape their children into responsible, law-abiding citizens.<br><br>Therefore, we urge you to support this motion, to advocate for policies that empower parents to raise responsible children, and to build a safer and more accountable society for all.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Kate Eshleman, PsyD, child psychologist.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that parents should *not* be held responsible for the harmful actions of their children. We believe such a policy is detrimental to the development of individual responsibility, unfairly punishes disadvantaged families, and is less effective than alternative solutions.<br><br>We define **harmful actions** as actions that cause physical, emotional, or financial damage to another person or property. We define **responsibility** as the state or fact of being accountable or to blame for something.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **protecting individual autonomy and promoting effective solutions.** The debate should be judged on which side better protects the individual autonomy of children while promoting effective solutions that address the root causes of harmful behavior and foster individual accountability. We contend that holding parents responsible undermines these crucial goals.<br><br>First, **holding parents responsible undermines the development of individual accountability in children.** When parents are held liable, children may not fully grasp the consequences of their actions or learn to take responsibility for them. This can hinder their moral development and future decision-making skills. Legal systems recognize individual accountability . Teaching children accountability and emphasizing individual choices are more effective alternatives. Responsibility lies in understanding and guiding, not blaming parents . By shielding children from the direct consequences of their actions, we prevent them from learning vital lessons about personal responsibility, which is crucial for their development into responsible adults.<br><br>Second, **parental responsibility laws can disproportionately and unfairly punish parents from disadvantaged backgrounds.** Factors such as poverty, lack of access to resources, and systemic biases can limit a parent's ability to control a child's behavior. It's unfair to hold parents responsible when children act without understanding, like in cases of severe cognitive impairment or when parents are unaware and unable to control the situation . Holding parents responsible for children's actions can lead to increased parental stress and anxiety and it may also strain family relationships and reduce effective parenting . Such laws can create a cycle of disadvantage, further marginalizing already vulnerable families.<br><br>Third, **alternatives to parental responsibility, such as restorative justice and community-based programs, are more effective in addressing harmful behavior and promoting positive change.** These approaches focus on repairing harm, fostering empathy, and providing children with the support and resources they need to make better choices. Studies show parental responsibility laws may not significantly impact child behavior . Alternatives include teaching children accountability, focusing on peer influence, and emphasizing individual choices . These methods promote genuine accountability and rehabilitation, rather than simply assigning blame.<br><br>In conclusion, holding parents responsible for the harmful actions of their children undermines individual accountability, unfairly punishes disadvantaged families, and is less effective than alternative solutions. We urge you to consider the detrimental consequences of this approach and instead, embrace solutions that foster individual responsibility and promote positive change within our communities.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) FindLaw.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We firmly oppose the proposition that parents should be held solely responsible for the harmful actions of their children. While the desire to cultivate responsible behavior is understandable, focusing exclusively on parental blame is not the most effective or equitable solution.<br><br>Let's begin by clarifying key terms. The definition of "harmful actions" as simply inflicting physical, emotional, or financial damage is excessively broad. We must consider a child's intent and maturity. Was the action driven by malice, or was it a thoughtless mistake? For example, is a child's intent to share versus steal relevant when determining the severity of the action? Similarly, defining "responsibility" solely as proactive parenting neglects the crucial role of community support systems, available resources, and broader systemic factors. Should responsibility include community support programs designed to assist families?<br><br>Therefore, the central question of this debate should be: Which approach most effectively fosters responsible behavior in children while ensuring fairness and equity for all involved?<br><br>Consider the profound impact of socioeconomic factors on a parent's capacity to guide their children. A parent working multiple jobs to make ends meet often lacks the time and resources to closely supervise their child's activities. Is it just to hold that parent solely accountable for actions that arise from circumstances largely beyond their control? Data indicates a strong correlation between poverty and limited parental resources.<br><br>Children learn responsibility most effectively through supportive guidance, not through punitive measures imposed by parents. Punishment can breed resentment and defiance, hindering genuine personal growth. Studies show that punishment can lead to increased resentment and defiance in children. Isn't it more beneficial to cultivate empathy and understanding in a child through constructive dialogue and mentorship? Think of it like nurturing a plant: it thrives with sunlight and water, not constant reprimands.<br><br>Furthermore, placing sole blame on parents undermines restorative justice approaches. These approaches delve into the underlying causes of harmful actions, aiming to repair the harm done and reintegrate the child into the community. They offer a more effective and humane path forward than simply assigning blame.<br><br>The argument that parental responsibility will lead to more community support assumes that only parental responsibility can incentivize community support, but that is not necessarily true; other ways can improve it. Focusing solely on incentivizing community support through parental responsibility ignores the immediate harm of unjustly punishing parents, especially given existing socioeconomic disparities.<br><br>Attributing responsibility solely to parents overlooks the significant influence of societal factors, such as peer pressure and media exposure, on a child's behavior. It also disregards the evolving autonomy of adolescents as they mature. Imposing blanket responsibility on parents, even when they have made reasonable efforts to provide guidance and support, can lead to unfair and counterproductive outcomes.<br><br>For these compelling reasons, we urge you to oppose this motion and instead support community-based solutions that address the root causes of harmful actions. For the reasons we mentioned, we hope to change your mind to focus on community-based solutions.<br>***<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] [Source Name], [Journal Name].<br>***

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four key flaws. They misinterpret our definition of responsibility, propose a flawed judging criteria, and fail to recognize the crucial role of parental accountability in restorative justice.<br><br>First, the opposition claims our definition of "harmful actions" is too broad and doesn't consider intent. But this ignores established legal precedents . Parental responsibility laws hold parents accountable for a child's actions, even without malicious intent, recognizing the parent's duty to supervise. For instance, if a parent negligently leaves a firearm accessible, leading to accidental harm, they are held accountable, irrespective of the child's intent . Our definition, therefore, aligns with legal reality, focusing on the outcome and the parental duty to prevent it.<br><br>Second, they suggest a judging criteria that prioritizes "fairness and equity" over the safety and well-being of the community. We believe that safety and well-being are paramount. A society cannot be considered equitable if it is not safe. Further, our proposal of "accountability within reasonable limits" already addresses fairness concerns, ensuring that consequences are proportionate and considerate of individual circumstances. By focusing on safety, we create an environment where fairness can truly flourish, thus our criteria encompasses their concerns.<br><br>Third, the opposition argues socioeconomic factors negate parental responsibility. We recognize these challenges, which is precisely why our proposal emphasizes "accountability, not draconian punishment." A parent's socioeconomic situation will be considered when determining the appropriate accountability measures. Moreover, we reject the notion that poverty inherently equates to negligent parenting. Many parents in challenging circumstances demonstrate exceptional dedication. Our approach provides resources and support to empower parents, not to unfairly punish them.<br><br>Finally, they contend that parental responsibility undermines restorative justice. This is a false dichotomy. Parental accountability is integral to effective restorative justice. Requiring parents to participate in restorative justice conferences, ensure restitution, or oversee community service reinforces their responsibility and promotes healing. Parental involvement strengthens the restorative process, ensuring a more comprehensive and lasting resolution.<br><br>Therefore, we urge you to uphold the motion, recognizing that parental responsibility is not about blame, but about empowerment, accountability, and a safer, more responsible society.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Williams v.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The opposition suggests that socioeconomic factors negate parental responsibility, but this argument misses a critical point. It's not about ignoring the very real challenges that families face. It's about empowering parents, regardless of their circumstances, to guide their children's lives. To say we cannot expect parents to be responsible because of socioeconomic factors is simply untrue. It's like saying we shouldn't offer financial aid for college because some students come from disadvantaged backgrounds. Challenges don't eliminate responsibility; they underscore the need for greater support and a clear expectation of accountability. We cannot allow the pursuit of a "perfect" solution to prevent us from implementing a "good" one.<br><br>Let's be clear: Parental responsibility isn't about assigning blame. It's about actively influencing a child's behavior. When parents are held responsible, they are more likely to engage with their child's school, seek assistance from community centers, and create a supportive home environment. This helps shape the child's environment to counteract potentially harmful societal factors. Therefore, holding parents accountable is a key mechanism for addressing societal influences.<br><br>Furthermore, the opposition claims that we oversimplify the issue by focusing on parents. However, parental responsibility isn't about ignoring external factors; it's about empowering parents to mitigate those influences. By holding parents accountable, we encourage them to actively counter negative peer pressure, monitor media consumption, and instill positive values. For example, creating a shared family media plan is one way to encourage critical thinking about media consumption . This addresses the source of many harmful behaviors rather than merely reacting to the symptoms.<br><br>Consider the case of a single mother working multiple jobs. Holding her accountable doesn't mean we expect perfection. It means we encourage her to seek support from community programs, to communicate effectively with her child's school, and to prioritize her child's well-being, even amidst challenges. This proactive approach benefits both the child and the community.<br><br>Moreover, parental responsibility encourages early intervention, preventing minor offenses from escalating into serious crimes by encouraging engagement with resources like counselors and therapists. Financial liability compels parents to actively supervise their children, reducing negligence and increasing involvement in their activities, especially concerning actions like vandalism. Parental responsibility encourages parents to cultivate responsible digital citizenship, educating children about online safety and preventing cyberbullying. Studies show that excessive screen use and unsupervised screen exposure are disruptive to a child's development .<br><br>Finally, the opposition claims the debate should focus on the most effective approach while emphasizing fairness and equity. But focusing solely on the "most effective approach" while emphasizing "fairness and equity" overlooks the crucial role of parental accountability in actively shaping children's behavior and ensuring community safety. We must prioritize both effectiveness and accountability. It's not an either/or situation. It's a both/and.<br><br>Therefore, we stand firm in our belief that parental responsibility is vital for raising responsible children and building a safer society.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">al<br>Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttals still cling to a simplistic view of parental responsibility, overlooking the real-world challenges and unintended consequences. We will demonstrate that their approach is not only less effective but also less fair, ultimately undermining the very goals they seek to achieve.<br><br>First, the opposition claims socioeconomic factors don't negate parental responsibility, but instead underscore the need for more support. However, this misses our central point: Solely assigning responsibility without providing adequate resources is not only ineffective but also inequitable. It's like giving someone a broken car and then blaming them for not arriving on time. Studies show that low-income parents often work multiple jobs and face significant time constraints . Holding them solely "accountable" for their children's actions, without acknowledging these limitations, is simply setting them up to fail. We agree support is needed but it should not be assumed that all parents have the capacity to supervise their child at all times.<br><br>Second, the opposition argues that parental responsibility actively influences behavior through engagement with schools and communities. But this assumes that all parents possess the knowledge, resources, and time to engage effectively . A parent working two jobs may not be able to attend school meetings or research the best community programs. Moreover, even with parental engagement, societal factors such as peer pressure and pervasive advertising can still have a significant impact. Community programs, on the other hand, can directly address these societal influences by providing education, resources, and support to all children, regardless of their parents' involvement. Therefore, community support helps mitigate harmful societal factors.<br><br>Third, they state that holding parents accountable encourages them to seek support and prioritize their child's well-being. We never said that parents should not prioritize the safety of their child. Our view is that community support is equally if not more vital. However, the single mother example illustrates the limitations of solely assigning responsibility. Holding her "accountable" without offering tangible assistance can lead to undue stress and potential punishment, such as fines or legal action, that ultimately harms the family. Community programs, such as early intervention initiatives, can identify at-risk children and families and provide support regardless of parental accountability .<br><br>Therefore, for the reasons we mentioned, we hope to change your mind to focus on community-based solutions.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Emma Kalish, et al.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firm that parents should not bear sole responsibility for the harmful actions of their children. The opposition suggests socioeconomic factors should not negate parental responsibility, but this misses a critical point: while empowering parents is a worthy goal, socioeconomic circumstances significantly limit their ability to effectively guide their children. To simply state that challenges don't eliminate responsibility ignores the reality that these challenges create vastly unequal playing fields. It is inherently unfair to assign blanket responsibility without acknowledging these limitations.<br><br>The definition of "harmful actions" is also too broad. It fails to account for the immaturity and potential misunderstanding of intent a child can have, or differing mental and emotional levels of childhood development. A child's actions are not always a reflection of parental guidance, but rather a consequence of their developmental stage and understanding of the world.<br><br>The opposition claims that holding parents accountable encourages them to seek support, but this does not proactively guarantee addressing the root causes. This incentive argument contains a logical fallacy: affirming the consequent. There is no evidence to suggest that parental responsibility alone can effectively catalyze community support. By focusing solely on incentivizing community support through parental responsibility, our opponents ignore the immediate harm of unjustly punishing parents, especially given the socioeconomic disparities we outlined.<br><br>Furthermore, the opposition's argument that parental responsibility actively shapes children's behavior fails to account for the significant influence of societal factors. The influence of media is massive. Children spend a significant amount of time online, highlighting the substantial influence of digital media. This exposure inevitably shapes their perspectives and behaviors, often in ways that parents cannot fully control. Their argument places undue emphasis on parental influence, while minimizing the substantial impact of a child's environment beyond the home. By not accounting for these external factors, the link between accountability and change in child behavior is broken.<br><br>Our opponents also dismiss our emphasis on how restorative justice is more helpful, and how punishment can cause harm to a child. Restorative justice brings together the victim, the offender, and community members to repair the harm caused by the offense. This approach focuses on rehabilitation and reconciliation, rather than simply assigning blame and punishment. It addresses the underlying causes of harmful behavior and promotes healing for all parties involved.<br><br>We must also consider the potential harm that punishment can inflict on a child. Punitive measures can lead to resentment, alienation, and a cycle of negative behavior. They fail to address the root causes of the problem and can ultimately be counterproductive.<br><br>Therefore, we maintain our position: the debate should focus on identifying the most effective and equitable approach. We must consider intent and maturity, along with the importance of community support, and how to minimize punishments for families who are already struggling. We urge you to reject the notion of blanket parental responsibility and instead embrace a holistic approach that addresses the root causes of harmful actions and provides equitable solutions for all families. A holistic approach is needed that doesn't unduly burden families, but provides true, effective, and equitable solutions.<br><br>**Reference**<br>

No revisions are needed.",<br> "closing_statement": "Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around how best to ensure the well-being of children and the safety of our communities. The opposition has presented compelling arguments, but we maintain that parental responsibility is not only vital but also the most effective path forward.nnThe first battleground concerns the definition of "harmful actions." We want to be clear: our definition is not overly broad. It applies to actions where there is a clear pattern of harmful behavior or a demonstrable lack of parental intervention. An accidental mishap or an isolated incident with no malicious intent would not fall under this definition. Our concept of "responsibility" is similarly proactive. It's about guidance, seeking support, and taking action within one's means, not solely about punishment.nnThe second key battleground is the impact of socioeconomic factors. We acknowledge the very real challenges that many families face. However, these challenges do not negate the fundamental responsibility of parents to guide their children. We firmly believe in empowering parents, regardless of their circumstances, to seek out available support systems. Communities often provide resources like school programs and online support . Even with limited resources, taking some action is better than none, and parental responsibility encourages that action.nnThirdly, while we acknowledge the significant influence of societal factors like media and peers, parental responsibility empowers parents to mitigate these influences. Setting screen time limits, discussing media critically, and encouraging positive peer relationships  are all ways parents can create a buffer against harmful influences.nnFinally, let's address the concern about punishment versus restorative justice. These approaches are not mutually exclusive.<br><br>**Reference**<br>Digital Parenthood.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The crux of this debate isn't about ignoring socioeconomic challenges; it's about whether those challenges absolve parents of their fundamental responsibilities. Our opponents suggest they do, but we stand firm: hardship doesn't erase accountability. Instead, it underscores the urgent need for robust support systems *alongside* clear expectations for parental involvement. Raising children is about actively navigating difficulties with available resources, not excusing inaction.<br><br>While restorative justice offers a path forward after harm is done, our approach is about prevention. We aim to empower parents to positively influence their children's lives *before* problems arise. Consider this: is it better to react to a crisis, or to proactively mitigate the risks? By focusing on parental responsibility, we address the root causes of many issues, not just the aftermath.<br><br>The opposition champions fairness, but let's examine what true fairness entails. Is it fair to children deprived of guidance due to parental negligence, excused by socioeconomic factors? Is it fair to communities burdened by the repercussions of unchecked behavior?<br><br>We ask you to consider the larger implications. Socioeconomic challenges are undeniable, but parental responsibility, fortified by community support, is indispensable. It's about fostering a society where children are nurtured, guided, and held accountable, and where parents are empowered to build brighter futures for their children and their communities. Therefore, we emphatically affirm the motion.<br><br><br>[1]

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around whether parents should bear sole responsibility for their children's harmful actions.<br><br>The core clash centered on socioeconomic factors. Our opponents ignore the crushing weight of poverty, where parents have limited time and resources to supervise their children. How can we justly hold these parents solely accountable? Their so-called "empowerment" rings hollow when parents face systemic disadvantages.<br><br>Another battleground is defining "harmful actions" and "responsibility." The affirmative's blanket definition is unjust, potentially criminalizing childhood. "Responsibility" must include community support and systemic changes, not just proactive parenting.<br><br>This leads us to effectiveness: parental responsibility vs. community-based solutions. The affirmative argues that parental responsibility magically incentivizes community support, which is a logical leap. Community support provides childcare and mental health for families. The affirmative focuses on the incentive but minimizes the impact of a child's environment. We argue tending to that environment is more effective.<br><br>Finally, we address punishment vs. rehabilitation. The affirmative's approach leads to punitive measures harming children. Restorative justice offers healing and addresses root causes.<br><br>Judges, we advocate for a just, equitable, and effective system recognizing the limitations of parents facing socioeconomic challenges and prioritizing community-based solutions.<br><br>The choice is clear: stand with us for a holistic approach. Vote negative.<br><br><br>```<br><br>**Reference**<br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Here's a revised closing statement based on your feedback and guidelines:<br><br>We've shown that holding parents solely responsible for their children's harmful actions is not only unfair but also ineffective. Our opponents argue that hardship doesn't negate accountability, but they fail to acknowledge the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities. These disparities create an uneven playing field, where some parents face insurmountable challenges in guiding their children.<br><br>The definition of "harmful actions" remains vague, ignoring crucial factors like a child's maturity and intent. The opposition has not provided a clear framework for assessing these nuances. While they suggest community support would be incentivized by parental accountability, their argument overlooks the immediate harm inflicted on families already struggling with socioeconomic disadvantages.<br><br>Our approach prioritizes fairness and effectiveness through community support and restorative justice. Restorative justice focuses on rehabilitation and reconciliation, preventing alienation caused by undue punishment and blame. This approach acknowledges broader societal influences, such as peer pressure and media exposure, which the opposition largely ignores in their emphasis on parental influence.<br><br>Consider the kind of society we want to build. Do we punish families facing hardship and scapegoat parents? Or do we offer equitable solutions, community support, and restorative justice? We urge you to reject a system that perpetuates inequality and embrace an approach that fosters genuine rehabilitation and support. Vote against the motion.
