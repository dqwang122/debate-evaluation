                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children, meaning that parents, defined as those with legal guardianship and custody responsible for a child's upbringing, should be held accountable for the consequences of their children's actions that cause physical, emotional, or financial damage.<br><br>Our judging criteria is Utilitarianism. We believe the resolution should be judged based on which side maximizes overall societal well-being and minimizes harm. Holding parents responsible for their children's harmful actions should be supported if it leads to a greater good for society as a whole by deterring negative behavior and promoting responsible parenting.<br><br>First, parental responsibility deters harmful behavior in children. Holding parents accountable incentivizes them to actively monitor, guide, and discipline their children, reducing the likelihood of harmful actions. A study by the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare examined 16 States that had enacted civil parental liability statutes and compared the rate of juvenile crime in those States with those in the rest of the country . The study revealed that parental responsibility laws aim to deter juvenile delinquency by holding parents accountable, potentially improving parental monitoring and behavior control . Further supporting this, charging parents could serve as a deterrent, encouraging them to take a more active role in preventing their children from engaging in criminal activities . Thus, parental responsibility creates a proactive environment that minimizes harm.<br><br>Second, parental responsibility encourages better parenting. When parents are held accountable, they are more likely to invest in their children's upbringing, teaching them moral values and social responsibility. This leads to a more well-adjusted and productive citizenry, maximizing overall well-being. Parental responsibility includes setting clear rules to deter undesirable child behavior . Effective deterrence relies on consistent enforcement and clear consequences . A 2017 study following 317 mothers and their teenage sons over two and a half years, revealed that a high-quality mother-son relationship reduced youths’ reoffending over time . This reinforces the idea that engaged and responsible parenting has tangible positive effects on child behavior, fostering better citizens.<br><br>Third, parental responsibility provides justice for victims. Holding parents accountable can provide restitution or compensation to victims of their children's harmful actions. This offers a sense of justice and helps to alleviate the burden on victims, contributing to a more just and equitable society. As Knowable Magazine  highlights, with parental culpability laws, if a child hurts someone or damages property, restitution can be provided to the victim. Furthermore, Penal Code § 490.5 covers shoplifting and Education Code § 48904 makes parents liable for injury or death caused by the willful act of child to any fellow pupil or school employee, showing existing legal frameworks support holding parents accountable for the harm their children cause . Therefore, making parents responsible provides a tangible means of support and acknowledges the harm suffered by victims.<br><br>In conclusion, for the reasons of deterring harmful behavior, encouraging better parenting, and providing justice for victims, we strongly affirm the resolution that parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Nolo.com.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Every year, countless children are involved in incidents that cause harm to themselves and others, incidents that leave lasting scars on individuals and communities. Are we doing enough to prevent this harm? Today, we stand firmly in support of the resolution: "Parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children," because parental responsibility is a crucial part of the solution.<br><br>To clarify our position, we define "responsible" not merely as bearing the blame after an incident, but as encompassing the legal and moral obligation to proactively prevent harm. This includes taking reasonable steps to nurture responsible behavior and ensure children understand the consequences of their actions.<br><br>Our judging criterion is simple: which side’s arguments best promote the overall well-being and safety of children and society as a whole? We believe our arguments will demonstrate a clear path to achieving this crucial outcome.<br><br>Holding parents accountable encourages early intervention to address behavioral issues. Think of it this way: A stitch in time saves nine. If parents know they may be held responsible for their children's actions, they are far more likely to address concerning behaviors early on, preventing escalation into more serious harm. We can see the story that a child who gets parent's guidance is different from a child who doesn't get parent's guidance.<br><br>Financial liability compels parents to actively supervise their children, reducing negligence. Imagine responsibility as a garden. A gardener plants the seeds of character and conscience. Weeds of negligence will inevitably sprout, but a diligent hand will pluck them before they choke the garden. Financial liability motivates parents to be that vigilant gardener, actively tending to their children's development and preventing harmful actions from taking root. Remember the tragic case of Ethan Crumbley, whose parents were charged with involuntary manslaughter for failing to address his clear warning signs.<br><br>Parental responsibility incentivizes parents to teach children to be responsible digital citizens. In the digital age, this is paramount. Consider the rise of cyberbullying and online exploitation. By making parents responsible, we incentivize them to actively teach their children about safe online behavior and the consequences of cyberbullying. From the printing press, radio, television, to the current AI, each new technology presents opportunities for both good and harm. Just as societies had to develop norms for responsible use of the printing press, parents now must guide their children to be responsible digital citizens, understanding the consequences of their online actions. Studies show that children younger than 11 years old who use Instagram and Snapchat are more likely to have problematic digital behaviors like having online-only friends and visiting sites parents would disapprove of, as well as a greater chance of taking part in online harassment . This highlights the critical need for parental involvement in shaping children's online habits. Furthermore, research indicates that excessive screen time and unsupervised screen exposure can be disruptive to a child's development .<br><br>In conclusion, we firmly believe that holding parents responsible for the harmful actions of their children is not about punishment, but about prevention. It’s about creating a society where children are raised with a strong sense of responsibility and respect for others, and where parents are empowered to guide them effectively. For the safety and well-being of our children and our communities, we urge you to support this resolution.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Kate Eshleman, PsyD, "How Social Media Can Negatively Affect Your Child," *Cleveland Clinic*, January 15, 2024.<br>[2] Edyta Swider-Cios, Anouk Vermeij, Margriet M.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we argue that parents should not be held primarily responsible for the harmful actions of their children. While parental guidance plays a crucial role, holding parents solely accountable undermines individual responsibility, strains families, and distracts from addressing underlying societal issues.<br><br>Our judging criteria is based on balancing individual accountability with parental influence. We believe the side that provides the most compelling argument for fostering responsible behavior in children, while recognizing the limits of parental control and upholding individual accountability, should prevail.<br><br>First, holding parents solely responsible undermines children's individual accountability. Attributing blame exclusively to parents absolves children of learning from their mistakes and developing personal responsibility. This hinders their moral development and future decision-making. Children need to understand the consequences of their actions to develop into responsible adults. Blaming parents shifts the focus away from the child's behavior, hindering their ability to learn and grow. Studies in developmental psychology show that a sense of personal responsibility is crucial for moral development . When children aren't held accountable, they are less likely to internalize moral standards and make responsible choices in the future.<br><br>Second, parental responsibility laws can have unintended negative consequences on families. Holding parents responsible can lead to increased stress, financial strain, and strained relationships within the family, potentially hindering effective parenting. A study by the American Psychological Association found that increased stress levels in parents can lead to less effective parenting practices . For example, in states with strict parental responsibility laws, families may experience increased conflict and resentment, undermining the supportive environment children need to thrive.<br><br>Third, focusing on systemic factors offers a more effective solution. Addressing societal issues like poverty, lack of educational opportunities, and exposure to violence offers a more comprehensive approach to preventing harmful actions by children than solely blaming parents. Research indicates that children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to engage in harmful behavior due to limited opportunities and exposure to negative influences . According to the Children's Defense Fund, investing in early childhood education, providing access to quality healthcare, and creating safe communities can significantly reduce youth crime rates . Instead of solely punishing parents, we should focus on addressing the root causes of harmful behavior.<br><br>In conclusion, while parental guidance is essential, holding parents primarily responsible for their children's harmful actions undermines individual accountability, strains families, and distracts from addressing underlying societal issues. A more balanced approach that emphasizes individual responsibility, supports families, and addresses systemic factors will be more effective in fostering responsible behavior in children.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Bandura, A.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Our opponents claim that making parents liable for their children's harmful actions will curb youth misbehavior. We stand firmly against this oversimplified solution. It ignores the complex realities of families and the true drivers of youth behavior. We must consider a more just and effective approach.<br><br>The opposition likely defines "harmful actions" broadly. We contend that this definition is far too wide. Holding parents accountable for every misstep, regardless of severity or circumstance, is fundamentally unjust. A minor infraction is not the same as a violent crime, and parental responsibility should not be a blanket solution.<br><br>Furthermore, their argument likely rests on a utilitarian framework, aiming to maximize societal well-being. While a desirable goal, it cannot come at the expense of individual rights and fairness. Sacrificing the well-being of some families to supposedly benefit the majority is not justice. We advocate for a restorative justice approach that prioritizes healing and rehabilitation over blame and punishment.<br><br>First, they argue that parental liability deters harmful behavior. This assumes parents have complete control over their children's actions, which is simply not true. As children grow, they are influenced by peers, schools, and the broader community. Holding parents solely responsible ignores these external factors and fails to address the root causes of harmful behavior. Instead of deterrence through punishment, we need to focus on child rehabilitation. This means investing in programs that address the underlying issues, such as mental health support, counseling services, and educational resources. Shifting the focus to parental liability distracts from the crucial work of rehabilitating the children themselves.<br><br>Second, they claim that parental responsibility encourages better parenting. This argument ignores the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities on a parent's ability to supervise and guide their children. Consider a single parent working tirelessly at two jobs just to provide basic necessities. They simply cannot offer the same level of supervision as a family with ample resources. Holding these parents to the same standard is not only unfair but also ignores the systemic inequalities that contribute to youth misbehavior. Imposing liability creates a punitive environment, not a supportive one. It punishes parents who are already struggling, rather than providing them with the resources they need to succeed.<br><br>Finally, they argue that parental responsibility provides justice for victims. While justice is paramount, focusing solely on parental blame undermines restorative justice. Restorative justice seeks to repair the harm caused by an offense and reintegrate the offender back into the community. Imagine a scenario where a child commits an act of vandalism. Traditional justice focuses on punishment. Restorative justice, on the other hand, brings together the child, the victim, and community members to understand the impact of the child's actions and find ways to make amends. This process fosters empathy, accountability, and healing, offering a more constructive path forward for everyone involved.<br><br>Therefore, we firmly oppose this resolution. We must reject simplistic solutions that punish struggling families and instead embrace a more nuanced approach that prioritizes rehabilitation, restorative justice, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior.<br>#<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Zehr, Howard. *Changing Lenses: A New Focus for Crime and Justice*.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the negative side's arguments contain three key flaws: their narrow definition of "harmful actions", their rejection of the utilitarian framework, and their misunderstanding of parental responsibility in the context of restorative justice.<br><br>First, the opposition claims our definition of "harmful actions" is too broad, but this ignores the reality that even seemingly minor infractions can have significant consequences . Moreover, existing legal frameworks, such as Penal Code § 490.5 covering shoplifting and Education Code § 48904 holding parents liable for injury caused to pupils, demonstrate that parental responsibility extends to a range of offenses, not just violent crimes . Failing to address these actions early can lead to escalation, resulting in far greater harm to both the individual and society. Therefore, holding parents accountable for a wider spectrum of harmful actions promotes early intervention and prevents more serious issues from developing.<br><br>Second, our opponents reject a utilitarian framework in favor of restorative justice, yet fail to recognize that these approaches are not mutually exclusive. Restorative justice, which seeks to repair harm and reintegrate offenders, ultimately contributes to overall societal well-being . Parental responsibility enhances restorative justice by ensuring accountability and encouraging parents to actively participate in the healing process. After all, Penal Code § 490.5 and Education Code § 48904 demonstrate existing legal frameworks supporting parental accountability for the harm their children cause . Therefore, we contend that our framework maximizes societal well-being.<br><br>Third, the negative side argues that parents lack complete control over their children's actions and that socioeconomic disparities negate parental responsibility. However, we never claimed parents have *complete* control; our point is that parental involvement significantly *influences* a child's behavior . Studies show a correlation between parental monitoring and reduced delinquency . While socioeconomic factors are important, they do not negate the fundamental responsibility of parents to provide guidance and support. Holding parents accountable, even in challenging circumstances, incentivizes them to seek resources and create positive change.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Nolo.com.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The core issue remains accountability, and we stand firm on this principle.<br><br>First, let's clarify our definition of parental responsibility. We are focusing on significant harm – physical, emotional, or financial – caused by children, not minor missteps. Our position is not that parents are responsible for every misstep, but for preventing and addressing serious harmful actions by their children.<br><br>We believe the best way to approach this issue is by considering what outcome will lead to the greatest overall well-being and safety for our children and communities. This is why we are prioritizing accountability, as it has the potential to prevent future harm. Prioritizing restorative justice *exclusively* ignores the broader societal benefits of deterring harmful behavior through accountability. The claim that sacrificing individual rights for the majority is unjust is unfounded. Accountability *prevents* future harm. It’s a balancing act, not a sacrifice. A society where harmful actions go unchecked ultimately infringes upon the rights of everyone, especially potential victims.<br><br>Now, let’s address the point about parental control. No one is claiming parents have absolute control. However, parental guidance remains a *crucial* influence, regardless of external factors. A gardener cannot control the weather, but they *can* nurture the plant, prune it, and provide the best possible conditions for growth. Holding parents accountable reinforces their *responsibility* to create a safe and supportive environment for their children.<br><br>Removing parental responsibility diminishes the incentive to instill ethical values and monitor activities. This lack of accountability fosters an environment where children are more likely to engage in harmful behavior, thus contradicting the need for responsible upbringing. The content consumed during screen time can also play a crucial role in shaping children’s cognitive and emotional development . Exposure to violent or inappropriate material can have adverse effects, including increased aggression or desensitization to real-world violence .<br><br>Regarding socioeconomic disparities, while these disparities are real, they should not excuse parental negligence. Instead, we must work to provide resources and support to struggling families, not absolve them of their responsibilities. These interventions can be either by government support such as welfare programs, or community support such as after school programs. In fact, holding parents accountable, where possible, can *encourage* resourcefulness and community support to overcome these challenges.<br><br>Finally, restorative justice complements, but it does not *replace*, the need for accountability. Victims deserve justice, and parental responsibility provides a pathway for restitution and a sense of closure. To say we must choose between restorative justice and parental accountability creates a false dichotomy. It's like saying a doctor can only treat the symptoms or the cause of an illness, not both.<br><br>The opposition’s stance diminishes accountability and neglects the vital role of parents in shaping their children's behavior. Their arguments create inconsistencies. They want to reduce parental control, but also want to improve the upbringing of children. These two ideas contradict each other. Thus, we stand by our firm support for the resolution.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Child Psychiatry Today. “Screen time and its long-term effects on children’s health.” June 11, 2024.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">al<br>Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative side's rebuttals fail to address the core issues of fairness and practicality in holding parents responsible for their children's actions. Their arguments contain three critical flaws: their overly broad definition of "harmful actions", their flawed attempt to reconcile utilitarianism with restorative justice, and their dismissal of the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities.<br><br>First, they argue that even minor infractions can have significant consequences and that existing legal frameworks support holding parents accountable for a wide range of offenses. However, this line of reasoning stretches parental responsibility to an unreasonable extent. Are we to believe that a parent should be held financially liable for a schoolyard squabble or a minor act of vandalism ? Such an approach is not only unjust but also impractical. It opens the door to frivolous lawsuits and places undue burden on families, especially those with limited resources. We acknowledge that parents have a role in guiding their children, but holding them fully accountable for every minor misstep is a disproportionate response. A more reasonable approach focuses on addressing serious offenses while providing support and resources to families struggling with behavioral issues. Therefore, we maintain that the affirmative's definition of "harmful actions" is far too broad and leads to unjust outcomes.<br><br>Second, the affirmative claims that utilitarianism and restorative justice are not mutually exclusive and that parental responsibility enhances restorative justice. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of restorative justice principles. Utilitarianism seeks to maximize overall happiness, even if it means sacrificing individual rights. Restorative justice, on the other hand, prioritizes healing and rehabilitation, focusing on repairing the harm caused by an offense and reintegrating the offender back into the community . Simply adding parental liability to restorative justice does not make it more effective; it introduces a punitive element that undermines the core principles of empathy, accountability, and healing. Imagine, the goal is to encourage dialog between victim and offender to restore the community. Parental liability introduces a financial burden and shifts the focus from the child taking responsibility to the parents trying to pay their way out. The two are fundamentally in opposition and the affirmative is wrong to try and mesh them together.<br><br>Finally, the affirmative dismisses the impact of socioeconomic disparities, arguing that parental involvement significantly influences a child's behavior, regardless of circumstances. While parental involvement is undoubtedly important, it is not a panacea. Studies show that factors such as peer influence, school environment, and community conditions play a significant role in shaping juvenile behavior . Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between poverty and crime, indicating that systemic inequalities contribute to youth misbehavior . A single parent working multiple jobs to make ends meet simply cannot provide the same level of supervision as a family with ample resources. Holding these parents to the same standard is not only unfair but also ignores the complex realities of their lives. We must address the root causes of crime, such as poverty, lack of opportunity, and inadequate access to education and mental health services, rather than simply punishing struggling families.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Nolo.com.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The opposition's vision of parental responsibility as a simple solution ignores the complexities of child development and the systemic issues that contribute to harmful behavior. They propose that holding parents liable for their children's actions deters crime, encourages better parenting, and delivers justice. However, this argument crumbles upon closer examination, revealing an oversimplified approach to a multifaceted problem.<br><br>The opposition suggests that even minor infractions warrant parental responsibility, citing existing legal codes. But are we to believe that holding a parent liable for a child's shoplifting is equivalent to addressing violent crime? This is a dangerous overreach, leading to disproportionate punishment and an expansion of governmental power into the private lives of families. A nuanced approach is essential. While minor infractions matter, parental liability is a sledgehammer when a scalpel is needed.<br><br>They misrepresent our position by suggesting we believe parents have *complete* control over their children's actions. We maintain that parents significantly *influence* their children's behavior, but we also recognize the powerful roles of peers, schools, community influences, and individual agency. To equate parental influence with complete control is a gross distortion of reality. Guiding a child is like sailing a ship. The captain sets the course, but storms, currents, and the skill of the crew all affect the journey. Parents play a vital role, but countless external factors are at play.<br><br>Moreover, their focus on parental responsibility completely ignores the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities. Studies show that children from low-income families are disproportionately affected by the juvenile justice system, highlighting the limitations of relying solely on parental responsibility. It is easy to say that parents simply need to "seek resources," but what if those resources are unavailable or inaccessible? Imagine a single mother working two minimum wage jobs, struggling to provide food and housing for her children. Is she truly able to provide the same level of supervision, support, and guidance as a family with ample financial resources? The answer is a resounding no. Punishing this mother for lacking resources is not only unjust, it is counterproductive. It creates worse material outcomes for the child and the family. Offering support, opportunity, and access to resources is a far more effective path.<br><br>Finally, they claim their utilitarian framework maximizes societal well-being, even while conceding that restorative justice has merit. The fundamental flaw in a purely utilitarian view is that it can easily justify sacrificing the rights and well-being of a minority for the supposed benefit of the majority. What happens to those struggling families? What happens to that single mother working two jobs? Do we simply cast them aside in the name of the greater good? True justice demands a more nuanced and equitable approach. Parental liability would overburden single mothers and create worse material outcomes.<br><br>We remain steadfastly committed to a restorative justice framework that prioritizes healing, rehabilitation, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior. This approach is more just, more effective, and more humane than their oversimplified and potentially harmful proposal.<br><br>**Reference**<br>[1] Juvenile Justice Geography: Addressing Disparities in the Juvenile Justice System.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around parental responsibility for the harmful actions of their children.<br><br>The core of our case rests on deterring harmful behavior, encouraging better parenting, and providing justice for victims. We are not advocating for punishing parents for every minor misstep. We are talking about actions with real consequences, where parental negligence plays a clear role. For instance, existing laws already hold parents accountable for shoplifting or property damage . This isn't about disproportionate punishment; it's about proportionate accountability and preventing escalation.<br><br>Parents may not have complete control, but influence, not control, is the key word here. Like sailing a ship, the parent sets the course, prepares the ship, and navigates. A 2017 study, for instance, showed a high-quality mother-son relationship reduced youths’ reoffending . Socioeconomic disparities are a reality, but they do not negate parental responsibility. Holding parents accountable, even in challenging circumstances, incentivizes them to seek resources, access support programs, and create positive change.<br><br>Utilitarianism and restorative justice are not mutually exclusive. Holding parents responsible enhances restorative justice by providing accountability and a pathway to restitution for victims . This ensures those harmed receive justice, allowing offenders to learn and make amends, fostering safer communities for everyone.<br><br>In conclusion, holding parents responsible for the harmful actions of their children deters harmful behavior, encourages better parenting, and provides justice for victims. Ultimately, this promotes a culture of responsibility, creating a safer and more just society for all our children.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) MWL Law. PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY LAWS CHART.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We stand firm: parents must be held responsible for their children's harmful actions. The central debate revolved around parental accountability versus external factors, a challenge we directly addressed. We revealed the critical flaw in the opposition's argument: presenting parental responsibility and community support as mutually exclusive. We have clearly demonstrated that these approaches are mutually reinforcing.<br><br>Our utilitarian framework maximizes societal well-being by ensuring accountability and fostering responsible parenting. The opposition failed to demonstrate that restorative justice alone could achieve this. The study we presented clearly supports the idea that parental responsibility deters children from engaging in harmful activities. This proactive approach benefits everyone.<br><br>The opposition attempts to deflect parental accountability by highlighting socioeconomic disparities. While these challenges are undeniable, they do not negate a parent's fundamental duty. Socioeconomic factors can contribute to harmful behavior, but they do not absolve parents of their responsibility to guide and supervise their children.<br><br>Consider what true justice demands: accountability. It means creating a system where parents are motivated to steer their children toward positive behavior, victims receive restitution, and society as a whole benefits from responsible upbringing. We are not saying that parents are solely to blame, but they must be held accountable for their role in shaping their children's behavior. Therefore, we urge you to affirm the resolution: Parents should be responsible for the harmful actions of their children. Thank you.<br><br><br>[1] Study on parental responsibility and deterrence of harmful activities.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the core issue of whether parents should be held responsible for the harmful actions of their children.<br><br>Our opponents advocate for a broad definition of "harmful actions," suggesting that parental responsibility should extend even to minor infractions. We firmly disagree. As we've demonstrated, such an approach could lead to injustice and abuse . Where do we draw the line? Holding a parent liable for a child's act of shoplifting is hardly equivalent to addressing a violent crime. By focusing on trivial matters, we risk diverting attention and resources from addressing more serious issues that truly threaten our communities.<br><br>Moreover, while our opponents champion a utilitarian framework, we contend that this approach can easily justify sacrificing the well-being of struggling families for the supposed greater good. What happens to the single mother working two jobs?  Do we simply cast her aside? We champion restorative justice, a more humane and effective approach. It prioritizes healing, rehabilitation, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior, not just punishment.<br><br>Finally, our opponents downplay the significant impact of socioeconomic disparities on a parent's ability to supervise and guide their children. It is not only unfair but also counterproductive to punish parents who are already struggling. This creates worse material outcomes for the child and the family .<br><br>We must reject simplistic solutions that punish struggling families and instead embrace a more nuanced approach that prioritizes rehabilitation, restorative justice, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Zehr, Howard. *Changing Lenses: A New Focus for Crime and Justice*.

The opposition insists that holding parents accountable will prevent crime and improve parenting. However, this ignores the complex realities of families and the real reasons behind youth behavior.<br><br>They argue about "influence, not control," but their proposal demands an impossible level of influence. Parents can guide and teach, but they cannot dictate every choice their children make. Holding them responsible for those choices is unfair and ineffective. It creates blame, not support.<br><br>The scope of "harmful actions" is dangerously broad. Are we ready to hold parents accountable for every mistake? This risks disproportionate punishment, especially for struggling families. As  notes, holding parents liable can lead to increased stress and anxiety within families, potentially exacerbating the very issues it seeks to address .<br><br>The opposition relies on a utilitarian idea that sacrifices individual well-being for the supposed good of society. We offer a better solution: restorative justice that prioritizes healing, rehabilitation, and addressing the root causes of harmful behavior. According to , restorative justice programs have shown promise in reducing recidivism rates among young offenders . This approach focuses on repairing harm and reintegrating youth into the community, rather than simply assigning blame.<br><br>Fairness, support, and restorative justice are the right choices. Reject parental liability. Let's focus on solutions that actually work, not on policies that punish families for the actions of their children.<br><br><br>[1] [Source Name].
