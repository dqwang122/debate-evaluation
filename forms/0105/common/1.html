                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice.  Online public opinion trials are defined as situations where legal cases or controversies are extensively discussed and debated in online public forums, potentially influencing legal proceedings or outcomes. This includes social media discussions, online petitions, and citizen journalism efforts related to legal matters. Justice is a state of affairs in which fairness, equity, and the rule of law prevail, ensuring that individuals receive due process, appropriate punishments or remedies, and protection from harm.  "Closer to Justice" means progress towards a more just outcome, increasing fairness, equity, and adherence to the rule of law in legal processes and outcomes.<br><br>Our judging criteria is maximizing societal benefit. The side that best demonstrates a net positive impact on society's pursuit of justice, considering factors like fairness, accuracy, accountability, access to justice, and protection of individual rights, should win.  This framework is appropriate because the motion is fundamentally about whether online public opinion trials improve or hinder the overall effectiveness and fairness of the justice system.<br><br>First, online public opinion trials enhance transparency and accountability within the legal system.  Increased public scrutiny through online platforms holds legal actors accountable, exposes misconduct, and promotes fairness. For example, in 2021, public outcry on social media following the police killing of Elijah McClain contributed to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [1].  Studies show that public pressure resulting from online scrutiny can lead to police reforms and investigations into misconduct [2]. This transparency and accountability are crucial for a just legal system, as highlighted by research on the role of transparency in good governance [3].<br><br>Second, online platforms amplify marginalized voices and facilitate access to justice. Traditional legal processes can be inaccessible or biased against certain groups.  Online platforms provide avenues for marginalized communities to share their experiences, organize legal support, and advocate for their rights.  Research indicates that online campaigns have played a key role in legal reforms benefiting marginalized groups, such as the #MeToo movement raising awareness of sexual harassment and assault [4]. This increased access to justice and amplified voice for the marginalized contributes to a more equitable legal system.<br><br>Third, online public opinion trials facilitate information sharing and public education about legal issues, improving public understanding and engagement with the justice system. Open online discussions about legal cases can educate the public about legal principles, processes, and potential biases, fostering informed participation in legal and political discourse.  For instance, online discussions surrounding high-profile court cases often involve explanations of complex legal concepts, making them more accessible to the general public. This increased awareness ultimately strengthens the pursuit of justice.  A study by [5] demonstrated that online discussions of hypothetical legal problems led to deeper analysis and critical thinking among participants.<br><br>In conclusion, by fostering transparency and accountability, amplifying marginalized voices, and promoting public education, online public opinion trials ultimately contribute to a more just and equitable legal system, bringing us closer to, not further from, justice.<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Change.org.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, judges, esteemed audience, we stand before you today to oppose the motion that online public opinion trials bring us closer to justice. While the proposition paints a rosy picture of increased transparency and amplified voices, we argue that these supposed benefits are overshadowed by the inherent dangers of online trials, which ultimately obstruct the path to true justice.  <br><br>First, let’s clarify what we mean by “online public opinion trials.” We define them as instances where individuals are subjected to public judgment and condemnation online, often based on incomplete information and fueled by emotional responses, before or irrespective of formal legal proceedings.  Our judging criteria today should be minimizing harm.  The side that best demonstrates how their interpretation of online public opinion trials minimizes harm to individuals and the integrity of the legal system should win this debate.  This framework is crucial because justice is not simply about speed or perceived public satisfaction; it's about ensuring fairness, due process, and protecting individual rights.<br><br>Now, let me turn to our first point: online public opinion trials readily devolve into vigilantism. Consider this: you are accused of a crime you didn’t commit, and before you even step into a courtroom, your reputation is tarnished, your life threatened, all based on incomplete information circulating online. Wikipedia's entry on internet vigilantism [1] notes public shaming as a common tactic, highlighting how online platforms are weaponized to enact extrajudicial “justice.”  This bypasses due process, fostering mob rule and undermining the legal system. The speed and reach of online platforms amplify the potential for misjudgment and harassment, creating a climate of fear and intimidation rather than justice.<br><br>This brings me to our second argument: online public opinion trials amplify biases and prejudices. Studies like "Media stereotypes, prejudice, and preference-based reinforcement" [2] show how prejudiced individuals gravitate towards confirming information, creating echo chambers that reinforce existing biases. These platforms prioritize engagement over accuracy, allowing biased narratives to spread rapidly and influence public perception, thus moving us further from impartial justice. Imagine a scenario where you’re judged not on the facts of a case, but on pre-existing biases amplified by algorithms designed to maximize engagement, not truth. That is the reality of online public opinion trials.<br><br>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the crucial issue here is that online public opinion trials disproportionately affect marginalized communities.  They face a double disadvantage. First, as revealed in "Challenges to Continuity During the COVID-19 Pandemic - PMC" [3], many lack access to technology or the skills to navigate online spaces, limiting their ability to participate and counter misinformation. Second, "Introduction: Marginality and Social Media" [4] explains how existing power imbalances are amplified online, increasing their vulnerability to exploitation and online harassment. As you'll see, this combination of exclusion and amplified vulnerability exacerbates existing marginalization and undermines fair representation, moving us further from a just society.  <br><br>In conclusion, while the allure of online public opinion trials might seem appealing on the surface, we believe that their inherent dangers—vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate harm to marginalized communities—pose a significant threat to the very foundations of our justice system.  We urge you to consider the real-world consequences of these trials and stand with us in opposition.<br><br>**Reference**<br><br>[1]  Wikipedia. *Internet vigilantism*. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_vigilantism<br>[2]  Yogeeswaran, Kumar, and Joel S.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent’s opening statement mischaracterizes online public opinion trials, offering a narrow definition, a restrictive judging criterion, and a pessimistic outlook on their potential for good. We, the affirmative team, contend that online public opinion trials, broadly defined, contribute significantly to the pursuit of justice by maximizing societal benefit.<br><br>First, the negative team’s narrow definition of online public opinion trials as mere online judgment and condemnation ignores the multifaceted nature of online discourse related to legal issues.  Our broader definition, encompassing discussions, analyses, and information sharing, is more appropriate because it reflects the reality of how people engage with legal matters online.  Platforms like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and the Electronic Case Filings websites of various courts [2] exemplify this, providing accessible legal information and promoting transparency, thereby fostering a more informed citizenry crucial for a just society. By excluding these vital functions, the negative’s definition weakens their argument. Our broader definition, encompassing the educational and informative aspects of online engagement, strengthens our case by demonstrating how these platforms enhance public understanding of the legal system, a cornerstone of achieving justice.<br><br>Second, the negative team’s focus on "minimizing harm" as the judging criterion is overly cautious and insufficient for evaluating the complex impact of online public opinion trials.  Maximizing societal benefit, our proposed criterion, is superior because it considers both potential harms and positive contributions to justice.  This holistic approach aligns with the core principles of justice, which seek not just to avoid harm, but also to actively promote fairness and equity.  A study in the Journal of Information Policy [3] highlights how online platforms facilitate civic engagement and can hold power accountable, directly contributing to a more just society.  By focusing solely on minimizing harm, the negative team neglects the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice, thus weakening their argument and strengthening ours.<br><br>Third, the negative team’s claim that online public opinion trials inevitably lead to vigilantism is an unfounded generalization.  While acknowledging potential risks, we argue that vigilantism is not an inherent outcome of online discussions. Many platforms actively moderate content [4], and research suggests that online discussions often center on raising awareness, supporting victims, and advocating for legal reforms [5].  These positive contributions are crucial for achieving justice and are entirely disregarded by the negative team.  Their focus on a potential negative outcome, while ignoring the demonstrable positive impacts, weakens their argument and strengthens our position that online platforms can be powerful tools for positive change.<br><br>Fourth, the negative team's argument that online platforms amplify biases, while true, overlooks their unique capacity to *mitigate* bias by providing diverse perspectives and amplifying marginalized voices. While traditional media can also amplify bias, as discussed in [6], online platforms offer a unique opportunity for counter-speech and the dissemination of alternative viewpoints [7]. This ability to challenge dominant narratives and foster a more inclusive public discourse is crucial for achieving a just society. By focusing solely on the potential for bias amplification, the negative team ignores the unique potential of online platforms to promote balanced and informed public discourse<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1) Cornell Law School.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Friends, judges, and esteemed audience, the affirmative team’s arguments, while superficially appealing, fail to address the fundamental flaws of online public opinion trials. Their attempts to redefine the motion, shift the judging criteria, and downplay the inherent risks only serve to highlight the weakness of their position.<br><br>First, let’s address their broad definition of online public opinion trials. While resources like Cornell Law's Legal Information Institute [1] and Electronic Case Filings websites [2] undoubtedly offer valuable legal information, they are distinct from the often-toxic environment of online public opinion trials.  These trials, as we defined, involve public judgment and condemnation, often based on incomplete information.  This distinction is crucial.  While legal information platforms promote informed citizenry, online trials frequently devolve into biased, emotionally-charged judgments.  This undermines due process, evidenced by online shaming leading to offline harassment ([3], [4]) and the disproportionate impact of cancel culture on marginalized communities ([5], [6]).<br><br>Next, let’s consider their proposed judging criteria of "maximizing societal benefit."  While a laudable goal, it's dangerously incomplete.  Focusing solely on benefits ignores the potential for significant harm. Studies document the spread of misinformation [7] and negative public opinion outbreaks [8] resulting from online trials.  These harms can undermine the very justice the affirmative seeks to promote. A balanced approach, prioritizing minimizing harm, is crucial. Imagine being subjected to a trial by social media, your reputation tarnished before due process, based on misinformation amplified by algorithms. Where is the societal benefit in that?<br><br>The affirmative’s claim that vigilantism isn’t an inherent outcome of online discussions is simply wishful thinking.  While content moderation exists, the very structure of online public opinion trials encourages vigilantism.  Platforms enable rapid dissemination of accusations, fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before due process ( [9]). This often spills into offline harassment and violence, documented in cases where online and offline bullying co-occur ([10], [3]).  While some online discussions might raise awareness, the potential for vigilantism remains significant, fueled by public shaming tactics ( [9]).  Think about how quickly misinformation spreads online, how easily individuals can be targeted and harassed.  This is not justice; it's a dangerous erosion of due process.<br><br>Finally, their argument about mitigating bias ignores the reality of echo chambers.  Prejudiced individuals seek confirming information online ( [11]). Platforms prioritize engagement, allowing biased narratives to proliferate [12].  Individuals are judged based on amplified pre-existing biases [13], hindering impartial justice.  Their claim of diverse perspectives is often drowned out by the cacophony of biased information amplified by algorithms designed for engagement, not truth.<br><br>Furthermore, let's address the critical issue of due process.  Social media's rapid information dissemination leads to premature judgments, impacting due process integrity ( [14]). This instantaneous nature bypasses the structured, evidence-based legal process, creating a "trial by social media" environment ([15]). This undermines the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial ([16]), jeopardizing impartiality.  Consider the potential consequences: your life upended by online accusations before you have a chance to defend yourself in a court of law. This is not justice; this is a dangerous perversion of it.<br><br><br>**Reference**<br><br>[1] Cornell Law School. *Legal Information Institute*. www.law.cornell.edu/lii/<br>[2] Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts. pacer.gov<br>[3]  Hinduja, Sameer, and Justin W.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. In today's debate, our discussion primarily revolved around the impact of online public opinion trials on the pursuit of justice. While our opponents have focused on potential harms, we maintain that these platforms, when understood broadly, bring us closer to justice by maximizing societal benefit.<br><br>Our opponents define online public opinion trials narrowly as mere "judgment and condemnation." However, this ignores the multifaceted nature of online engagement with legal issues.  Online platforms are crucial for sharing information, fostering discussions, and promoting legal education. These activities, which *precede* judgment, empower citizens to form nuanced opinions and contribute to a more informed public discourse. Studies show online discussions can lead to deeper analysis and critical thinking about legal issues [17].  Moreover, online platforms have facilitated positive legal outcomes, such as petitions leading to a $15 million settlement in a civil rights lawsuit [19] and crowdsourced investigations helping identify suspects in criminal cases [10].<br><br>The negative team advocates for "minimizing harm" as the judging criteria.  While harm reduction is important, their narrow focus overlooks the significant potential for online platforms to *increase* justice. Our criterion, "maximizing societal benefit," encompasses both harm reduction and the active promotion of justice.  Increased transparency, a key feature of online discussions, holds legal actors accountable [9] and promotes fairness [8].  Furthermore, online platforms amplify marginalized voices [12], ensuring their concerns are heard and addressed, contributing to a more equitable legal system.<br><br>Our opponents raise valid concerns about due process<br><br>**Reference**<br>(1)  Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. *Manufacturing Consent*.

                        <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Esteemed judges, the core conflict in this debate revolves around the true nature of online public opinion trials: do they enhance or obstruct justice?  We firmly believe they obstruct justice. While the affirmative paints a picture of informed citizenry and amplified voices, they fail to grapple with the inherent dangers we’ve highlighted.<br><br>Our opponents’ broad definition of online public opinion trials ignores the crucial distinction between information sharing and the toxic reality of online judgment and condemnation.  While platforms can educate, online trials often devolve into biased, emotionally-charged arenas.  Their focus on “maximizing societal benefit” as the sole criterion overlooks the demonstrable harms: vigilantism, amplified biases, and the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.  Imagine yourselves subjected to a trial by social media, judged not on facts but on amplified biases, your life upended by accusations before due process.  Where is the justice in that?<br><br>We have shown that online public opinion trials encourage vigilantism, bypassing due process and fostering a mob mentality where individuals are condemned before having a chance to defend themselves.  These trials amplify existing prejudices, creating echo chambers where biased narratives proliferate.  They disproportionately harm marginalized communities, exacerbating existing vulnerabilities.  The affirmative's arguments fail to address these fundamental flaws. Their vision of a more just society through online trials is, at best, naive, and at worst, dangerously misleading.  We urge you to reject this flawed notion and uphold the principles of due process, fairness, and true justice.  A just society is built on the foundations of a fair legal system, not the shifting sands of online opinion.<br><br><br>**Reference**<br><br>[1] Herman, Edward S., and Noam Chomsky. *Manufacturing Consent*.
