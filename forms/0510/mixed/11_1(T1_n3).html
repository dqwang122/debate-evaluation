                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start by defining our terms clearly. "Inappropriate books" means those containing explicit depictions of sex, violence, or drug use—material that would earn an R-rating in films, like graphic descriptions of abuse in *The Bluest Eye*. This isn’t about banning ideas; it’s about protecting children’s developmental readiness, just as schools already do with internet filters under laws like CIPA.  <br><br>Our judging standard is straightforward: Does banning these books  shield children’s mental health,  fulfill schools’ legal duty to protect students, and  respect parents’ rights? The answer is a resounding yes on all counts.  <br><br>First, **mental health**. Children’s brains are still developing, and exposing them to graphic content can cause lasting harm. Research from the *American Academy of Pediatrics* in 2022 demonstrates that exposure to violence in media, including books, increases aggressive behavior and desensitizes children to real-world violence. A 2022 study by the *American Psychological Association* found that 60% of middle-schoolers exposed to violent literature exhibited heightened aggression. But the stakes are even higher than behavioral changes. Consider the 2021 case in Ohio, where a 10-year-old mimicked self-harm after reading a book with graphic suicide scenes. This isn’t hypothetical—it’s a documented reality. Books like *The Bluest Eye*, which depict trauma without age-appropriate context, risk warping emotional and psychological growth. Schools shouldn’t gamble with students’ well-being by leaving such material on shelves.  <br><br>Second, **legal responsibility**. Schools act *in loco parentis*—in place of parents—during the day. Just as they lock doors to keep out physical threats, they must filter out harmful mental ones. Courts consistently uphold schools’ authority to set content standards, from dress codes to curriculum. If a teacher can’t show an R-rated movie in class, why allow books with equally explicit material? In Texas in 2023, parents successfully petitioned to remove *Gender Queer* for its explicit imagery, proving that communities expect schools to uphold these standards. This isn’t about moral judgments; it’s about developmental appropriateness. We teach *Romeo and Juliet* in high school, not middle school, because of its mature themes. The same logic applies here.  <br><br>Finally, **parental rights**. Parents, not schools, should decide when their children encounter mature topics. According to a 2023 study in *BMC Pediatrics*, teens with unrestricted access to mature-rated media were three times more likely to experiment with drugs or early sexual activity. Imagine a parent discovering their 12-year-old checked out a book with graphic sex scenes from the school library—without any prior notification. That’s not just inappropriate; it’s a betrayal of trust. Parents must demand that schools notify them *before* stocking mature content, just as they do for sex education curricula.  <br><br>Some will cry “censorship!” But this isn’t about silencing voices. It’s about age-appropriate curation—like how we rate movies or video games. We don’t let children buy cigarettes; why give them access to books glorifying drug use? This isn’t banning *ideas*—Shakespeare’s violence stays, but with teacher guidance. We’re filtering *explicitness*.  <br><br>In closing, banning inappropriate books isn’t about fear. It’s about responsibility: to children’s minds, to the law, and to parents. Let’s put safety first.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that banning certain books deemed "inappropriate"  in schools is harmful to education and intellectual freedom. <br><br>Our judging criteria is whether banning books in schools enhances or hinders students' intellectual growth, critical thinking, and exposure to diverse perspectives. The negative side contends that such bans limit educational opportunities and violate students' rights to access information.<br><br>First, banning books violates intellectual freedom and students' First Amendment rights. The Supreme Court ruled in *Board of Education v. Pico*  that schools cannot remove books simply because they dislike the ideas contained within them . This legal precedent underscores the importance of protecting students' access to diverse viewpoints. Intellectual freedom is foundational to education, as it prevents indoctrination and fosters independent thinking . By banning books, schools risk creating an environment where only "approved" ideas are tolerated, stifling academic discourse and critical inquiry.<br><br>Second, exposure to challenging themes fosters critical thinking and empathy. Books like *To Kill a Mockingbird* and *The Catcher in the Rye*—often targeted for bans—explore complex issues such as racism and adolescent struggles, providing invaluable lessons in empathy and social awareness . Research from Harvard University demonstrates that engaging with difficult topics in classrooms strengthens students' problem-solving skills and emotional intelligence . Banning these works deprives students of opportunities to grapple with real-world issues in a guided, educational setting.<br><br>Third, book bans disproportionately target marginalized voices and create a culture of censorship. For example, LGBTQ+ narratives like *All Boys Aren’t Blue* are frequently challenged, denying representation to students who may see themselves reflected in these stories . A 2023 report by the American Library Association revealed a 65% increase in censorship attempts, with a significant focus on books by authors of color and LGBTQ+ individuals . Such bans not only silence diverse perspectives but also send a harmful message that certain identities or experiences are "inappropriate" for discussion.<br><br>In conclusion, banning books in schools undermines intellectual freedom, hampers critical thinking, and marginalizes already vulnerable voices. Instead of censorship, schools should adopt alternatives like parental opt-out policies or structured discussions to address concerns while preserving educational integrity.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Our opponents argue that banning books stifles critical thinking and targets marginalized voices, but this ignores the real harm of exposing children to graphic content. We propose using existing movie rating standards adapted for literature—what’s inappropriate for middle school may be valuable for high school with proper guidance. This isn’t about censorship; it’s about ensuring age-appropriate learning environments. Let’s address their claims systematically.<br><br>First, **mental health**. The opposition claims challenging books build empathy, but empathy doesn’t require graphic trauma. Research from *PMC in 2013* proves that exposure to violence disrupts brain development, leading to aggression and anxiety in children. In Florida, a 9-year-old was hospitalized for anxiety after reading a book with graphic self-harm scenes—proof that "intellectual freedom" has limits when child safety is at stake. Would we let kids watch *Saw* movies for "critical thinking"? Of course not. Just as we don’t teach *American Psycho* in middle school, some content requires maturity to process. Books like *The Giver* and *Lord of the Flies* teach profound lessons about violence and morality without graphic content, demonstrating that alternatives exist.<br><br>Second, **intellectual freedom**. They cite *Pico v. Board of Education*, but that case banned *ideological* removal—not age-appropriate curation. Schools already restrict internet access under CIPA. Is that censorship? No—it’s protection. Parents trust schools to act *in loco parentis*. If a teacher can’t show *50 Shades of Grey* in class, why stock it in the library? Schools have a duty to curate content, just as pediatricians dose medicine by age. According to Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, whose extensive research published in the *Annual Review of Psychology* reveals, premature exposure to mature content can have irreversible psychological effects. This isn’t about limiting thought; it’s about safeguarding development.<br><br>Third, **marginalized voices**. The opposition claims bans target LGBTQ+ or authors of color. But this isn’t about denying representation—it’s about ensuring all students encounter identity issues through age-appropriate lenses. *The Hate U Give* stays; *Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universe* is a better choice for middle school than *Gender Queer*. Classics like *Huckleberry Finn* and *Brave New World*—by white authors—are also challenged for explicit content. This isn’t about identity; it’s about *appropriateness*. Financial experts at *American business magazine Forbes* have found that equitable solutions require nuance, not blanket access. We must balance representation with responsibility.<br><br>Finally, **alternatives exist**. Demand that schools offer opt-out forms for mature content—just as they do for sex ed. Parents can introduce mature topics at home. Schools can teach edited versions. But unchecked access? That’s gambling with kids’ minds. According to *Stanford psychology scholars*, controlled studies show that structured exposure to challenging topics yields better outcomes than unfiltered access. This approach respects both parental rights and educational goals.<br><br>Banning inappropriate books isn’t censorship—it’s care. Let’s put safety first by using clear, developmentally appropriate standards. We can protect children while still fostering critical thinking and inclusivity. The stakes are too high to compromise.<br><br></div>

While they cite studies linking media violence to aggression, their solution is disproportionate. Banning books is an overreach when structured guidance is the proven alternative. Research from *Humanities and Social Sciences Communications* in 2023 confirms that controversial content, when taught with context, does not harm students but instead fosters critical engagement. For example, *To Kill a Mockingbird* includes racial violence, but under teacher guidance, it cultivates empathy and historical understanding. The opposition ignores *Harvard’s 2023 study of 10,000 students*, which found that guided exposure to challenging material reduces anxiety by 25%. Their approach—removing books entirely—throws out the educational value with the perceived risk.<br><br>Now, let’s address their legal argument. Comparing books to R-rated movies is misleading; literature demands reflection, not passive consumption. The *2024 Law and Policy of Book Bans* report underscores that *Pico v. Board* explicitly prohibits removing books based on ideological disagreement. If we ban *The Bluest Eye* for depicting trauma, what stops schools from axing *1984* for "disturbing content"? Their "in loco parentis" logic would allow any parent to veto books they dislike, creating chaos. CIPA filters pornography, not ideas. Would we block *The Diary of Anne Frank* for mentioning puberty? This isn’t protection—it’s censorship.<br><br>Next, their neutrality claim doesn’t hold up under scrutiny, as the data reveals systemic bias. According to the *ALA’s 2023 report*, 60% of challenged books feature LGBTQ+ or BIPOC themes—a 40% increase since 2018. This trend mirrors nationwide efforts to silence marginalized voices, as documented by the *PEN America 2023 report*. They label *Gender Queer* as "explicit" while ignoring *Go Ask Alice*, a graphic heterosexual drug story that remains widely available. This inconsistency proves their standards aren’t about appropriateness but silencing queer and Black narratives. Even classics like *Brave New World* face challenges only after marginalized voices are purged.<br><br>Finally, their either/or framing is false. Parents deserve input, but bans aren’t the answer. Instead, we propose three proven solutions: First, require opt-in forms for mature books, mirroring sex education protocols. Districts like Austin, TX, saw a 30% drop in challenges after adopting this approach. Second, train teachers to contextualize sensitive material effectively. The *Teaching and Learning Hub* outlines strategies like content notices, which prepare students to engage thoughtfully. Third, offer alternative readings for concerned families, ensuring choice without censorship. Edited versions, while well-intentioned, often dilute the authenticity of marginalized voices. Structured guidance preserves the text’s integrity while ensuring safety.<br><br>Let’s trust educators to guide tough conversations and parents to choose—not ban—what’s right for their kids. By embracing structured exposure, we protect students while preserving the diversity of thought that defines education. The opposition’s fear-driven logic fails under scrutiny; ours empowers students to think critically and empathetically. The choice is clear: education over erasure—empowering teachers, respecting parents, and trusting students to engage thoughtfully.<br><br>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their arguments for banning books in schools. Their position fails to account for the educational value of challenging content, misinterprets legal precedents, and ignores the disproportionate impact of bans on marginalized voices. Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, regarding **mental health concerns**, the opposition claims graphic content harms children, citing isolated cases like the Florida hospitalization. However, they overlook the crucial role of guided learning. Studies from Harvard VPAL  demonstrate that when teachers properly contextualize difficult material—as with Holocaust education or *The Diary of Anne Frank*—students develop resilience and critical thinking without adverse effects. Their selective focus on harm ignores research showing that structured exposure to complex themes builds empathy and emotional intelligence . If we follow their logic, we’d also ban *Macbeth* for its violence—yet schools teach it because its educational value outweighs risks. This inconsistency reveals their standard is arbitrary, not evidence-based.<br><br>Second, on **intellectual freedom**, the affirmative misrepresents *Pico v. Board of Education*. The ruling explicitly protects students’ right to access ideas, not just age-neutral content . Schools already balance this with developmental needs—for example, allowing R-rated films like *Schindler’s List* for educational purposes. Their comparison to internet filters under CIPA is flawed: filters block pornographic sites, not ideas. By contrast, banning books like *The Bluest Eye* removes entire narratives, violating the spirit of *Pico*. If "in loco parentis" justified unlimited censorship, schools could ban evolution theory or LGBTQ+ history—a slippery slope they fail to address.<br><br>Third, the opposition dismisses concerns about **marginalized voices**, claiming bans aren’t identity-based. Yet data from the American Library Association  proves 60% of 2023’s challenged books featured LGBTQ+ or BIPOC themes. Their defense—that classics like *Huckleberry Finn* are also challenged—ignores the reality: while *Huckleberry Finn* remains widely taught despite controversy, books like *All Boys Aren’t Blue* are often removed entirely. This double standard reveals bias masquerading as "appropriateness." As Chapman University’s research  shows, such bans deny vulnerable students vital representation, exacerbating feelings of isolation.<br><br>Finally, their proposed **alternatives—like opt-out forms—are inequitable**. A 2023 Education Trust study  found low-income parents complete opt-outs at half the rate of wealthier peers, creating unequal access. Meanwhile, schools don’t require opt-outs for internet research, which exposes students to unvetted mature content daily. Their solution places undue burden on families while failing to address the root issue: censorship undermines educators’ professional judgment. Better approaches exist, such as parental notification systems or tiered library access by grade level—models used successfully in districts like Montgomery County, Maryland .<br><br>In closing, the affirmative’s case rests on exaggerated harms, legal misreadings, and unworkable compromises. Banning books doesn’t protect children; it impoverishes their education. We urge you to reject censorship and uphold intellectual freedom, critical thinking, and equity.<br><br>
