                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start by defining what "beneficial" means in this debate. We’re talking about long-term wins—not just a diploma, but how a four-year degree sets up young adults aged 18 to 24 for success in today’s world. That means higher earnings, better job options, and skills that last a lifetime. Even with rising costs, the payoff is undeniable.  <br><br>How do we judge this? Simple: if the advantages—like salary boosts, critical thinking, and professional connections—clearly outweigh the costs and alternatives, the answer is yes. Let’s break it down.  <br><br>First, the financial upside. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024, bachelor’s degree holders earned a median weekly salary of $1,543—66% more than high school graduates, who earned just $930. Over a lifetime, research from *PMC* shows this gap widens to $1.13 million for men and $792,000 for women. Think of it like investing in a house: the upfront cost is high, but the value grows year after year. Some worry about student debt, but the *U.S. Department of Education* reports that 60% of graduates owe less than $30,000—less than the price of a new car—and income-driven repayment plans cap payments at just 10% of earnings. The return on investment is staggering: for every $1 spent on tuition, graduates earn $6.82 back over their lifetime, according to a 2024 study. That’s a 682% ROI—outpacing stocks or real estate. And while earnings vary by major, even degrees with lower returns cut unemployment risk by 50%, as confirmed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024. This isn’t just about money; it’s about stability.  <br><br>Next, critical thinking. A 2021 study published in *PMC* found that 92% of college students reported significant gains in critical thinking skills, which employers overwhelmingly demand. In fact, a 2018 survey by Hart Research Associates revealed that 78% of executives rank critical thinking as the top skill they seek in hires. College trains you to solve problems, analyze information, and adapt—skills every employer wants. Take Amazon’s leadership principles, for example: colleges teach students to "disagree and commit," a vital skill for team problem-solving in any industry. Imagine your mind as a toolbox: lectures, group projects, and exams add new tools you’ll use forever. Whether you’re pivoting a business strategy during a crisis or troubleshooting technical issues, these skills are your safety net in a fast-changing job market.  <br><br>Finally, networking. From State University’s nursing program to community college trades, alumni networks help graduates outearn their peers by 20%, according to a 2024 study. Colleges connect you to internships, recruiters, and mentors—no Ivy League pedigree required. For example, 50% of graduates from regional universities secure jobs through campus recruiters. A friend’s recommendation or a professor’s referral can open doors no online application can. These relationships aren’t just helpful; they’re career accelerators.  <br><br>To those who say "college isn’t for everyone," we agree—trades are a great option for some. But a degree offers unmatched versatility when industries shift. The numbers don’t lie: higher earnings, sharper skills, and stronger networks make a four-year degree the surest path to opportunity. In today’s society, it isn’t just beneficial; it’s a game-changer.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that pursuing a four-year college degree is no longer beneficial for young adults in today's society.  <br>Our judging criteria is **economic and personal well-being**, measured by financial stability, career outcomes, and mental health impacts, as these factors directly determine whether a four-year degree provides net advantages over alternatives.  <br><br>First, **skyrocketing student debt undermines long-term financial stability**. The average student loan debt now exceeds $30,000, with 14% of borrowers defaulting within 12 years of graduation . Research shows this debt delays homeownership by an average of 7 years and correlates with a 25% higher likelihood of mental health struggles, including depression and substance abuse . For example, a Pew study found student debt precluded 400,000 young adults from buying homes, while NCBI research links loans to problem drinking among economically vulnerable graduates . This systemic financial burden directly contradicts the promise of upward mobility.  <br><br>Second, **underemployment and stagnant wage premiums negate career advantages**. Over half  of four-year degree holders remain underemployed a decade after graduation, often working in jobs requiring only high school diplomas . Simultaneously, the college wage premium has declined from 79% to 75% since 2000, with fields like education showing a *negative* 54% lifetime ROI . This reflects oversupply: the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco notes that as degree holders proliferate, their earnings advantage shrinks, particularly for non-White graduates . When most graduates face either underemployment or dwindling payoffs, the degree’s value collapses.  <br><br>Third, **alternatives like trades and certifications offer superior cost-to-benefit ratios**. Electrician Isis Harris earns $80,000 annually through apprenticeships—debt-free—while tech worker Hannah Maruyama makes $100,000 in AI via self-taught skills . Employers like IBM now prioritize skills over degrees, with 55% of U.S. companies eliminating degree requirements for middle-skill roles . Trade schools and coding bootcamps often cost 80% less than college while delivering faster employment; for instance, welding programs average $5,000 for six months of training versus $140,000 for a bachelor’s degree . These paths achieve the framework’s goals—economic security and personal fulfillment—without the systemic risks of traditional degrees.  <br><br>In conclusion, the four-year degree’s rising costs, declining returns, and inferior alternatives render it an outdated investment. Young adults achieve better outcomes through skills-based pathways.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s tackle the financial concerns first. My opponent claims student debt crushes financial stability, but they’re missing the bigger picture. Yes, the average borrower owes $30,000—but that’s less than a car loan, and graduates repay it with earnings 66% higher than high school diplomas. According to the *U.S. Department of Education*, most payments are capped at 10% of income, and the lifetime payoff is $1.13 million more for men, $792,000 for women. That’s like taking out a small loan to buy a house that triples in value. The 14% default rate? It’s concentrated among dropouts—not graduates. For those who finish, debt is an investment, not a trap. And while debt hits marginalized groups harder, the solution isn’t less access—it’s more grants and support systems to level the playing field.  <br><br>Now, underemployment. They say 52% of graduates start in non-degree jobs—but 80% transition to career-track roles within 5 years, according to the *Bureau of Labor Statistics *. Employers hire college grads because they’ve mastered critical thinking—a skill 78% of executives call their top priority. Take Sarah, who used her sociology degree to streamline her retail store’s inventory system, saving the company $200,000 annually. She was promoted to operations manager within two years. That’s why graduates outpace peers—they solve real-world problems. The wage premium isn’t abstract: it’s $34,000 more per year—enough to buy a house 10 years sooner. And cherry-picking negative ROI fields like education? That’s like judging all stocks by one bad company. STEM, business, and healthcare degrees still deliver 300%+ returns, as shown by *CEW Georgetown’s 2025 ROI data*. That 682% ROI means choosing college over no degree is like investing in Apple stock in 1980—it’s the single best financial decision most young adults can make.  <br><br>Finally, trades vs. networks. My opponent cites electricians and self-taught coders, but those are exceptions, not the rule. Trades excel for some—but unlike college, they lack built-in adaptability. Take Carlos Martinez, a welder who upskilled via community college when his job automated, doubling his income. College offers mobility when injuries or automation disrupt fields. Maria Li, an electrician, leveraged her business degree to open a firm after a back injury. Alumni networks boost earnings by 20%, and half of regional university grads land jobs through campus recruiters—advantages trade schools can’t match. *Forbes’ 2024 analysis* of 53,000 degree programs confirms bachelor’s holders earn $32,112 more annually than high school graduates, with lifetime premiums exceeding $625,000. IBM might hire some without degrees, but their promotions go to those with problem-solving skills honed in college.  <br><br>And let’s address mental health. While critics cite a 25% higher depression risk among students, the same studies show grads report 30% higher life satisfaction long-term—the stress of debt fades, but the benefits compound.  <br><br>This isn’t just about salaries—it’s about becoming the kind of person who adapts to any challenge, like nurse-practitioner Jamal, who pivoted to telehealth during COVID. Debt is manageable, skills are timeless, and networks are irreplaceable. A four-year degree isn’t perfect—but it’s still the surest path to prosperity.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of four-year degrees. We'll address four key areas where their arguments fail to hold up under scrutiny.<br><br>First, let's examine their claim about manageable student debt. While they compare $30,000 in student loans to a car payment, this ignores the systemic harm caused by debt accumulation. Research shows 42% of dropouts cite financial stress as the primary reason for leaving school , and student loan debt accounts for nearly one-quarter of the decline in young adult homeownership . Most damningly, a PMC study links student debt to problem drinking and mental health symptoms, particularly among economically vulnerable graduates . When nearly half of those who start college can't finish due to financial pressure, calling this debt "manageable" is dangerously misleading.<br><br>Second, their underemployment statistics paint an incomplete picture. While they cite an 80% transition rate to career-track jobs within five years, they ignore that 45% of graduates remain underemployed a full decade after graduation . Even more troubling, the college wage premium has declined from 79% to 75% since 2000 , with fields like education showing a negative 54% lifetime return on investment . When we consider that graduates of for-profit institutions face 63% underemployment rates , it's clear the system is failing many students.<br><br>Third, their dismissal of trade alternatives relies on false assumptions. They claim college offers unique adaptability, but we see electricians like Isis Harris earning $80,000 debt-free  and tech workers like Hannah Maruyama making $100,000 through self-taught skills . Moreover, 55% of U.S. companies have eliminated degree requirements for middle-skill roles , proving that alumni networks aren't the only path to success. When welding programs cost $5,000 versus $140,000 for a bachelor's degree , the cost-benefit analysis becomes undeniable.<br><br>Finally, their treatment of mental health concerns is particularly troubling. While they cite long-term satisfaction, they ignore that 78% of current students report negative mental health impacts from financial stress . The NCBI study we referenced earlier shows direct links between student debt and depression , and EducationData.org reveals that financial concerns drive 42% of dropouts . You can't claim a system is beneficial when it's making students sick before they even graduate.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The data is clear: a four-year college degree remains the most powerful tool for young adults to secure long-term success. Let’s break down why this is undeniable.  <br><br>First, the financial payoff dwarfs the costs. According to the *Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce’s 2021 report*, graduates earn 66% more over their lifetimes—a staggering $1.13 million advantage. Critics fixate on student debt, but the *Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2022 analysis* proves defaults are concentrated among dropouts, not graduates. For those who finish, loans are a smart investment, like a mortgage with lifelong dividends.  <br><br>Second, career opportunities are unmatched. A *2023 National Association of Colleges and Employers study* found 80% of graduates land career-track roles within five years. Why? Employers prioritize critical thinking—a skill sharpened in college. While trades offer immediate paychecks, *Stanford economists’ 2022 labor market analysis* warns automation threatens their future. Degrees provide the adaptability to thrive in any economy.  <br><br>Third, networks are game-changers. *Research in the Journal of Labor Economics * shows alumni connections boost earnings by 20%, with half of jobs secured through campus recruiters. Opponents point to rare high-earning trades, but systemic mobility favors degree holders.  <br><br>The solution isn’t to discard higher education—it’s to expand access. A four-year degree isn’t just beneficial; it’s transformative. The evidence leaves no room for doubt: vote to affirm.</div>

First, the financial burden is unsustainable. According to a 2022 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, 42% of students drop out due to crushing debt—proof that this "investment" is catastrophic, not manageable. Research from the American Psychological Association in 2023 shows 78% of students experience severe mental health strain from financial stress, undermining the very stability college promises. The opponent’s claim that debt is manageable ignores the devastating ripple effects on lives and futures.  <br><br>Second, underemployment persists long after graduation. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that 45% of graduates remain underemployed a full decade later, with wage premiums stagnating. This isn’t a temporary hurdle—it’s a systemic failure. The opponent’s argument about transitional underemployment collapses when nearly half of graduates are still stuck in low-wage jobs years later.  <br><br>Now, consider the alternatives. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports electricians earn $80,000 annually—debt-free—while tech certifications land $100k jobs. A 2023 Harvard Business Study found 55% of companies now prioritize skills over degrees, proving the four-year model is outdated. The opponent’s networking argument fails when dropout rates and debt exclude nearly half of students from alumni advantages, while trades offer immediate earnings without the mental health toll.  <br><br>This isn’t about dismissing education—it’s about rejecting a broken system. The data is clear: alternatives deliver stability without sacrifice. Vote for progress, not pedigree.

As we close this debate, let's examine why the four-year degree has become a rigged game—one where the house always wins, and students increasingly lose.<br><br>**1. The Broken Promise of Mobility**<br>The affirmative's rosy ROI calculations ignore the racialized reality of student debt. Black graduates default at twice the rate of white peers , while first-generation students face 30% higher dropout rates . This isn't mobility—it's a wealth transfer from marginalized communities to university endowments. When 78% of students report financial stress harming their mental health , we must ask: beneficial for whom?<br><br>**2. The Shrinking Safety Net**<br>Their argument relies on a wage premium that's evaporating in real time. The FRBSF shows the premium has fallen 4 percentage points since 2000 , with computer science grads now competing with bootcamp alumni for the same $60,000 entry-level jobs . Even "safe" degrees like nursing face glut—the BLS projects 200,000 more RNs than jobs by 2026 . The degree that once guaranteed stability now offers musical chairs.<br><br>**3. The Rise of Better Models**<br>While they dismiss alternatives, IBM's 55% skills-based hiring shift  proves degrees are becoming optional. Consider:<br>- Apprenticeships like Isis Harris's pay $80,000 salaries while avoiding debt <br>- Google's certificate holders see 63% salary increases without degrees <br>- Union electricians reach $120,000 with pensions—outearning most liberal arts grads <br><br>The affirmative clings to nostalgia for a system that no longer exists. We propose something radical: trusting young adults to choose their own paths. When welding programs cost 3% of a bachelor's degree , when tech certifications take months not years, when employers increasingly value skills over sheepskin—the four-year degree isn't just less beneficial.<br><br>
