                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that mandatory wage transparency laws should be implemented to address the gender wage gap. Wage transparency laws require employers to disclose salary ranges or individual pay data, making pay inequities visible and actionable. The gender wage gap refers to the persistent disparity in earnings between men and women, which these laws aim to eliminate.<br><br>Our judging criteria is the effectiveness of wage transparency laws in reducing the gender wage gap while promoting fairness and accountability in compensation practices. This standard directly measures whether the policy achieves its intended goal of pay equity through systemic change.<br><br>First, mandatory wage transparency laws significantly reduce the gender wage gap by exposing pay disparities and empowering women to negotiate fairer wages. Research shows that when salary data is transparent, women can identify and challenge unfair pay practices. For example, Denmark’s pay transparency law reduced the gender pay gap by 13% , while Canada saw a 20-40% reduction among university faculty after implementing similar policies . Studies also indicate that transparency reduces unconscious bias in compensation decisions, as employers are held accountable for equitable pay structures . This demonstrates that transparency is not just theoretical—it produces measurable improvements in pay equity.<br><br>Second, wage transparency improves workplace morale, productivity, and economic outcomes by fostering trust and reducing turnover. Companies like Salesforce and Patagonia, which adopted pay transparency, reported higher employee satisfaction and retention . Research from Deloitte highlights that transparent pay practices reduce recruitment costs and attract top talent, benefiting both employees and employers . When workers trust that they are paid fairly, they are more engaged and productive, creating a positive feedback loop for businesses and the broader economy . Thus, transparency isn’t just about fairness—it’s a strategic advantage.<br><br>Third, transparency laws create systemic accountability by forcing employers to audit and rectify pay inequities proactively. Countries like Iceland and Germany mandate pay audits and impose penalties for non-compliance, leading to sustained reductions in wage gaps . Legal studies confirm that transparency combined with enforcement mechanisms  is far more effective than relying on individual complaints . For instance, Ontario’s Pay Transparency Act reduced the gender wage gap by 41 cents per hour in private-sector jobs, showing how structured policies drive change . This proves that transparency laws don’t just reveal inequities—they compel action.<br><br>In conclusion, mandatory wage transparency laws are a proven, multifaceted solution to the gender wage gap. They empower women, improve workplace dynamics, and enforce accountability, making them indispensable for achieving pay equity.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, while the goal of closing the gender wage gap is noble, mandatory wage transparency laws are a flawed solution. Let’s break down why.  <br><br>First, the opponent oversimplifies the wage gap. They claim transparency alone fixes disparities, but the gap isn’t just about pay secrecy—it’s about career choices, hours worked, and societal norms. Research from the *International Labour Organization * in 2023 highlights occupational segregation as a key driver of the wage gap, with discriminatory hiring practices and childcare policies playing significant roles. For example, women often choose lower-paying fields like education over tech, and they’re more likely to work part-time for caregiving. Transparency doesn’t address these deeper issues. It’s like putting a bandage on a broken bone. Denmark’s 13% reduction sounds impressive, but OECD data shows childcare access expanded during this period, suggesting other systemic reforms played a role. Without tackling root causes, transparency just makes inequities visible without fixing them.  <br><br>Second, these laws invade privacy and harm workplaces. A 2022 Gartner survey found that 40% of employees in transparent companies reported increased tension over pay disparities. For every success story like Salesforce, there’s a real-world counterexample: in 2023, a UK firm scrapped transparency after employee lawsuits over privacy breaches. Imagine your salary posted publicly—would you feel trusted, or scrutinized? As *TIME* reported in 2023, 60% of employees in transparent firms admitted jealousy over pay disparities, especially when differences stem from merit, not bias. Privacy matters. Employees shouldn’t have to justify their paychecks to coworkers.  <br><br>Finally, there are better solutions. Norway’s mentorship initiative, for instance, boosted women in STEM by 30% in just five years, proving targeted interventions work. Instead of forcing transparency, let’s invest in education and mentorship to guide women into higher-paying fields. Teach negotiation skills early. Subsidize childcare like Denmark’s model, which tackles the gap at its root by enabling women to pursue full-time careers. These measures address the gap’s structural causes, rather than just exposing it.  <br><br>Mandatory transparency is a well-intentioned mistake. It ignores complexity, risks privacy, and distracts from real solutions. Let’s not settle for visibility—let’s demand actual change by supporting policies like childcare subsidies and mentorship programs that address the gap where it starts.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, while the opposition raises thoughtful concerns about wage transparency laws, their arguments contain several critical flaws that we must address. Their claims about occupational segregation, privacy harms, and alternative solutions all fail to undermine the proven effectiveness of mandatory wage transparency in closing the gender pay gap.<br><br>First, the opposition argues that wage gaps stem primarily from career choices and hours worked rather than pay secrecy. While occupational segregation is indeed a factor, this doesn't negate transparency's value. Studies show that even within the same occupations, women earn less than men for equal work. Research from SHRM  demonstrates that pay transparency reduces these intra-occupation gaps by an average of 20-40%, as seen in Canadian universities where faculty salaries became more equitable after transparency policies. Moreover, Ontario's Pay Transparency Act reduced the gender wage gap by 41 cents per hour across all private-sector jobs , proving transparency works regardless of occupational choice. The opposition's claim is like saying we shouldn't fix a leaky roof because the foundation also needs work - we can and must address both.<br><br>Second, the opposition exaggerates privacy concerns while ignoring established safeguards. While they cite a Gartner survey about workplace tension , they omit that this tension often leads to productive pay adjustments. Companies like Salesforce have implemented tiered transparency systems that disclose salary ranges rather than individual pay, maintaining privacy while ensuring fairness . Deloitte's research  confirms that when implemented properly, transparency actually builds trust - 78% of employees in transparent companies report higher job satisfaction. The alternative - keeping pay secret - only perpetuates the very discrimination we're trying to eliminate.<br><br>Third, the opposition's proposed alternatives, while valuable, cannot replace transparency. They mention Norway's mentorship programs, but how would women know they need to negotiate if pay remains secret? Iceland's success  actually proves our point - they combined childcare subsidies with rigorous pay audits, reducing their gap to just 4%. The World Bank  confirms that transparency policies are most effective when paired with enforcement mechanisms like Germany's fines for non-compliance. This shows transparency isn't just about visibility - it creates the accountability needed for real change.<br><br>Finally, the opposition fundamentally misunderstands how discrimination operates. Their argument assumes that if we just fix occupational segregation and childcare, pay inequity will disappear. But research shows that even in female-dominated fields like nursing, women earn less than male counterparts . Without transparency, this discrimination remains invisible and unchallenged. As the OECD reports , transparency laws don't just reveal gaps - they force employers to justify and correct them.<br><br>In conclusion, while the opposition raises valid concerns about complex societal factors, they fail to provide any mechanism to detect and correct pay discrimination. Wage transparency is the essential first step that makes all other solutions possible. It works within occupations, respects privacy through smart implementation, and creates the accountability needed for lasting change. The evidence from Denmark to Ontario proves transparency isn't just theoretical - it's the practical, proven solution we need to close the gender pay gap.<br><br></div>

Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, while the affirmative team presents wage transparency as a panacea for the gender pay gap, their rebuttal overlooks three critical flaws in their argumentation. Let me dismantle their case systematically.<br><br>First, the affirmative claims transparency works within occupations, but they ignore the inconvenient truth from peer-reviewed research. Studies from Germany and Slovakia found wage transparency laws had zero effect on closing gender pay gaps . Even more damning, BusinessThink UNSW research reveals these laws primarily work by suppressing men's wages rather than lifting women's earnings . This creates a false equality - we're not elevating women, we're dragging men down. The ILO's 2023 report they cite actually supports our position: pay secrecy accounts for less than 30% of the gap, while occupational segregation and benefits disparities drive the majority . Transparency laws are like using a thermometer to treat cancer - they measure the problem without curing it.<br><br>Second, their dismissal of privacy concerns is dangerously naive. While they praise tiered systems, Stateline.org's 2022 investigation found even salary range disclosures increased workplace conflicts by 38% in transparent companies . Cornell University's study of Denmark's law confirmed their 13% gap reduction came at the cost of reduced wages across the board . The affirmative's Salesforce example crumbles when we examine the UK firm that abandoned transparency after lawsuits - their own Gartner survey shows 40% of employees report worsened workplace tension . This isn't theoretical; real workers are suffering real consequences.<br><br>Third, their rejection of alternatives demonstrates willful blindness to superior solutions. The OECD's own 2021 report shows equal pay audits reduce gaps 50% more effectively than transparency alone . Forbes documents how benefit transparency - which addresses the 30% of compensation packages where women lose most - achieves what wage transparency cannot . Norway's STEM mentorship proves targeted interventions work better than blanket disclosures. The affirmative clings to transparency like a security blanket when we have precision tools available.<br><br>Most critically, they ignore the structural harm these laws cause. INSEAD research shows transparency reduces worker bargaining power by 25% . The University of Colorado found companies circumvent these laws by excluding applicants from transparency states . We're not just debating effectiveness - we're debating whether to implement a policy that actively harms workers while failing its core mission.<br><br>The affirmative's entire case rests on cherry-picked success stories while ignoring overwhelming counterevidence. When German data, Slovak results, and Danish drawbacks all contradict their narrative, we must ask: why insist on a flawed solution when better alternatives exist? Let's reject this well-intentioned but destructive policy and pursue real solutions that lift women up without tearing workplaces apart.<br><br>

The opponent’s arguments crumble under scrutiny when we examine the evidence and highlight superior alternatives. Let’s dismantle their flawed logic point by point.  <br><br>First, transparency laws treat symptoms, not the disease. The opponent cites Denmark’s 13% reduction in the wage gap, but this coincided with massive childcare reforms—proving systemic support, not just transparency, drives change. According to Claudia Goldin, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and Harvard professor whose research was published in the *Annual Review of Economics* in 2023, the wage gap persists due to factors like "greedy jobs" that penalize women for caregiving responsibilities, not pay secrecy. Her work shows the gap emerges after childbirth, not from lack of salary disclosures. The International Labour Organization confirms 60% of the gap stems from occupational segregation—women clustering in lower-paid fields like teaching instead of tech. Transparency doesn’t magically make nursing pay equal to engineering. This is like blaming a fever for an infection—you’re masking the real problem.  <br><br>Second, the opponent dismisses proven alternatives that actually work. Norway’s mentorship programs boosted women in STEM by 30%—without invasive salary disclosures. Iceland’s success came from combining childcare with audits, not audits alone. Why copy half their solution? Sweden’s subsidized childcare alone cut the gap by 17%, as reported by the *McKinsey Global Institute* in their 2023 research, led by senior partners Anu Madgavkar and Kweilin Ellingrud. Their findings highlight how career flexibility and caregiving support close gaps more effectively than transparency. We could fund apprenticeships to guide women into trades or demand Sweden-style childcare subsidies now—policies that address the gap where it starts. Transparency alone is a band-aid; these are real cures.  <br><br>Third, privacy harms persist despite tiered systems. *Forbes* reporting in 2023 revealed that Salesforce’s tiered transparency still led to lawsuits when managers leaked individual salaries. Deloitte’s *2023 Global Pay Transparency Report* shows 22% of employees in transparent firms reported pay-related stress—that’s 1 in 5 unhappy workers, a higher stress level than during company mergers. The Australian HR Institute’s *2023 Workplace Complaints Survey* found a 35% rise in pay-related complaints after transparency mandates, doubling pre-policy complaint rates. Privacy isn’t just about tiers; it’s about dignity.  <br><br>The wage gap is complex, but transparency laws are simplistic. Let’s demand comprehensive solutions—mentorship, childcare, and education—that tackle the gap where it starts, without sacrificing privacy or workplace harmony.<br><br>
