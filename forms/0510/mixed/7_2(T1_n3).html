                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should be shared equally between partners. We define "dating expenses" as costs incurred during courtship activities, such as meals, entertainment, transportation, and gifts. "Shared equally" means a fair distribution where both partners contribute proportionally or alternately to these expenses, ensuring neither bears an undue financial burden.<br><br>Our judging criteria is whether equal sharing of dating expenses promotes fairness, reduces financial stress, and enhances relationship satisfaction. This standard is appropriate because it aligns with modern values of gender equality and financial partnership in relationships. <br><br>First, equal sharing of dating expenses promotes financial equity and reduces resentment. Studies show that couples who split costs equally report higher relationship satisfaction, with 75% of Gen Z and millennials believing dating costs should be shared . This prevents one partner from feeling exploited, as financial fairness eliminates power imbalances. For example, research indicates that participants who pooled finances reported 23% higher satisfaction than those who didn't . By distributing costs fairly, couples foster mutual respect—a cornerstone of healthy relationships.<br><br>Second, equal expense sharing aligns with modern gender equality norms. Feminist economic theory emphasizes that financial parity challenges outdated provider-dependent dynamics . Surveys reveal that wealthier daters are 40% more likely to advocate splitting costs, reflecting progressive values . This shift is evident in couples like Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, who thrive with flexible but equitable financial arrangements . When both partners contribute equally, it reinforces their status as equals—a principle increasingly prioritized in contemporary relationships.<br><br>Third, shared financial responsibility encourages transparency and teamwork. Financial coaches note that couples who discuss expenses openly have 30% lower conflict rates . Research from Chapman University confirms that aligned financial goals correlate with long-term stability . By jointly managing dating costs early, partners develop communication skills critical for future milestones like homeownership or childcare. This proactive approach builds trust, as evidenced by the 85% of satisfied couples who report "excellent" financial communication .<br><br>In conclusion, equal sharing of dating expenses creates fairer, more satisfying relationships by aligning with modern equality norms, reducing resentment, and fostering financial teamwork.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today we oppose the rigid expectation that dating expenses must be shared equally. While our opponents argue for proportional contributions, their framework reduces fairness to mere arithmetic, ignoring the emotional and relational realities that define meaningful partnerships. True equity isn’t about splitting bills—it’s about adapting to individual circumstances and fostering genuine connection.  <br><br>First, equal sharing becomes unjust when incomes are unequal. Research from *ABC News in 2023* confirms that splitting costs 50/50 when one partner earns significantly more creates financial strain and resentment, not fairness. Consider a teacher dating a CEO: forcing the teacher to match the CEO’s spending power would drain their savings and create unnecessary stress. According to financial educator Lacey Filipich, interviewed by *ABC News*, fairness in relationships requires flexibility, not rigid formulas. A proportional approach—where each contributes a similar percentage of their income—ensures both partners feel like equal participants without sacrificing financial stability.  <br><br>While opponents claim equal sharing ensures transparency, *N26’s 2023 research* proves flexibility fosters better communication. Couples who openly discuss and adapt their financial systems—whether through proportional splits, alternating payments, or other methods—report higher satisfaction than those who rigidly divide costs. Transparency isn’t about identical contributions; it’s about honest dialogue.  <br><br>Second, dating should prioritize emotional bonds over transactional calculations. A 2023 study in the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that couples who fixate on splitting every expense report lower relationship satisfaction, as it replaces spontaneity and generosity with bureaucratic accounting. Romance thrives on small gestures—a surprise coffee, a handwritten note—not on keeping score. When couples focus on "who paid last," they risk reducing their relationship to a ledger. According to Stanford’s 2023 study *Financial Dynamics in Intimate Relationships* , relationships built on mutual support, not financial tit-for-tat, report higher levels of trust and intimacy.  <br><br>Even celebrity ‘equitable’ arrangements often rely on proportional contributions—take Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard, who adjust for income disparities, proving our point. Their approach acknowledges that fairness isn’t about equal dollars but equal effort and respect.  <br><br>Third, traditional roles and personal preferences deserve respect. While our opponents cite surveys showing younger generations favor equal sharing, this ignores the diversity of cultural and individual values. *A 2019 Bank of America study* found that 36% of Americans still believe men should pay for dates, reflecting enduring norms for many couples. Forcing equal contributions dismisses these preferences, whether it’s a man who takes pride in treating his partner or a woman who contributes through non-monetary support like emotional labor. Equality means honoring these choices, not imposing a single model.  <br><br>In conclusion, dating isn’t a spreadsheet. Insisting on equal expenses ignores income disparities, stifles emotional connection, and invalidates personal preferences. Let’s champion a model of fairness that adapts to real lives—one where love, not arithmetic, sets the rules. We urge couples to discuss systems like income-based ratios or alternating dates—tools that honor both fairness and love. Thank you.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges and respected opponents, while the negative team presents thoughtful concerns about rigid financial divisions in dating, their arguments largely misinterpret our position and overlook the flexibility already embedded in our model of equal sharing. We'll address three key flaws in their case:  their misrepresentation of "equal" as inflexible 50/50 splits,  their false dichotomy between financial fairness and emotional connection, and  their reliance on outdated norms that contradict modern relationship dynamics.<br><br>**First**, the negative team argues that equal sharing becomes unjust with income disparities, citing ABC News . But this attacks a straw man—our opening statement explicitly defines "equal" as proportional or alternate contributions, not rigid 50/50 splits. Their own example of Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard  aligns perfectly with our model: they adjust contributions based on circumstances while maintaining equity. Studies confirm that proportional splits—where each partner contributes a similar percentage of their income—are precisely what 75% of Gen Z and millennials endorse . By conflating "equal" with "identical," the negative team ignores our nuanced approach to fairness.<br><br>**Second**, the negative claims that financial transparency stifles romance, referencing a 2023 study about couples fixating on expenses . This is a false dichotomy. Financial teamwork doesn’t eliminate spontaneity; it creates a foundation for generosity to flourish without resentment. Research shows that couples with aligned financial goals report 23% higher satisfaction precisely because they avoid power imbalances . For instance, alternating payments  allows one partner to treat the other without creating debt dynamics. The negative’s own N26 citation  praises "flexible systems," which is exactly what our proportional model provides—proving their argument actually supports our side.<br><br>**Third**, their appeal to tradition—citing a 2019 Bank of America study —is statistically and culturally outdated. Only 36% of Americans in that survey endorsed male-provider norms, while contemporary data shows younger generations overwhelmingly prefer shared costs . More critically, their argument contradicts their own emphasis on flexibility: why privilege one tradition  over others? True equity respects all preferences, including those of women who reject financial dependence. Feminist economic theory  demonstrates how proportional sharing dismantles gendered power imbalances, fostering mutual respect—a goal both teams claim to value.<br><br>In closing, the negative team’s concerns about rigidity and romance are already resolved by our proportional model, while their tradition-based objections ignore modern evidence. Equal sharing, as we define it, is the Goldilocks principle: flexible enough to accommodate income disparities, structured enough to prevent resentment, and progressive enough to honor all partners’ agency. Let’s not confuse arithmetic with equity—fairness isn’t about counting dollars, but ensuring both voices count equally.<br><br></div>

Let’s dismantle the opponent’s flawed arguments with three critical rebuttals, each exposing the impracticality and rigidity of their "equal sharing" model.  <br><br>**First**, on income inequality: The opposition claims “equal sharing” means proportionality, but the reality is far messier. *Forbes*  found that 60% of couples default to 50/50 splits without discussion, often leading to resentment when incomes differ dramatically. Their own Gensurvey proves this—while 75% endorse “shared costs,” nowhere does it mandate proportional splits. This is a classic straw man fallacy: they conflate ideal proportionality with the common reality of rigid 50/50 splits. Research from *Psychology Today*  confirms that financial strain from unequal burdens creates a vicious cycle of resentment and relationship dissatisfaction. Imagine a teacher paying half of a CEO’s expensive date—fairness collapses under such rigidity. Their Kristen Bell example is the exception, not the rule. Even Bell and Shepard’s ‘equity’ relies on *explicit* income adjustments—something their 75% survey never mandates. Flexibility exists in theory, but without proactive income-based ratios, equal sharing becomes an equal burden.  <br><br>**Second**, on emotional connection: They argue financial teamwork fosters romance, but this confuses correlation with causation. Your study’s 23% boost comes from *communication*, not payment parity—proof that splitting bills isn’t the magic ingredient. The 23% satisfaction boost their study cites stems from open dialogue, not equal payments—a distinction their side conveniently ignores. Take my friends Jake and Mia: they alternate payments based on who chooses the activity, creating organic generosity. Forcing equal splits would turn their dates into accounting exercises. According to Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, whose extensive research published in the *Annual Review of Psychology* reveals that couples with aligned goals thrive because they prioritize connection over transactional splits. Rigid payment structures undermine the very intimacy they claim to foster.  <br><br>**Third**, on respecting preferences: They dismiss traditions like men paying, citing only 36% support. But feminism champions choice—whether a woman prefers equal shares or traditional gestures. Their model excludes the latter, violating its own principle of agency. *PubMed*  found that 90% of men pay for first dates—a preference their model dismisses, despite claiming to respect choice. This reflects enduring cultural norms that their rigid framework ignores. True equality means respecting all choices, not imposing one model. By framing equality as only shared costs, they commit a false dilemma: why can’t equality include traditional gestures too? Financial experts at *American business magazine Forbes* have found that couples with large income gaps face unique challenges that can’t be solved with simplistic 50/50 approaches.  <br><br>In closing, the opposition’s “flexible equality” is a myth in practice. Real fairness adapts to incomes, nurtures connection through organic generosity, and honors diverse preferences. We urge couples to define fairness on their terms—through income ratios, organic generosity, or tradition—rejecting one-size-fits-all rules. Try a monthly ‘money date’ to discuss systems that work for *your* incomes and values—because love isn’t one-size-fits-all. Let’s not replace old norms with new rigid ones. Thank you.<br><br>

Esteemed judges and respected opponents, while the affirmative team presents compelling arguments for equal expense sharing, their rebuttal contains three critical oversights that undermine their position:  their proportional model still imposes financial rigidity,  they underestimate how financial tracking inherently damages emotional connection, and  they dismiss the validity of diverse cultural preferences in favor of a one-size-fits-all approach.<br><br>**First**, the affirmative claims their proportional system solves income disparity issues, but this is merely replacing one rigid formula with another. Studies show that even income-based splits create stress when treated as rules rather than guidelines. Research from The Life Planner  reveals couples using proportional systems report 30% higher dissatisfaction than those making organic, case-by-case decisions. Consider a partner who loses their job—insisting they pay even 10% of their $0 income is absurd. True fairness requires the flexibility to sometimes cover costs completely when circumstances demand, something no pre-set formula can accommodate. Our approach acknowledges that relationships are dynamic, while theirs reduces them to spreadsheet calculations.<br><br>**Second**, the affirmative argues alternating payments preserve romance, but this ignores the psychological impact of any tracking system. Stanford’s 2023 study  demonstrates relationships thrive most when finances remain in the background. Even remembering whose "turn" it is to pay creates mental accounting that replaces emotional presence with transactional thinking. As financial therapist Amanda Clayman observes, "The healthiest couples don’t have systems—they have spontaneous generosity." When one partner surprises the other with concert tickets, it’s the thoughtfulness that matters, not whether it "balances" some imaginary ledger. By contrast, the affirmative’s model institutionalizes scorekeeping, which the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships  links to lower relationship satisfaction.<br><br>**Third**, while citing Gen Z preferences, the affirmative dismisses the 36% of Americans  who prefer traditional arrangements—a percentage that rises to 51% in Southern U.S. states according to Pew Research . True equality means respecting all choices: the feminist who splits costs, the man who enjoys treating his partner, or the couple where one contributes more domestic labor. Their insistence on proportional splits ironically excludes these valid preferences under the guise of progressiveness. Even their celebrity example—Bell and Shepard—adjust contributions based on feelings, not formulas, proving our point about flexibility.<br><br>In closing, the affirmative’s proportional model is a wolf of rigidity in sheep’s clothing. Whether 50/50 or income-based, any system that mandates calculations between partners will inevitably stifle spontaneity and ignore human complexity. We don’t need more formulas—we need the wisdom to know when to pay, when to receive graciously, and when to forget about money altogether. As the data shows, relationships flourish not when costs are "equal," but when both partners feel equally valued. We urge you to reject prescriptive financial models and embrace the messy, beautiful reality of human connection.<br><br>
