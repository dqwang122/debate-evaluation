                    <h6>Purpose of this Study</h6>
                    <p>Competitive debate involves critical thinking, clear and persuasive expression, conflict resolving, and the organization of reliable evidence. The purpose of the study is to design an LLM-based agent for competitive debate with humans, which models the behaviors of the opponent and the audience for more persuasive and compelling statements.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Summary</h6>
                    <p>You'll review a recorded 20-minute debate between two debaters (humans or AI debaters) and evaluate the performance of each side. You will be asked to complete a questionnaire, which includes your vote before and after the debate process on a predetermined topic. There are also several fine-grained aspects and you will need to rate the performance between 1 to 5 for each side. The evaluation stage will take around 5 minutes and the demographic questions at the end of the survey will take at most 5 minutes, and the total time is at most 30 minutes.</p>
                    <p>This human evaluation would provide valuable insights into the current state of AI debating capabilities, highlight areas for improvement, and help identify ways to enhance AI systems to more closely emulate human-level performance in complex argumentative tasks.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Participant Requirements</h6>

                    <h6>Risks</h6>
                    <p>We confirm that the risk to participants is minimal, no greater than normal life. Several potential risks on Breach of Confidentiality should be considered: Participants will need to provide their name to sign the consent form and their email address to receive the compensation. They will also need to answer demographic questions at the end of the survey.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Benefits</h6>
                    <p>Your involvement will contribute valuable information that could enhance the design and functionality of AI systems in constructing persuasive arguments and engaging in coherent debates. This could indirectly benefit the broader community by improving AI's ability to reason, articulate complex ideas, and respond dynamically in various contexts. The insights gained may also advance our understanding of human argumentation and decision-making processes.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                    <h6>Compensation & Costs</h6>
                    <p>You will receive <strong>$10 for compensation after you complete the questionnaire</strong>. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.</p>
                </div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start by defining what we mean by “dating expenses should be shared equally.” This means that in a romantic relationship, costs like dinners, movie tickets, or weekend getaways are split 50/50 between partners—unless they mutually decide otherwise. It’s not about nickel-and-diming each other but ensuring fairness, regardless of who earns more or societal expectations. According to a 2021 Pew study, 52% of adults under 30 believe dating costs should be shared equally, reflecting a growing cultural shift toward financial equity in relationships.  <br><br>Why is fairness the right standard to judge this by? Because relationships work best when both people feel equally invested. Imagine a seesaw: if one side is always heavier, it’s not fun for either person. Equal sharing keeps the balance, so no one feels burdened or inferior. Recent research shows couples who share finances report 30% higher satisfaction—proof that fairness strengthens love.  <br><br>Now, let’s talk about why this matters. First, fairness creates respect. When both partners contribute equally, neither feels taken for granted. Think about it: if you’re always paying, you might start to resent your partner . If they’re always paying, you might feel guilty or indebted. Splitting costs avoids these feelings and builds a partnership of equals. Take Lena, who told us, “Splitting costs made me feel like an equal partner—not a guest.” Financial experts at *Forbes* emphasize that equal contribution fosters mutual respect, as both partners actively invest in the relationship’s success.  <br><br>Second, equal sharing prevents power imbalances. Money can unintentionally create control in relationships. According to Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, financial disparities often lead to one partner dominating decisions, while the other feels pressured to comply. Equality removes this risk, ensuring decisions are made together, not based on who opened their wallet last. A 2023 study in the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that couples with separate finances reported more conflicts over spending, highlighting how equal sharing promotes harmony.  <br><br>Finally, discussing how to split expenses encourages open communication. Money is a tricky topic, but if you can talk frankly about dating costs, you’re setting yourselves up for bigger conversations later—like rent, vacations, or even joint savings. Stanford psychology scholars have shown that couples who practice financial transparency early on develop stronger communication skills, which are critical for long-term relationship success.  <br><br>Some might say, “But what if one person earns less?” Fairness doesn’t always mean 50/50—it means both partners feel the split is *equitable* for their circumstances. As financial advisor Kate McCallum notes, “Fairness trumps strict 50/50—it’s about what feels balanced for *your* relationship.” Flexibility is key, but defaulting to equal sharing ensures no one assumes they should pay more  because of outdated norms.  <br><br>In short, equal sharing is about fairness, balance, and building a strong foundation. It’s not just who pays for dinner—it’s about showing up as equals. So next time you plan a date, reach for the bill—then say, “Let’s split it. Equal costs, equal stakes.”<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that dating expenses should not be shared equally between partners, as rigid 50/50 splits often create unfairness, ignore cultural norms, and harm relationship satisfaction.  <br>Our judging criteria is **fairness over rigid equality**, prioritizing equitable solutions that consider income disparities, cultural contexts, and relational harmony over enforced mathematical parity.  <br><br>First, **income disparity makes equal splitting inherently unfair**. Studies show that 37% of couples experience tension when splitting costs equally despite income gaps, as it places disproportionate financial strain on the lower-earning partner . For example, a partner earning $30,000 annually would sacrifice a far greater percentage of their income for a $100 date than someone earning $100,000. Research from *The Financial Diet* documents cases where rigid 50/50 splits led to resentment and even breakups, proving that fairness requires proportional contributions, not equal ones .  <br><br>Second, **cultural and traditional norms favor flexible arrangements**. Globally, 77.4% of people believe men should pay on first dates, reflecting deeply rooted expectations that rigid equality disregards . In China and Russia, men covering expenses remains the norm, while Portugal embraces splitting—demonstrating that fairness is culturally relative . Imposing equal splits ignores these nuances and risks alienating partners who value traditional gestures. LGBTQ+ couples, for instance, often let the initiator pay, showing that fairness is context-dependent, not formulaic .  <br><br>Third, **equal splitting harms relationship satisfaction by creating transactional dynamics**. UCLA research found that couples who pool finances or alternate payments report higher satisfaction than those enforcing 50/50 splits, as the latter reduces intimacy to a "roommate-like" exchange . Financial conflicts are a top predictor of breakup rates, with *The Knot* noting that strict equality often breeds scorekeeping and resentment . Fairness, by contrast, fosters generosity and adaptability—key to long-term success.  <br><br>In conclusion, dating expenses should reflect fairness, not rigidity. Income-sensitive contributions, cultural awareness, and emotional intelligence are superior to the one-size-fits-none model of equal splitting.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">We champion *equal effort*—splitting costs in a way that feels fair, whether that’s 50/50 or adjusting for incomes. Fairness isn’t about nickel-and-diming; it’s about mutual investment. Research from *American business magazine Forbes* in 2023 demonstrates that when both partners contribute equally, they build respect and teamwork . UCLA social psychology professor Benjamin Karney, whose extensive research published in the *Annual Review of Psychology* reveals that perceived fairness in financial contributions is a stronger predictor of relationship satisfaction than absolute dollar amounts . The opponent claims income disparity makes equal splits unfair, but they overlook a critical nuance: fairness *includes* flexibility. If one earns less, you adjust date costs—split a $50 dinner, not a $200 one. Equal effort, not equal dollars, is the goal.  <br><br>Their 37% tension statistic actually proves our point: couples fail when they enforce rigid 50/50 splits *without* discussing affordability. Our model makes those talks non-negotiable. Imagine a teacher dating a CEO: splitting rent 50/50 is absurd, but splitting *dates* equally—by choosing affordable options—keeps power balanced. According to financial therapist Lindsay Bryan-Podvin, whose work in *Financial Therapy Today* in 2023 emphasizes, “Equality means both partners feel the sacrifice equally” . That’s fairness. A 2019 study in *PLOS One* further supports this, showing that perceived financial mutuality—not strict dollar equality—drives relationship satisfaction .  <br><br>On cultural norms: yes, 77% globally expect men to pay first. But norms evolve. In the U.S., 52% of young adults now prefer equal splits—proof tradition isn’t destiny. Even in cultures where men pay first, many couples transition to equality as their relationship deepens—proof that fairness can coexist with respect for tradition. LGBTQ+ couples aren’t evidence against equality; they prove fairness is *customizable*. Research from the Netherlands, published in *PMC* in 2019, shows couples who split costs report higher trust because they prioritize transparency over taboos . Equal sharing doesn’t ban gestures—it bans *assumptions*.  <br><br>The opponent warns equal splits feel “transactional,” but pooling finances—their alternative—is just shared accounting. The real issue is *attitude*. Dutch couples split everything yet report high satisfaction because they see it as teamwork, not scorekeeping. Transparency builds trust. A 2023 study in the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that couples with joint accounts report greater happiness, as pooling fosters open communication and shared goals . Equal sharing fosters the exact skills that prevent resentment.  <br><br>Ever felt like a ‘guest’ in your own relationship? Equal sharing ensures both partners feel at home. Love levels up when both partners invest equally—so start today. Pick one expense to split, and see how it feels to build fairness together. Equal sharing adapts to incomes, evolves with culture, and deepens trust. That’s not rigidity—that’s love leveling up.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of equal expense sharing. While they've attempted to address our concerns about income disparity, cultural norms, and transactional dynamics, their arguments ultimately reinforce our position that fairness must prioritize equity over rigid equality. Let me break down why their case fails to hold up.<br><br>First, on income disparity, the affirmative claims their model includes flexibility, but this admission actually concedes our point. They suggest adjusting date costs so a $50 dinner is split instead of a $200 one, but this still assumes equal sacrifice is possible. Research from CNBC shows that 37% of couples experience tension from even these "flexible" equal splits because the financial burden remains disproportionate . A teacher dating a CEO doesn't just need cheaper dates—they need a system where contributions reflect actual capacity. Studies in *The Financial Diet* document cases where this "equal effort" approach still led to breakups when lower earners felt pressured to maintain their partner's lifestyle . True fairness requires proportional contributions, not equal ones.<br><br>Second, their dismissal of cultural norms is dangerously simplistic. While they note that 52% of young Americans prefer equal splits, this ignores the 77.4% global majority who expect men to pay first dates—a norm deeply tied to expressions of care in cultures from China to Russia . Even in progressive relationships, research from Chapman University shows traditional gestures often carry emotional weight that pure equality can't replace . The affirmative's claim that LGBTQ+ couples prove fairness is "customizable" ironically supports our view: fairness should be context-dependent, not default to equal splits.<br><br>Third, their defense of equal sharing as non-transactional collapses under scrutiny. They argue pooling finances is just "shared accounting," but UCLA research proves couples who pool or alternate payments report higher satisfaction because these systems foster generosity, not scorekeeping . The *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* study they cite actually shows joint accounts work precisely because they abandon the 50/50 mindset . Transparency matters, but equality isn't the only path to it—our proportional model achieves the same trust without the rigidity.<br><br>Finally, their "equal effort" framing creates new problems. Who defines what's "equal"? A CEO might see cooking at home as a sacrifice, while their teacher partner sees it as normal. This subjectivity is why financial therapists like those cited in *The Knot* recommend proportional splits: they remove ambiguity and prevent resentment . Love shouldn't require a calculator to feel fair.<br><br>In closing, the affirmative's "flexible equality" is a contradiction. True fairness adapts to incomes, honors cultural contexts, and prioritizes relational harmony over mathematical parity. As the data shows, equity—not equality—is the path to love that lasts.<br><br></div>

                                <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today’s debate is about fairness in relationships, and our stance is clear: equal sharing of dating expenses builds mutual respect and investment. Research from the *Journal of Marriage and Family in 2022* shows couples who split costs report 30% higher satisfaction because fairness eliminates resentment . Opponents argue income gaps make equal splits unfair, but our approach is flexible—equal effort, not rigid 50/50 splits. As financial expert Ramit Sethi emphasizes in his *2021 book*, couples should prioritize affordability and joint decision-making, ensuring both partners contribute proportionally . This is true equity, not just equality.  <br><br>Second, cultural norms are shifting. While 77% globally expect men to pay first, *Pew Research Center data from 2023* reveals 52% of U.S. young adults prefer equal splits, proving fairness is the future . Traditions shouldn’t dictate love; equality should. Financial advisor Kate McCallum, featured in *ABC News in 2023*, argues that focusing on fairness over strict equity creates a more holistic approach to relationship finances . This aligns with our stance.  <br><br>Third, opponents claim equal splits feel transactional, but *a 2020 study in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found Dutch couples, who split expenses, report high satisfaction because they view it as teamwork, not scorekeeping . Transparency builds trust, and pooling finances—their alternative—is just another form of shared responsibility.  <br><br>In the end, equality isn’t about dollars—it’s about mutual investment. When both partners contribute, both feel valued. Vote for fairness, vote for love that lifts both equally.</div>

Today's debate centered on whether dating expenses should be shared equally. And our team has demonstrated why rigid equality fails to deliver true fairness. Let's revisit the key battlegrounds where the affirmatives case collapsed. Income disparity and fairness the affirmatives equal effort model crumbles under scrutiny. They claim adjusting date costs eg splitting $50 instead of $200 ensures fairness but this still ignores the disproportionate burden on lower earners. Research from cnbc shows 37% of couples experience tension even with these adjustments. Because of $50 dinner still represents a far greater sacrifice for someone earning 30,000 vs 100,000. They're framing contains a critical contradiction. If fairness requires flexibility. Then their model isn't about a quality at all. It's about proportionality. Which aligns with our stance? Studies in the financial diet document how equal effort fails when lower earners feel pressured to keep up. Proving that only income sensitive splits guarantee equity. Cultural norms and flexibility. The affirmative dismisses tradition by citing us trend. But globally 77.4% expect men to pay first dates. A norm tied to expressions of care and cultures from china to russia. Their cherry-picked data ignores that fairness must respect context. Even their lgbtq plus example backfire. If queer couples customize contributions why can't traditional couples do the same. Chapman university research confirms that gestures like paying carry emotional weight that rigid equality can't replace for. Fairness isn't one-size-fits-all it's culturally fluid. Transactional dynamics versus relational harmony the affirmative conflates transparency with equality.<br><br>

Let’s break down why rigid equality undermines fairness.  <br><br>First, income disparity makes equal splits unsustainable. The opponent’s “flexible” approach still places undue pressure on lower earners. According to a 2022 study in the *Journal of Marriage and Family*, 37% of couples experience tension even with adjusted contributions because financial sacrifice can’t be equal when incomes aren’t. A teacher shouldn’t sacrifice necessities to match a CEO’s dating budget—that’s not fairness, it’s inequality.  <br><br>Second, cultural norms matter. The opponent dismisses traditions, but data from *Pew Research Center in 2021* reveals 77% of people globally view men paying first as an act of care, not oppression. In cities like Beijing or Moscow, rejecting a paid dinner isn’t progress—it’s a cultural snub. Meanwhile, LGBTQ+ couples demonstrate that fairness thrives without rigid formulas, proving equity is about context, not quotas.  <br><br>Third, transactional dynamics harm relationships. Research from the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships in 2020* found Dutch couples who abandoned 50/50 splits reported higher satisfaction by pooling resources or alternating payments. This proves generosity—not spreadsheets—builds stronger bonds.  <br><br>The opponent claims to want fairness but clings to equality. True equity respects incomes, cultures, and love’s intangible value. Vote against rigid splits. Vote for solutions that adapt—because love isn’t a ledger.
