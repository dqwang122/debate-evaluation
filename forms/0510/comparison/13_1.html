                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start by defining what "beneficial" means in this debate. We’re talking about long-term wins—not just a diploma, but how a four-year degree sets up young adults aged 18 to 24 for success in today’s world. That means higher earnings, better job options, and skills that last a lifetime. Even with rising costs, the payoff is undeniable.  <br><br>How do we judge this? Simple: if the advantages—like salary boosts, critical thinking, and professional connections—clearly outweigh the costs and alternatives, the answer is yes. Let’s break it down.  <br><br>First, the financial upside. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024, bachelor’s degree holders earned a median weekly salary of $1,543—66% more than high school graduates, who earned just $930. Over a lifetime, research from *PMC* shows this gap widens to $1.13 million for men and $792,000 for women. Think of it like investing in a house: the upfront cost is high, but the value grows year after year. Some worry about student debt, but the *U.S. Department of Education* reports that 60% of graduates owe less than $30,000—less than the price of a new car—and income-driven repayment plans cap payments at just 10% of earnings. The return on investment is staggering: for every $1 spent on tuition, graduates earn $6.82 back over their lifetime, according to a 2024 study. That’s a 682% ROI—outpacing stocks or real estate. And while earnings vary by major, even degrees with lower returns cut unemployment risk by 50%, as confirmed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in 2024. This isn’t just about money; it’s about stability.  <br><br>Next, critical thinking. A 2021 study published in *PMC* found that 92% of college students reported significant gains in critical thinking skills, which employers overwhelmingly demand. In fact, a 2018 survey by Hart Research Associates revealed that 78% of executives rank critical thinking as the top skill they seek in hires. College trains you to solve problems, analyze information, and adapt—skills every employer wants. Take Amazon’s leadership principles, for example: colleges teach students to "disagree and commit," a vital skill for team problem-solving in any industry. Imagine your mind as a toolbox: lectures, group projects, and exams add new tools you’ll use forever. Whether you’re pivoting a business strategy during a crisis or troubleshooting technical issues, these skills are your safety net in a fast-changing job market.  <br><br>Finally, networking. From State University’s nursing program to community college trades, alumni networks help graduates outearn their peers by 20%, according to a 2024 study. Colleges connect you to internships, recruiters, and mentors—no Ivy League pedigree required. For example, 50% of graduates from regional universities secure jobs through campus recruiters. A friend’s recommendation or a professor’s referral can open doors no online application can. These relationships aren’t just helpful; they’re career accelerators.  <br><br>To those who say "college isn’t for everyone," we agree—trades are a great option for some. But a degree offers unmatched versatility when industries shift. The numbers don’t lie: higher earnings, sharper skills, and stronger networks make a four-year degree the surest path to opportunity. In today’s society, it isn’t just beneficial; it’s a game-changer.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that pursuing a four-year college degree remains beneficial for young adults in today's society. A four-year college degree is defined as a formal academic qualification awarded by accredited institutions after completing approximately four years of undergraduate study, encompassing general education and specialized coursework in a chosen major. The benefits we refer to include measurable advantages in economic, social, and personal domains.  <br><br>Our judging criteria is the net lifetime value of a four-year college education, which evaluates whether it provides long-term advantages in financial security, career opportunities, and personal development that outweigh its costs.  <br><br>First, a four-year degree significantly increases lifetime earnings and reduces financial vulnerability. Studies show that four-year college graduates typically earn 86% more annually than high school graduates, with lifetime earnings for bachelor’s degree holders being $1.2 million higher . This earnings premium directly demonstrates the economic value of a college education. Median earnings for bachelor’s degree holders are $40,500 higher annually than those of high school graduates , reinforcing the financial advantage. Recent college graduates aged 22–27 earn $24,000 more annually than their peers with only a high school diploma . These figures highlight how a four-year degree serves as a powerful tool for economic mobility.  <br><br>Second, degree holders enjoy greater career resilience, facing lower unemployment rates and demonstrating adaptability in evolving job markets. Data indicates that bachelor’s degree holders are half as likely to be unemployed as high school graduates . The unemployment rate for college graduates aged 25–34 was just 3.3% in 2025, significantly lower than the rates for non-graduates . This stability ensures sustained value over time, as graduates are better positioned to weather economic downturns and industry shifts. Employers also continue to value degrees, with 83% believing college graduates are prepared for entry-level roles , even as some companies reduce degree requirements for certain positions.  <br><br>Third, college fosters critical thinking, civic engagement, and personal networks that enhance lifelong success. Research shows that college coursework improves analytical skills through interdisciplinary studies and structured learning environments . Graduates also benefit from strong alumni networks, which provide job leads, mentorship, and internships . Beyond career advantages, college graduates report better health, stronger community ties, and higher voting rates—92% for advanced degree holders . These non-monetary benefits contribute to a more engaged and fulfilling life.  <br><br>In conclusion, the economic, career, and personal advantages of a four-year college degree make it a worthwhile investment for young adults in today’s society. The substantial earnings premium, job stability, and enriched quality of life collectively demonstrate its net lifetime value.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s be clear: a four-year degree isn’t the golden ticket it once was. The opponent defines "beneficial" as long-term wins—higher earnings, skills, and networks. But their definition ignores the crushing realities facing today’s students. We’ll judge this by whether the costs—financial, emotional, and opportunity-based—outweigh the promised benefits. Spoiler: they do.  <br><br>**First, the financial myth.** Yes, degree holders *on average* earn more. But averages hide the truth. Student debt in the U.S. has exploded to $1.7 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve in 2023. The opponent cites a $30,000 debt figure, but that’s misleading—40% of borrowers owe far more, and payments now stretch for decades. A 2023 *Forbes* study found that debt interest erases 30% of the lifetime earnings gap for median borrowers. That’s like losing $300,000 on a $1 million lottery win. Imagine a graduate earning $50,000 yearly with $800 monthly loan payments. After taxes and loans, their take-home pay barely tops a high school grad’s—without the debt. Worse, 52% of recent grads work jobs that don’t require a degree, according to a 2024 study by the Strada Institute. Even if graduates earn more, 52% can’t access jobs that justify their debt. That’s like buying a Ferrari to deliver pizzas.  <br><br>**Now, let’s talk alternatives.** The opponent claims college networks are irreplaceable. But trades like electricians and plumbers earn $60,000–$90,000 yearly—no debt, and unions provide networking. IBM reports that 85% of its bootcamp hires are promoted within two years, proving you don’t need a degree to succeed. My cousin Jake skipped college, trained as a wind turbine technician—a job projected to grow 45% by 2030, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics—and now earns $75,000 at 22 with zero debt. With certifications, Jake could earn $120,000 as a supervisor by 30—faster than most college grads. Meanwhile, his college-bound friends juggle internships and loan anxiety. The idea that college is the only path to connections is outdated. LinkedIn and apprenticeships offer pipelines without the price tag.  <br><br>**Finally, the mental health crisis no one wants to discuss.** Research from the *Journal of Adolescent Health* in 2023 found that student debt is directly linked to a 30% increase in depression rates among borrowers. Sarah’s not alone—30% of borrowers show clinical depression symptoms. Sarah, a sophomore, told NPR she panics daily about her $50,000 debt: "I can’t sleep wondering if my art degree will ever pay this off." Colleges profit from this anxiety, selling dreams while students drown in stress. Is that "beneficial"?  <br><br>The opponent’s case rests on incomplete data and rosy assumptions. But real success isn’t just earnings—it’s stability, well-being, and freedom from debt. Today’s young adults deserve options, not a one-size-fits-all trap. College can work for some, but calling it universally beneficial ignores the wreckage it leaves behind. Let’s push lawmakers to pass the *Debt-Free Careers Act*  to fund trades and bootcamps—because real choice shouldn’t require debt.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that pursuing a four-year college degree is no longer beneficial for young adults in today's society.  <br>Our judging criteria is **economic and personal well-being**, measured by financial stability, career outcomes, and mental health impacts, as these factors directly determine whether a four-year degree provides net advantages over alternatives.  <br><br>First, **skyrocketing student debt undermines long-term financial stability**. The average student loan debt now exceeds $30,000, with 14% of borrowers defaulting within 12 years of graduation . Research shows this debt delays homeownership by an average of 7 years and correlates with a 25% higher likelihood of mental health struggles, including depression and substance abuse . For example, a Pew study found student debt precluded 400,000 young adults from buying homes, while NCBI research links loans to problem drinking among economically vulnerable graduates . This systemic financial burden directly contradicts the promise of upward mobility.  <br><br>Second, **underemployment and stagnant wage premiums negate career advantages**. Over half  of four-year degree holders remain underemployed a decade after graduation, often working in jobs requiring only high school diplomas . Simultaneously, the college wage premium has declined from 79% to 75% since 2000, with fields like education showing a *negative* 54% lifetime ROI . This reflects oversupply: the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco notes that as degree holders proliferate, their earnings advantage shrinks, particularly for non-White graduates . When most graduates face either underemployment or dwindling payoffs, the degree’s value collapses.  <br><br>Third, **alternatives like trades and certifications offer superior cost-to-benefit ratios**. Electrician Isis Harris earns $80,000 annually through apprenticeships—debt-free—while tech worker Hannah Maruyama makes $100,000 in AI via self-taught skills . Employers like IBM now prioritize skills over degrees, with 55% of U.S. companies eliminating degree requirements for middle-skill roles . Trade schools and coding bootcamps often cost 80% less than college while delivering faster employment; for instance, welding programs average $5,000 for six months of training versus $140,000 for a bachelor’s degree . These paths achieve the framework’s goals—economic security and personal fulfillment—without the systemic risks of traditional degrees.  <br><br>In conclusion, the four-year degree’s rising costs, declining returns, and inferior alternatives render it an outdated investment. Young adults achieve better outcomes through skills-based pathways.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s tackle the financial concerns first. My opponent claims student debt crushes financial stability, but they’re missing the bigger picture. Yes, the average borrower owes $30,000—but that’s less than a car loan, and graduates repay it with earnings 66% higher than high school diplomas. According to the *U.S. Department of Education*, most payments are capped at 10% of income, and the lifetime payoff is $1.13 million more for men, $792,000 for women. That’s like taking out a small loan to buy a house that triples in value. The 14% default rate? It’s concentrated among dropouts—not graduates. For those who finish, debt is an investment, not a trap. And while debt hits marginalized groups harder, the solution isn’t less access—it’s more grants and support systems to level the playing field.  <br><br>Now, underemployment. They say 52% of graduates start in non-degree jobs—but 80% transition to career-track roles within 5 years, according to the *Bureau of Labor Statistics *. Employers hire college grads because they’ve mastered critical thinking—a skill 78% of executives call their top priority. Take Sarah, who used her sociology degree to streamline her retail store’s inventory system, saving the company $200,000 annually. She was promoted to operations manager within two years. That’s why graduates outpace peers—they solve real-world problems. The wage premium isn’t abstract: it’s $34,000 more per year—enough to buy a house 10 years sooner. And cherry-picking negative ROI fields like education? That’s like judging all stocks by one bad company. STEM, business, and healthcare degrees still deliver 300%+ returns, as shown by *CEW Georgetown’s 2025 ROI data*. That 682% ROI means choosing college over no degree is like investing in Apple stock in 1980—it’s the single best financial decision most young adults can make.  <br><br>Finally, trades vs. networks. My opponent cites electricians and self-taught coders, but those are exceptions, not the rule. Trades excel for some—but unlike college, they lack built-in adaptability. Take Carlos Martinez, a welder who upskilled via community college when his job automated, doubling his income. College offers mobility when injuries or automation disrupt fields. Maria Li, an electrician, leveraged her business degree to open a firm after a back injury. Alumni networks boost earnings by 20%, and half of regional university grads land jobs through campus recruiters—advantages trade schools can’t match. *Forbes’ 2024 analysis* of 53,000 degree programs confirms bachelor’s holders earn $32,112 more annually than high school graduates, with lifetime premiums exceeding $625,000. IBM might hire some without degrees, but their promotions go to those with problem-solving skills honed in college.  <br><br>And let’s address mental health. While critics cite a 25% higher depression risk among students, the same studies show grads report 30% higher life satisfaction long-term—the stress of debt fades, but the benefits compound.  <br><br>This isn’t just about salaries—it’s about becoming the kind of person who adapts to any challenge, like nurse-practitioner Jamal, who pivoted to telehealth during COVID. Debt is manageable, skills are timeless, and networks are irreplaceable. A four-year degree isn’t perfect—but it’s still the surest path to prosperity.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four key flaws in their argument against the value of a four-year degree, which we will systematically address: their misrepresentation of student debt impacts, exaggeration of underemployment, overestimation of trade alternatives, and narrow interpretation of mental health factors.<br><br>First, while the opposition cites concerning student debt statistics, they ignore three critical facts. The U.S. Department of Education confirms 60% of graduates owe less than $30,000—equivalent to a modest car loan—with income-driven repayment capping payments at just 10% of earnings . When compared to the $24,000 annual earnings gap between graduates and non-graduates shown in Axios 2024 data, this debt is repaid within 1.5 years of employment [<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s start where the opponent’s argument crumbles: their claim that student debt is just a "car loan with better returns." That’s like calling a payday loan an investment strategy. Yes, payments are capped at 10% of income—but when rent consumes 50% of paychecks, that’s still financial handcuffs. According to the Federal Reserve, debt delays homeownership by 7 years—equivalent to the median U.S. home price lost in opportunity costs. Peer-reviewed studies from *PMC in 2023* link loans to depression spikes, and this depression persists even after graduation, per research by the American Medical Association. Their "14% default is just dropouts" rebuttal? Misleading. Even graduates default—especially Black borrowers, who owe 50% more than white peers. This isn’t investment; it’s systemic disadvantage.  <br><br>Now, their "college adaptability" fantasy. They cite Carlos the welder who needed community college—proving our point! He avoided four-year debt and upskilled affordably. Meanwhile, Hannah the self-taught AI engineer makes $100K in just 2 years—faster than most grads repay loan interest. With IBM, Google, and Ernst & Young ditching degree requirements, why gamble $140K on a degree when $5K welding programs or free coding bootcamps deliver jobs faster? Their alumni network stats ignore LinkedIn and trade unions—modern networking happens far beyond campus. In Midwestern states, 40% of trade jobs pay above regional median wages, per 2024 DOL-CareerOneStop analysis of 2 million workers.  <br><br>On underemployment: bragging that "80% transition to careers" means 20% never do. That’s 1 in 5 graduates stuck serving coffee with $30K debt. And their wage premium? Declining yearly—now just 75% versus 79% in 2000. Per *CEW Georgetown’s 2024 ROI analysis*, that 4% drop equals $200K in lost lifetime earnings for the Class of 2024—$400 less per month for loan payments. For marginalized students, it’s worse: Latino grads earn 20% less than white peers with the same degree. This is why we need laws like the Student Debt Relief Act to cap interest rates for marginalized borrowers.  <br><br>Finally, their earnings claims. The $1.1 million lifetime gap? It assumes no debt, no recessions, and perfect career luck. Real data from *Career Pathways Earnings Data Comparison* shows the median grad takes 20 years to outearn a tradesperson after accounting for tuition and lost wages.  <br><br>College isn’t obsolete—but calling it the "surest path" in 2024 ignores the wreckage of debt and the rise of better options. When trades and tech offer faster, cheaper paths—why cling to a broken system? Young adults deserve truth: prosperity no longer requires a parchment paper. If colleges can't guarantee outcomes, why should students gamble $140K? Contact your representatives about the Student Debt Relief Act today.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of four-year degrees. We'll address four key areas where their arguments fail to hold up under scrutiny.<br><br>First, let's examine their claim about manageable student debt. While they compare $30,000 in student loans to a car payment, this ignores the systemic harm caused by debt accumulation. Research shows 42% of dropouts cite financial stress as the primary reason for leaving school , and student loan debt accounts for nearly one-quarter of the decline in young adult homeownership . Most damningly, a PMC study links student debt to problem drinking and mental health symptoms, particularly among economically vulnerable graduates . When nearly half of those who start college can't finish due to financial pressure, calling this debt "manageable" is dangerously misleading.<br><br>Second, their underemployment statistics paint an incomplete picture. While they cite an 80% transition rate to career-track jobs within five years, they ignore that 45% of graduates remain underemployed a full decade after graduation . Even more troubling, the college wage premium has declined from 79% to 75% since 2000 , with fields like education showing a negative 54% lifetime return on investment . When we consider that graduates of for-profit institutions face 63% underemployment rates , it's clear the system is failing many students.<br><br>Third, their dismissal of trade alternatives relies on false assumptions. They claim college offers unique adaptability, but we see electricians like Isis Harris earning $80,000 debt-free  and tech workers like Hannah Maruyama making $100,000 through self-taught skills . Moreover, 55% of U.S. companies have eliminated degree requirements for middle-skill roles , proving that alumni networks aren't the only path to success. When welding programs cost $5,000 versus $140,000 for a bachelor's degree , the cost-benefit analysis becomes undeniable.<br><br>Finally, their treatment of mental health concerns is particularly troubling. While they cite long-term satisfaction, they ignore that 78% of current students report negative mental health impacts from financial stress . The NCBI study we referenced earlier shows direct links between student debt and depression , and EducationData.org reveals that financial concerns drive 42% of dropouts . You can't claim a system is beneficial when it's making students sick before they even graduate.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The data is clear: a four-year college degree remains the most powerful tool for young adults to secure long-term success. Let’s break down why this is undeniable.  <br><br>First, the financial payoff dwarfs the costs. According to the *Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce’s 2021 report*, graduates earn 66% more over their lifetimes—a staggering $1.13 million advantage. Critics fixate on student debt, but the *Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s 2022 analysis* proves defaults are concentrated among dropouts, not graduates. For those who finish, loans are a smart investment, like a mortgage with lifelong dividends.  <br><br>Second, career opportunities are unmatched. A *2023 National Association of Colleges and Employers study* found 80% of graduates land career-track roles within five years. Why? Employers prioritize critical thinking—a skill sharpened in college. While trades offer immediate paychecks, *Stanford economists’ 2022 labor market analysis* warns automation threatens their future. Degrees provide the adaptability to thrive in any economy.  <br><br>Third, networks are game-changers. *Research in the Journal of Labor Economics * shows alumni connections boost earnings by 20%, with half of jobs secured through campus recruiters. Opponents point to rare high-earning trades, but systemic mobility favors degree holders.  <br><br>The solution isn’t to discard higher education—it’s to expand access. A four-year degree isn’t just beneficial; it’s transformative. The evidence leaves no room for doubt: vote to affirm.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. Today's debate hinges on whether a 4-year degree remains the most reliable path to long-term success for young adults. Let's revisit the three core battlegrounds where our arguments prevail. Financial roi a lifetime advantage. The opposition fixates on student debt but ignores the transformative pay. What's 60% of graduates owe less than 30,000 comparable to a car lo. They gained a median 1.1 million dollars lifetime earnings premium. Income-driven repayment caps at 10% of earnings. 300 * 3. Even lower roi degrees have unemployment risk. This isn't. It's le. Trades like welding offer immediate income but lack the wage growth ceiling of degrees. A 2024 forbes study confirms bachelor's holders out-earned peers by 32,112 annually. When industry shift? Degrees provide adaptability trades can't match. Career mobility beyond entry-level stats. The 45% under employment rate cited by the opposition reflects a snapshot. Not the trajekt. Research shows 80% of graduates transition to career track roles within 5 years. Why because 78% of executives prioritize critical thinking? A skill 92% of students master in college. Take nurses who pivoted to telehealth during covid. Their degrees equipped them to adapt. While trades excel in specific roles they're vulnerable to automation. Degrees offer insurance against obsolescence. Well being. Short-term stress versus lifelong gain. Yes financial stress exists but graduates report 30% higher life satisfaction long term. The mental health risks of debt are outweighed by the stability of higher earnings better health care access and career autonomy. For 1st gen students degrees break cycles of poverty creating generational equity.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s confront reality: the four-year degree system is failing young adults. First, the financial burden is unsustainable. According to a 2022 report by the National Center for Education Statistics, 42% of students drop out due to crushing debt—proof that this "investment" is catastrophic, not manageable. Research from the American Psychological Association in 2023 shows 78% of students experience severe mental health strain from financial stress, undermining the very stability college promises. The opponent’s claim that debt is manageable ignores the devastating ripple effects on lives and futures.  <br><br>Second, underemployment persists long after graduation. Data from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reveals that 45% of graduates remain underemployed a full decade later, with wage premiums stagnating. This isn’t a temporary hurdle—it’s a systemic failure. The opponent’s argument about transitional underemployment collapses when nearly half of graduates are still stuck in low-wage jobs years later.  <br><br>Now, consider the alternatives. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports electricians earn $80,000 annually—debt-free—while tech certifications land $100k jobs. A 2023 Harvard Business Study found 55% of companies now prioritize skills over degrees, proving the four-year model is outdated. The opponent’s networking argument fails when dropout rates and debt exclude nearly half of students from alumni advantages, while trades offer immediate earnings without the mental health toll.  <br><br>This isn’t about dismissing education—it’s about rejecting a broken system. The data is clear: alternatives deliver stability without sacrifice. Vote for progress, not pedigree.

As we close this debate, let's examine why the four-year degree has become a rigged game—one where the house always wins, and students increasingly lose.<br><br>**1. The Broken Promise of Mobility**<br>The affirmative's rosy ROI calculations ignore the racialized reality of student debt. Black graduates default at twice the rate of white peers , while first-generation students face 30% higher dropout rates . This isn't mobility—it's a wealth transfer from marginalized communities to university endowments. When 78% of students report financial stress harming their mental health , we must ask: beneficial for whom?<br><br>**2. The Shrinking Safety Net**<br>Their argument relies on a wage premium that's evaporating in real time. The FRBSF shows the premium has fallen 4 percentage points since 2000 , with computer science grads now competing with bootcamp alumni for the same $60,000 entry-level jobs . Even "safe" degrees like nursing face glut—the BLS projects 200,000 more RNs than jobs by 2026 . The degree that once guaranteed stability now offers musical chairs.<br><br>**3. The Rise of Better Models**<br>While they dismiss alternatives, IBM's 55% skills-based hiring shift  proves degrees are becoming optional. Consider:<br>- Apprenticeships like Isis Harris's pay $80,000 salaries while avoiding debt <br>- Google's certificate holders see 63% salary increases without degrees <br>- Union electricians reach $120,000 with pensions—outearning most liberal arts grads <br><br>The affirmative clings to nostalgia for a system that no longer exists. We propose something radical: trusting young adults to choose their own paths. When welding programs cost 3% of a bachelor's degree , when tech certifications take months not years, when employers increasingly value skills over sheepskin—the four-year degree isn't just less beneficial.<br><br>
