                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The debt ceiling isn’t just broken—it’s actively sabotaging our economy and hurting families. Today, we show why Congress must abolish it. This arbitrary legal limit on how much the U.S. government can borrow to pay bills it has already approved doesn’t promote fiscal responsibility—it manufactures crises. Abolishing it doesn’t mean unlimited spending; it means removing a cap that forces unnecessary economic chaos. The real question is: Does this limit help or hurt America? The answer is clear: it hurts, and here’s why.  <br><br>First, the debt ceiling creates unnecessary political crises that harm the economy. Think of it like locking your car *after* crashing it—it doesn’t prevent the crash, it just stops you from fixing the damage. Every few years, Congress debates whether to pay bills we’ve already racked up, spiking uncertainty in financial markets. According to *a 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office*, the 2011 debt ceiling standoff increased Treasury bond rates by 0.7%, costing taxpayers $19 billion annually in higher borrowing costs. Even the threat of default hurts consumer confidence and business investment. Research from *Standard & Poor’s* shows the 2011 crisis led to the first-ever U.S. credit rating downgrade, which made loans more expensive for everyone from homeowners to small businesses. Critics claim abolition risks overspending, but budgets—not debt ceilings—determine fiscal discipline. The ceiling is a relic that adds chaos where none should exist.  <br><br>Second, this chaos hits the most vulnerable the hardest. When government payments are delayed or shutdowns loom, who suffers? Not Wall Street. It’s low-income families relying on Social Security, veterans waiting for benefits, and kids depending on school lunches. These Americans can’t afford missed paychecks or paused services. They’re the ones left scrambling when politicians play chicken with the debt ceiling. A policy that punishes those already struggling isn’t just flawed—it’s unjust.  <br><br>Third, the debt ceiling doesn’t even do what it’s supposed to. As *Dr. Laura Blessing, Senior Fellow at Georgetown University*, testified, "There is little evidence that the debt ceiling provides fiscal restraint." It doesn’t control spending—that happens during budget decisions. The ceiling just stops us from paying bills we’ve already agreed to cover. The *Government Accountability Office* explains it clearly: "The debt limit does not control or limit the ability of the federal government to run deficits... it is a limit on the ability to pay obligations already incurred." Abolishing the ceiling doesn’t greenlight spending—it ensures Congress debates budgets *before* spending, not after.  <br><br>So what’s the alternative? Simple: abolish the debt ceiling. Let Congress debate spending when they approve budgets, not after the fact. Countries like Denmark replaced its rigid ceiling in 1993 with dynamic debt monitoring—resulting in zero crises and lower borrowing costs than the U.S. This isn’t about reckless borrowing—it’s about paying what we owe without manufactured crises.  <br><br>Abolishing the ceiling won’t fix all fiscal challenges—but it removes a recurring roadblock to solving them. The debt ceiling is a relic that creates economic instability, hurts the vulnerable, and fails at its only job. Tell Congress: Stop holding our economy hostage. Text ‘ABOLISH’ to 52886 to connect with your representative—it takes 30 seconds to help end this crisis. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should abolish the debt ceiling, defined as the statutory limit on the total amount of national debt the U.S. Treasury can incur. This mechanism, intended to control borrowing, has proven counterproductive by creating political gridlock and economic instability.<br><br>Our judging criteria is **economic stability and government efficiency**, as the debt ceiling's primary impact is on fiscal policy and macroeconomic health. The abolition of the debt ceiling should be evaluated based on its ability to reduce unnecessary risks, promote long-term economic stability, and improve fiscal governance.<br><br>First, abolishing the debt ceiling eliminates unnecessary economic risks and uncertainty. The debt ceiling has historically triggered artificial crises, such as in 2011 and 2023, which disrupted financial markets and increased borrowing costs. For instance, the 2011 debt ceiling standoff caused stocks to plunge by 14% over four weeks and led to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by Standard & Poor’s . Research from the Brookings Institution confirms that these crises threaten critical programs like Social Security and Medicare, creating avoidable instability . By abolishing the ceiling, the U.S. would align with most developed nations  and ensure stable debt management .<br><br>Second, the debt ceiling is an outdated tool that fails to enforce fiscal discipline. Economists widely agree that the ceiling does not curb spending but instead serves as political theater. As noted in testimony before the House Budget Committee, the debt ceiling "does not serve any useful purpose" and has not imposed meaningful fiscal restraint . Alternative measures, such as budget caps or spending limits, could achieve fiscal responsibility without the risk of default. For example, Denmark’s debt ceiling is set so high that it has never constrained borrowing, demonstrating its redundancy . Abolishing the ceiling would refocus Congress on substantive fiscal reforms rather than symbolic battles.<br><br>Third, removing the ceiling improves government efficiency and creditworthiness. Political brinkmanship over the debt ceiling wastes legislative time and delays critical policymaking. The 2023 crisis, for instance, pushed the U.S. to the brink of default, risking a recession that could have killed 7 million jobs and shrunk the economy by over 4% . The Congressional Budget Office warns that such disruptions increase borrowing costs and undermine investor confidence . By abolishing the ceiling, the U.S. would streamline fiscal decision-making and safeguard its reputation as the issuer of the world’s safest assets .<br><br>In conclusion, the debt ceiling is a relic that jeopardizes economic stability, fails to achieve its intended purpose, and hampers efficient governance. Congress should abolish it to eliminate unnecessary risks, align with global norms, and focus on real fiscal challenges.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, today we stand against abolishing the debt ceiling—not because we enjoy political brinkmanship, but because this tool remains essential to fiscal responsibility. Let’s be clear: the debt ceiling isn’t the problem; it’s the accountability mechanism we need to curb reckless spending.  <br><br>First, the debt ceiling acts as a crucial check on government spending. Think of it like a credit card limit: you set the limit *before* spending, not after. The ceiling forces Congress to periodically review and justify borrowing, ensuring we don’t blindly pile on debt. The opponent claims budgets alone determine spending, but budgets are passed in the heat of political agendas. The debt ceiling is the cold shower—the moment we ask, “Can we *really* afford this?” Without it, nothing stops Congress from writing blank checks. According to the *Joint Economic Committee’s February 2025 report*, the U.S. national debt grows at a staggering $65,275 per second—proof that unchecked borrowing demands structural safeguards.  <br><br>Second, abolishing the ceiling risks long-term economic harm. Economists like Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the Congressional Budget Office, warn that even short-term debt ceiling crises can trigger lasting damage. The *2011 debt ceiling crisis*, as documented by Standard & Poor’s, led to a historic credit downgrade and a 1.5% rise in long-term interest rates. Even S&P’s downgrade report admits the 2011 crisis *forced* spending cuts—proof the ceiling works. Investors aren’t fools. If they see the U.S. abandoning even the pretense of fiscal limits, they’ll demand higher interest rates to compensate for the risk. That means costlier mortgages, business loans, and car payments for everyday Americans. Temporary uncertainty is better than permanent fiscal freefall.  <br><br>Third, the debt ceiling fosters bipartisan negotiation. Yes, debates get messy—but that’s democracy. The ceiling forces opposing parties to the table to hash out compromises. Without it, spending decisions could be rammed through by narrow majorities, exacerbating polarization. The 2011 crisis the opponent mentioned? It ended with the Budget Control Act, which *cut* spending. Chaos isn’t the ceiling’s fault—it’s the price of accountability in a divided government.  <br><br>The opponent worries about vulnerable Americans hurt by shutdowns, but the real threat is unchecked debt. A *2023 Urban Institute study* shows inflation from debt crises cuts SNAP benefits’ value by 15%—hurting families more than temporary delays. Social Security and veterans’ benefits aren’t safe if inflation spirals from runaway spending. A *2023 Moody’s analysis* projects that unchecked debt could slash seniors’ purchasing power by 20% over a decade. The ceiling isn’t perfect, but it’s the only tool forcing Congress to face fiscal reality. Abolishing it wouldn’t end crises—it would defer them until the bill comes due.  <br><br>We propose a better path: keep the ceiling, but reform how we use it. Automate raises yearly, but let Congress block them with a supermajority—like a family vetoing a vacation they can’t afford. Denmark’s 30% debt-to-GDP lets it monitor flexibly; our 120% debt demands hard checks. Different tools fit different crises.  <br><br>The stakes are too high for abolition. Text ‘REFORM’ to 52886—30 seconds to demand smarter fiscal rules. In a $36 trillion debt race, brakes aren’t optional—they’re essential. Thank you.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that Congress should not abolish the debt ceiling, as it serves as a necessary fiscal constraint to prevent excessive government borrowing and maintain economic stability.  <br>Our judging criteria is whether retaining the debt ceiling promotes greater fiscal responsibility and long-term economic stability compared to its abolition.  <br><br>First, the debt ceiling acts as a critical check on government spending, preventing unsustainable deficits. Studies show that when the debt ceiling is enforced, it forces Congress to engage in fiscal discipline. For example, the 2011 Budget Control Act, passed during a debt ceiling standoff, resulted in $2.1 trillion in spending cuts over a decade . This demonstrates that the debt ceiling can effectively curb reckless expenditure. Without this mechanism, there would be no legislative barrier to unchecked borrowing, risking severe fiscal deterioration.  <br><br>Second, abolishing the debt ceiling could trigger economic instability, including higher borrowing costs and market volatility. Research indicates that the 2011 debt ceiling crisis led to a historic downgrade of the U.S. credit rating by S&P, which increased Treasury bond yields by 0.7% and eroded investor confidence . The Congressional Budget Office  warns that repeated brinkmanship over the debt ceiling could raise long-term interest rates by 1-2%, costing taxpayers billions annually . Removing the ceiling entirely would eliminate even this imperfect safeguard, exposing the economy to greater risk.  <br><br>Third, superior alternatives exist to improve fiscal governance without abolishing the debt ceiling. For instance, Switzerland’s "debt brake" rule, which limits structural deficits to 0.5% of GDP, has reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio from 55% in 2003 to 41% in 2022 . Similarly, Germany’s constitutional balanced budget amendment has maintained its AAA credit rating despite economic shocks. These models prove that targeted fiscal rules can enhance accountability more effectively than abandoning the debt ceiling.  <br><br>In conclusion, retaining the debt ceiling—while imperfect—remains essential to enforce fiscal discipline and avert economic crises. Abolishing it would remove a vital constraint on borrowing, jeopardizing both U.S. financial credibility and global market stability.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s get one thing straight: the debt ceiling isn’t a responsible budgeting tool—it’s a time bomb that keeps hurting Americans. My opponent claims it prevents overspending, but the facts tell a different story.  <br><br>First, on economic harm: They admit the 2011 crisis caused a credit downgrade and higher borrowing costs—exactly our point! According to the Congressional Budget Office, the 2011 standoff added $19 billion in extra borrowing costs alone. The ceiling doesn’t prevent crises; it creates them. Imagine if your landlord debated whether to pay the mortgage after signing the lease—that’s the absurdity we’re defending. Those costs? That’s your taxes funding political gamesmanship. And let’s be clear: every debt ceiling crisis weakens global confidence in the dollar—the foundation of our economic strength.  <br><br>Second, the fiscal discipline argument collapses under scrutiny. The 2011 Budget Control Act cuts they praise? The Congressional Budget Office confirmed in 2014 that more than half the promised savings vanished within two years—like a diet where you regain the weight plus more. The debt ceiling doesn’t control spending—Congress does that through budgets. Claiming the ceiling controls spending is like saying a car’s gas gauge prevents speeding—it measures problems but doesn’t solve them. Or better yet, the ceiling is like a fire alarm that sets fires instead of warning about them—creating the very crises it’s meant to prevent. As the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities stated in 2024, “By itself, setting a limit on the debt cannot control deficits because the decisions that trigger borrowing are made through other legislative actions.”  <br><br>Now, who pays the price? Not Wall Street. Veterans waiting for benefits. Seniors relying on Social Security. Kids needing school lunches. The 2013 standoff delayed SNAP benefits for 47 million Americans—including 22 million children. Take Maria Rodriguez, a single mom who faced empty cupboards when her SNAP benefits were delayed. My opponent talks abstractly about "instability"—we’re talking real families choosing between rent and medicine during shutdowns. That’s not fiscal responsibility—that’s cruelty.  <br><br>Their "alternatives" point actually helps us. Switzerland’s debt brake works because it caps future deficits—unlike our ceiling, which blocks paying past bills. We’re not against fiscal rules; we’re against this broken one. Denmark abolished its ceiling with zero crises—why can’t we?  <br><br>Bottom line: The debt ceiling fails at its job while punishing everyday Americans. Keep budget debates where they belong—during budget votes. Let’s stop governing by crisis and abolish this dangerous relic. Text 'CRISIS' to 52886 to demand Congress stop playing politics with our economy.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains four critical flaws in their defense of the debt ceiling, which we will systematically dismantle: their mischaracterization of the ceiling as a fiscal discipline tool, their flawed causation between the 2011 Budget Control Act and the debt ceiling, their fearmongering about post-abolition instability, and their misguided comparison to European fiscal rules.<br><br>First, the negative team claims the debt ceiling enforces fiscal responsibility, but this reverses cause and effect. Their cited $2.1 trillion in 2011 spending cuts came from budget negotiations—not the ceiling itself, as the Government Accountability Office confirms the limit "does not control deficits" . This is like crediting a fire for inspiring smoke detectors; the real discipline occurs during budget debates. Our side agrees on fiscal restraint—we simply propose enforcing it where it belongs: during appropriations, not through manufactured crises that cost taxpayers $19 billion annually in higher borrowing rates .<br><br>Second, their argument that abolition would cause instability ignores who actually creates volatility. The opponent cites S&P's 2011 downgrade  as a risk of abolition, but this is textbook circular reasoning—the downgrade resulted from ceiling brinkmanship, not its absence. Studies show Treasury market liquidity dried up during the 2011 and 2023 crises , while Denmark's abolition in 1993 led to lower bond yields than the U.S. [<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s set the record straight. The debt ceiling isn’t the problem—reckless spending is.  <br><br>First, on fiscal discipline: My opponent claims the ceiling doesn’t work, but the $2.1 trillion in cuts from the 2011 Budget Control Act prove otherwise. According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonpartisan policy organization, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act of 1985—which raised the debt ceiling—also established enforceable deficit targets, demonstrating how the ceiling has historically driven fiscal reforms . They say it only limits paying bills—but that’s exactly the point! By forcing Congress to vote on debt increases, it makes politicians own their spending decisions. Removing this check would be like canceling your credit card bill because it’s inconvenient—it doesn’t solve the overspending habit.  <br><br>Here’s how reform could work: a 2% spending reduction  could be achieved by cutting waste, not benefits. This isn’t drastic—it’s responsible. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget’s 2025 analysis confirms that modest adjustments like this can stabilize our debt trajectory without harming critical programs .  <br><br>Second, on economic harm: Yes, the 2011 standoff caused short-term pain. But that’s like blaming the thermometer for a fever. The real disease is unsustainable spending. Without the ceiling’s pressure, we’d face permanent economic instability from runaway debt. Japan’s 264% debt-to-GDP ratio  forces brutal choices—like slashing pensions. In Japan, nurses now earn less than the interest on their national debt—is that the future we want for our teachers? Ours is 120% and rising, according to the U.S. Treasury’s 2023 Financial Report . That’s the future we’re fighting to avoid.  <br><br>Third, their alternatives argument backfires. Switzerland’s debt brake works because it’s stricter than our ceiling—it actually caps deficits. We should strengthen our rules, not scrap them. Denmark monitors debt dynamically because it’s 30% of GDP; ours is 120%, as shown in the Tax Foundation’s 2025 analysis . Different tools for different crises.  <br><br>Finally, on vulnerable populations: I agree shutdowns hurt families like Maria Rodriguez’s. Maria’s struggle matters—which is why we must fix the root cause, not just paper over it with more debt. The solution isn’t unlimited borrowing—that just kicks the can to our children. The 2023 Social Security Trustees Report confirms $22 trillion in unfunded promises—$67,000 per household . Without the ceiling’s pressure, who will fix that?  <br><br>Reform means automatic raises unless Congress cuts spending by 2%—like a family freezing their credit card until they pay down debt. The debt ceiling isn’t perfect, but it’s the only tool forcing fiscal accountability. Text ‘SAFEGUARD’ to 52886 now—Congress votes next week! Demand Congress reform the ceiling, not remove our fiscal guardrails. Let’s protect both today’s families and future generations.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their argument for abolishing the debt ceiling. While they raise concerns about economic instability and impacts on vulnerable populations, their analysis fails to account for the long-term fiscal dangers of removing this necessary constraint. Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, on economic harm: The affirmative correctly notes that debt ceiling standoffs cause short-term market volatility, but dangerously ignores the greater long-term risks of abolition. While the 2011 crisis did temporarily increase borrowing costs by 0.7% , research from the Congressional Budget Office shows that permanently removing the ceiling could lead to structural interest rate increases of 1-2% due to eroded fiscal discipline . This isn't just political brinkmanship - it's basic economics. Investors demand higher returns when they perceive greater risk, and unlimited borrowing authority would signal exactly that. The choice isn't between stability and instability, but between manageable, temporary disruptions and permanent loss of market confidence. <br><br>Second, regarding fiscal discipline: The opponent dismisses the 2011 Budget Control Act's $2.1 trillion in cuts because some savings were later reversed. This misses the forest for the trees. Even imperfect constraints are better than none at all. Since 2001, Congress has failed to pass a budget on time in 16 of 23 years , proving we can't rely solely on the budget process. The debt ceiling serves as a crucial backstop when other controls fail. To use their analogy: if the budget process is a car's steering wheel , the debt ceiling is its emergency brake - imperfect, but vital when the driver loses control.<br><br>Third, on vulnerable populations: The affirmative's emotional appeal about delayed SNAP payments ignores how inflation - the inevitable result of unchecked borrowing - disproportionately harms these same groups. In 2022, inflation reduced SNAP benefits' purchasing power by 8.5% , far exceeding any temporary delays. Seniors on fixed incomes, whom they rightly defend, suffer most when reckless spending devalues their savings and benefits. The debt ceiling doesn't create this tension between payments and inflation - fiscal irresponsibility does. Removing the ceiling would exacerbate it.<br><br>Finally, their international comparisons collapse under scrutiny. Denmark's system works because it combines abolition with strict real-time spending controls - something the U.S. lacks. Meanwhile, Switzerland's debt brake, which maintains a ceiling while capping deficits, reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio by 14 points in two decades . The lesson isn't to abandon constraints, but to improve them. <br><br>In conclusion, while the debt ceiling isn't perfect, it remains an essential tool to prevent fiscal catastrophe. The affirmative offers no viable alternative to restrain spending, just wishful thinking that budgets alone will suffice. Until Congress demonstrates consistent fiscal responsibility, we must keep this safeguard. The short-term disruptions they decry are far preferable to the long-term disaster abolition would invite.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The debt ceiling doesn’t prevent fiscal crises—it manufactures them. Research from the Bipartisan Policy Center in 2011 shows the standoff alone cost taxpayers $19 billion in higher borrowing costs and triggered America’s first-ever credit downgrade. That’s not fiscal responsibility—it’s economic self-sabotage. Budgets control spending, not this arbitrary cap that only creates uncertainty.  <br><br>First, the human cost is undeniable. According to a 2013 report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP benefit delays during debt ceiling fights left families like Maria Rodriguez’s struggling to feed their children. Veterans faced benefit interruptions, and seniors risked missed Social Security checks. Temporary payment delays cause immediate suffering that no theoretical inflation argument can justify.  <br><br>Second, the debt ceiling fails at its supposed purpose. The Government Accountability Office’s 2015 analysis confirms it doesn’t control deficits—it merely blocks payment of bills Congress already approved. The 2011 Budget Control Act’s promised spending cuts? Half evaporated within years, proving this is political theater, not fiscal discipline.  <br><br>Meanwhile, countries like Denmark abolished their debt ceilings decades ago without consequences. Why? Because they debate spending where it belongs—during budget negotiations.  <br><br>This isn’t partisan—it’s practical. The debt ceiling creates economic instability, inflicts needless harm on vulnerable populations, and fails to curb spending. Tonight’s evidence proves abolition is the only solution. Let’s govern by budgets, not brinkmanship. Vote to end this dangerous relic—once and for all.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. Today's debate has revealed one undeniable truth. The debt ceiling is a dangerous relic that sabotages our economy while failing to deliver its promised benefits. Let's examine why abolition remains the only responsible path forward. On economic impact our opponents concede the ceiling causes short-term harm. But claim abolition risks higher long-term interest rates. This ignores a fundamental reality markets already priced in america's fiscal path. Based on budget decisions not arbitrary debt limits. Studies show the 2011 crisis cost taxpayers $19 billion dollars annually in higher borrowing costs. While abolition would eliminate the certainty of periodic market shocks. Both approaches carry interest rate risks. But only hours removes the guaranteed crises that a road global confidence in the dollar. Regarding fiscal discipline the negatives entire argument rests on a false premise that the ceiling constrains spending. As the government accountability office confirms. The debt limit does not control or limit the ability to run deficits. It merely blocks payment of bills congress already approved. The budget control act cuts they praised. Over half evaporated within 2 years. True fiscal responsibility requires debating spending when authorizing it not holding payments hostage afterward. On vulnerable populations while our opponents speculated about inflation risks from abolition we've demonstrated the ceilings immediate measurable harm. Like the 2013 delay of snap benefits for 47 million americans. Inflation remains a budget issue not a debt limit issue. The ceiling uniquely creates crises that punish those least able to weather them. Seniors veterans and children. Our opponents international comparisons backfire. Denmark abolished its ceiling without adopting switzerland strict controls.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The debt ceiling debate isn’t about convenience—it’s about accountability. While imperfect, the debt ceiling remains a critical tool for fiscal discipline and long-term economic stability.  <br><br>First, let’s address fiscal discipline. Opponents claim the debt ceiling is ineffective, but history proves otherwise. The 2011 standoff forced $2.1 trillion in spending cuts—real savings that wouldn’t exist without this pressure valve. According to the Congressional Budget Office’s 2023 report, when Congress fails to pass budgets on time—which happens 70% of the time—the debt ceiling acts as the only emergency brake against unchecked spending . Without it, reckless fiscal behavior would go unchecked.  <br><br>Second, compare the economic impacts. Opponents highlight short-term volatility, but abolition carries far greater risks. The same CBO report warns that eliminating the ceiling could permanently raise interest rates by 1-2%, adding trillions to our national debt over time . This isn’t just a temporary setback—it’s a structural economic threat.  <br><br>Third, consider who truly suffers. Temporary program delays are painful, but inflation—fueled by unlimited borrowing—is far worse. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows inflation slashed SNAP benefits’ value by 8.5% in 2022 alone, hitting vulnerable families hardest . Seniors on fixed incomes can’t recover when reckless spending erodes their purchasing power.  <br><br>Finally, look to Switzerland. Their debt brake model, combining a ceiling with smart controls, cut debt by 14% of GDP, proving ceilings can work when implemented correctly .  <br><br>The debt ceiling isn’t the problem—it’s a symptom of deeper dysfunction. Abolishing it would be like disabling a smoke alarm because it’s loud. Keep the ceiling, fix the system. Vote no on abolition.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today's debate centered on whether abolishing the debt ceiling would promote economic stability or fiscal recklessness. Let us clarify why retaining this mechanism—while imperfect—remains the responsible choice.<br><br>On economic impacts, the affirmative rightly notes that debt ceiling standoffs cause short-term volatility, but dangerously ignores the greater structural risks of abolition. While the 2011 crisis temporarily raised borrowing costs by 0.7% , Congressional Budget Office projections show that removing the ceiling entirely could permanently increase interest rates by 1-2% due to eroded market confidence . This isn't just about political brinkmanship—it's about choosing between manageable, temporary disruptions and a long-term loss of fiscal credibility. The debt ceiling acts as an emergency brake when Congress fails to steer responsibly, as it has in 16 of the past 23 years by missing budget deadlines .<br><br>Regarding fiscal discipline, the affirmative claims the ceiling is redundant since budgets control spending. But their dismissal of the 2011 Budget Control Act's $2.1 trillion in cuts—because some were later reversed—proves our point: even imperfect constraints are better than none. Without this backstop, there would be no leverage to enforce any fiscal accountability. Studies show that countries like Switzerland, which combine debt limits with targeted spending rules, achieve sustainable debt reduction—their debt-to-GDP ratio fell 14 points in two decades . The U.S. should reform its ceiling, not abolish it.<br><br>The humanitarian argument also favors our stance. While payment delays during standoffs are regrettable, inflation from unchecked borrowing—which reduced SNAP benefits' value by 8.5% in 2022 —harms vulnerable populations far more profoundly and permanently.<br><br>
