                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency , defined as a digital form of the U.S. dollar issued and regulated by the Federal Reserve, designed to enhance financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and economic competitiveness while maintaining monetary sovereignty.  <br>Our judging criteria is whether a U.S. CBDC demonstrably improves economic efficiency, expands financial access to underserved populations, and strengthens the dollar’s global position relative to emerging digital alternatives.  <br><br>First, a U.S. CBDC would significantly enhance financial inclusion by providing banking access to the unbanked. Studies show that 5.9 million U.S. households lack bank accounts, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority communities . A CBDC accessible via mobile devices—like Nigeria’s eNaira, which onboarded 8 million users within a year—could eliminate barriers to financial services, reducing reliance on costly alternatives like payday lenders . Research by the World Economic Forum confirms that digital currencies can improve gender equality and health outcomes by integrating marginalized groups into the formal economy . This demonstrates that a CBDC is not merely a technological upgrade but a tool for equitable economic participation.  <br><br>Second, CBDCs would modernize payment systems, slashing transaction costs and delays. Cross-border payments currently take 3–5 days with fees averaging 6.5% of the transfer amount . The Federal Reserve’s Project Hamilton prototype confirmed that a digital dollar could settle transactions in under two seconds at near-zero cost . IBM estimates that such efficiency gains could save U.S. businesses $120 billion annually by reducing intermediary fees and fraud . Unlike cryptocurrencies, a Fed-backed CBDC would combine speed with regulatory compliance, as seen in the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar, which cut payment processing costs by 40% . This evidence underscores CBDCs’ potential to streamline commerce domestically and internationally.  <br><br>Third, a digital dollar is critical to maintaining U.S. monetary sovereignty amid geopolitical shifts. China’s digital yuan  already processes $250 billion in transactions annually and is being adopted in Belt and Road Initiative trade deals, challenging dollar dominance . The Atlantic Council warns that without a CBDC, the U.S. risks ceding financial infrastructure control to rivals . Conversely, a digital dollar would preserve the greenback’s reserve currency status by offering a secure, interoperable alternative for global trade, as advocated by the Bank for International Settlements .  <br><br>In conclusion, a U.S. CBDC is a necessary evolution to promote financial inclusion, optimize payments, and defend economic leadership. The Federal Reserve’s own research and global precedents confirm its feasibility and benefits.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine if sending money was as fast as sending a text message—no more waiting days for checks to clear or paying high fees for wire transfers. That’s the promise of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Today, I’ll prove why the U.S. must adopt this innovation, focusing on three undeniable benefits: speed, stability, and inclusivity.  <br><br>First, let’s define a CBDC. It’s not cryptocurrency like Bitcoin; it’s a digital version of the U.S. dollar, issued and backed by the Federal Reserve. Think of it as upgrading from paper money to a secure, government-backed digital wallet. Countries like China and the Bahamas have already launched their own CBDCs, with the Bahamas’ "Sand Dollar" helping hurricane survivors access aid without bank accounts—proving this isn’t just theoretical but a real-world solution.  <br><br>Now, how do we judge whether a CBDC is worth implementing? The criteria are clear: Does it make transactions faster? Does it strengthen financial stability? And does it include marginalized communities? The answer to all three is a resounding yes.  <br><br>Let’s start with speed. Research from *Ripple in 2023* shows CBDCs can settle transactions in seconds, compared to days for traditional banking. Picture paying rent or splitting a dinner bill instantly, without intermediaries skimming fees or causing delays. According to *a 2023 study in ScienceDirect*, CBDCs also reduce errors by eliminating manual processing, a game-changer for small businesses and workers who can’t afford inefficiencies.  <br><br>Next, stability. Bank runs—like those during the 2008 crisis—can devastate economies. But a *2022 study published in ScienceDirect* by MIT economists confirms CBDCs reduce this risk by 6.1%, acting as a financial safety net. To put this in perspective, this reduction is like preventing another 2008 crisis every 20 years. Because CBDCs are government-backed, people won’t panic-withdraw cash during crises. Sweden’s e-krona model demonstrates how transparency and security can balance privacy concerns while calming markets.  <br><br>Critics raise privacy concerns, but Sweden’s model proves security and transparency can coexist. The real risk? Falling behind. The IMF found in 2023 that CBDCs could cut transaction costs by 80%, and nations like China are already leading this revolution.  <br><br>Finally, inclusivity. Over 28% of banks in developed countries are inaccessible to people with disabilities, as reported by the *UN in 2018*. A well-designed CBDC can change this. For example, the *Bank of Canada’s 2023 research* highlights features like voice commands and screen readers, ensuring everyone—regardless of ability—can participate in the economy. This isn’t just technology; it’s justice. And let’s not forget the U.S. context: In Appalachia, where 1 in 5 lack bank access, a CBDC could be a lifeline, bridging the gap for communities left behind by traditional banking.  <br><br>To sum up: A U.S. CBDC means instant payments, a crisis-proof financial system, and equal access for all. Every day without a CBDC, small businesses lose $2 million in fees—act now. The future of money is here—contact your representatives to support the Digital Dollar Project’s 2024 pilot program. Let’s build a system that works for everyone, starting today.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency . A CBDC is a digital form of a country's fiat currency issued and regulated by the central bank, designed to function as legal tender. Unlike cryptocurrencies, CBDCs are centralized and government-controlled . <br><br>Our judging criteria is whether implementing a CBDC would undermine financial privacy, stability, and democratic values more than it would benefit the economy. This standard prioritizes individual freedoms, systemic resilience, and the existence of superior alternatives.<br><br>First, CBDCs enable unprecedented government surveillance, eroding privacy rights. The centralized nature of CBDCs allows governments to monitor transactions in real-time without judicial oversight, creating potential for abuse. Studies show that 63% of financial professionals are concerned about data privacy with CBDCs . Research indicates that China's digital yuan has already been used to track and freeze the accounts of political dissidents, demonstrating how CBDCs can become tools of financial surveillance . This level of monitoring violates the Fourth Amendment's reasonable expectation of privacy in the US context.<br><br>Second, CBDCs threaten financial stability by disrupting the traditional banking system. When depositors can move funds directly to central bank accounts, commercial banks lose their deposit base needed for lending. The Federal Reserve estimates that even with holding limits, CBDCs could reduce bank deposits by 20-40%, potentially triggering credit crunches . This was evident in the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse, where rapid digital withdrawals exacerbated the crisis. The International Monetary Fund warns that widespread CBDC adoption could increase banks' reliance on volatile wholesale funding, making the financial system more fragile .<br><br>Third, superior alternatives to CBDCs already exist without their risks. The FedNow instant payment system processed over $70 billion in transactions in its first year without compromising privacy or financial stability . Private sector innovations like regulated stablecoins  offer digital payment efficiency while maintaining competition in the monetary system. As Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller noted, "FedNow provides many of the benefits touted for CBDCs without the potential downsides" . Economic theory from Friedrich Hayek supports this approach, arguing that denationalized currencies foster innovation better than government monopolies .<br><br>In conclusion, the risks of CBDCs - including privacy erosion, financial instability, and government overreach - far outweigh their potential benefits. The US already has effective digital payment alternatives that preserve financial freedom and innovation without centralizing monetary power.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, while the idea of a central bank digital currency might sound modern, the reality is far riskier than our opponents admit. Today, we’ll prove why a U.S. CBDC threatens privacy, creates instability, and fails to justify its costs—backed by concrete evidence and expert analysis.  <br><br>First, a CBDC would give the government unprecedented control over your money. According to a 2023 study in *Privacy Implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies* by Harvard Law School researchers, a centralized CBDC model enables mass surveillance, cybersecurity risks, and potential data misuse by authorities. Imagine every transaction—your coffee, medical bills, even donations—tracked in real-time by the Federal Reserve. This isn’t just a digital dollar; it’s a financial panopticon. Unlike private banks or cash, a CBDC could allow freezing accounts or penalizing disfavored purchases. China’s digital yuan already blocks transactions for "social credit" violations, as documented by *The Wall Street Journal* in 2023. Should the U.S. follow that path? Privacy isn’t about hiding—it’s about freedom from surveillance.  <br><br>Second, cyber risks make CBDCs a ticking time bomb. A 2024 IMF report on cyber threats revealed that attacks on payment systems, like the 2023 ransomware strike that crippled 60 U.S. credit unions, demonstrate how centralized systems amplify vulnerabilities. The Bahamas’ Sand Dollar suffered outages during hurricanes—proof that digital systems fail when we need them most. Research by economist Kevin Dowd, published in the *Journal of Financial Stability* in 2024, highlights how single points of failure—where one hack can crash the whole system—collapsed Jamaica’s DCash. Cash doesn’t crash during power outages or cyberattacks. Why replace resilience with vulnerability?  <br><br>Third, the costs outweigh the benefits. The Federal Reserve estimates developing a CBDC could take a decade and billions of dollars. Meanwhile, private solutions like Zelle and Venmo already provide instant payments. For the unbanked, expanding postal banking—which reaches rural areas at 1/10th the cost of CBDC infrastructure, per the *American Economic Liberties Project*—is cheaper and safer. Nigeria’s eNaira saw over 50% of users abandon it within months due to technical glitches, as reported by *The Financial Times* in 2024.  <br><br>Our opponents claim CBDCs will protect the dollar’s dominance. But the dollar is strong because of trust, not technology. A 2021 *ScienceDirect* study of 40 economies found CBDCs could reduce bank deposits by 20%, risking credit shortages. China’s digital yuan hasn’t dented the dollar’s 60% share in global trade. The real threat isn’t falling behind—it’s rushing into a system that sacrifices liberty for speed.  <br><br>Finally, let’s address financial inclusion. Postal banking and low-fee accounts, as advocated by experts at the *American Economic Liberties Project*, offer proven alternatives without CBDC risks. A 2024 study in *Digital Money Trends*, an IMF-affiliated publication, found that 65% of financial institutions prefer stablecoins or tokenized deposits—digital bank IOUs that avoid centralization risks—over CBDCs for liquidity needs.  <br><br>In conclusion, a CBDC solves problems we don’t have with risks we can’t afford. Urge your representatives to cosponsor the *CBDC Anti-Surveillance State Act*—find their contact at USA.gov. The American economy deserves better. Thank you.  <br><br>**<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their assessment of a U.S. CBDC, particularly regarding privacy protections, cybersecurity risks, cost-benefit analysis, and global competitiveness. We will systematically address each of these misconceptions while reinforcing why a digital dollar remains essential for financial inclusion, payment modernization, and maintaining U.S. economic leadership.<br><br>**First**, the negative team's portrayal of CBDCs as an inevitable surveillance tool misrepresents both technical realities and U.S. legal safeguards. While they cite China's social credit system as a cautionary tale, this ignores fundamental differences in democratic governance. The Federal Reserve's 2022 research explicitly proposes tiered privacy protections, where small transactions would remain anonymous while larger ones comply with existing anti-money laundering laws . This balanced approach mirrors the ECB's "anonymity vouchers" system  and is far stricter than private payment apps like Venmo—which the negative praises—yet routinely sells transaction data to third parties . Privacy isn't a binary choice between cash and surveillance; a well-designed CBDC can offer auditability for illicit activity while preserving everyday financial freedom.<br><br>**Second**, their cybersecurity warnings rely on selective examples while ignoring the Federal Reserve's unparalleled security infrastructure. Yes, the Bahamas' Sand Dollar faced outages during hurricanes—but so did cash-based systems when ATMs lost power. Meanwhile, Project Hamilton's stress tests demonstrated the U.S. CBDC prototype could process 1.7 million transactions per second with military-grade encryption , outperforming Visa's network. The IMF's 2024 data actually shows commercial banks suffer 300% more cyberattacks than central banks , proving decentralization isn't inherently safer. By consolidating defenses under the Fed's cybersecurity umbrella, a digital dollar would reduce—not increase—systemic risks.<br><br>**Third**, their cost objections crumble under scrutiny. While they cite Nigeria's eNaira "abandonment," the program still onboarded 4 million unbanked Nigerians—equivalent to a decade of progress under their proposed postal banking alternative at equivalent costs . Moreover, IBM's estimate of $120 billion in annual savings from payment efficiency  dwarfs initial development costs. As for financial stability, their cited *ScienceDirect* study on deposit reductions fails to account for the Federal Reserve's ability to adjust reserve requirements—a tool already used to manage liquidity risks .<br><br>**Fourth**, their dismissal of geopolitical stakes reveals a dangerous complacency. While the dollar remains dominant today, China's e-CNY is already mandatory for Belt and Road Initiative transactions, processing $250 billion annually . The Atlantic Council warns that without a digital dollar, the U.S. risks ceding control over financial standards to authoritarian regimes . Stablecoins—the negative's preferred alternative—lack sovereign backing and collapsed spectacularly in cases like TerraUSD, whereas a Fed-issued CBDC would combine private-sector innovation with public-sector stability.<br><br>In conclusion, the negative's arguments rely on fearmongering and false dichotomies. A U.S. CBDC can enhance privacy relative to current digital payments, harden cybersecurity, deliver long-term economic gains, and preserve monetary sovereignty—all while bringing millions into the financial system. The real risk isn't innovation; it's stagnation while our competitors race ahead.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s address these concerns head-on with evidence-backed clarity.  <br><br>First, on privacy: Our opponents rightly worry about surveillance, but this conflates design with intent. China’s social credit system reflects its authoritarianism—not CBDC technology. According to a 2024 study published in *Privacy Implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies*, privacy-by-design safeguards like pseudonymous wallets and zero-knowledge proofs—a method to verify transactions without revealing personal data—can prevent overreach, as Sweden’s Riksbank is already testing. Cash isn’t truly anonymous either—ATMs track withdrawals, and banks report large transactions under existing laws. A well-designed CBDC, as recommended by the Bank for International Settlements in 2023, could enhance privacy for small transactions while maintaining anti-fraud safeguards.  <br><br>Second, cybersecurity: Yes, centralized systems face risks—but so do decentralized ones. Crypto exchanges lost $3.8 billion to hacks in 2022 alone—enough to buy 76,000 median-priced U.S. homes. The Federal Reserve, per its 2023 annual report, already secures $5 trillion daily in wire transfers without systemic collapses. Outages in the Bahamas occurred precisely because they rushed implementation, not because CBDCs are inherently flawed. Research from the European Central Bank in 2022 confirms that redundancy measures, like offline functionality in the EU’s digital euro prototype, can mitigate these risks.  <br><br>Third, costs: Developing a CBDC requires investment, but compare this to the $120 billion in annual savings from faster payments, as estimated by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston in 2023. Private apps like Venmo exclude 22 million underbanked Americans who lack credit scores. Postal banking helps but can’t enable instant cross-border remittances—a lifeline for immigrant families paying $12 billion yearly in fees, according to the World Bank. Nigeria’s Central Bank reported a 400% growth in active eNaira users in 2023 after initial fixes, proving scalability.  <br><br>With these safeguards in place, the question isn’t *if* we should act—it’s *why now*?  <br><br>Financial inclusion isn’t just convenience—it’s dignity. The IMF’s 2023 study on CBDCs found that unbanked households pay $3,000 yearly in check-cashing fees, a burden a U.S. digital dollar could eliminate overnight.  <br><br>Monetary sovereignty isn’t abstract. If China’s digital yuan dominates oil trades, a 2023 *ScienceDirect* analysis projects a 10% gas price rise, costing the average driver $200 yearly. Without a CBDC, the dollar’s 60% global reserve share could erode as alternative systems gain traction.  <br><br>Our opponents offer valid critiques—but not insurmountable ones. The Bank of England’s 2022 framework shows CBDCs can coexist with traditional deposits by limiting holdings, preventing credit shortages. With tiered remuneration and holding limits, a U.S. CBDC can prevent bank runs while expanding access. The real risk isn’t moving forward—it’s standing still while the world evolves. Join 50,000 Americans who’ve already urged Congress to act—email your senator to co-sponsor the Digital Dollar Act today. Let’s build a digital dollar that reflects American values: inclusive, innovative, and free.  <br><br><br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges and colleagues, while the affirmative team presents a polished case for CBDCs, their arguments crumble under scrutiny. Today, we'll expose three critical flaws in their reasoning: their privacy safeguards are illusory, their cybersecurity claims ignore systemic risks, and their cost-benefit analysis dangerously overlooks real-world failures.<br><br>First, on privacy, the affirmative claims tiered protections prevent surveillance. This is misleading. Even their own Federal Reserve source admits authorities can access transaction data with "appropriate legal process"  - a loophole big enough to drive a surveillance state through. Studies show 78% of Americans oppose government tracking of purchases , yet a CBDC would make this inevitable. China's system didn't start as a tool for oppression either - it evolved into one, as documented by Human Rights Watch . When has any government voluntarily surrendered power to monitor its citizens?<br><br>Second, their cybersecurity assurances ignore the fundamental risk of centralization. Yes, Project Hamilton processed 1.7 million transactions per second in a lab , but real-world systems face unpredictable threats. Just last month, Russian hackers breached the FDIC's systems . A CBDC wouldn't just be another database - it would be the bullseye for every hostile actor worldwide. The Bahamas' outages prove digital systems fail when most needed . Cash doesn't crash during cyberattacks or hurricanes.<br><br>Third, their cost-benefit math simply doesn't add up. They cite Nigeria's 4 million onboarded users but ignore that half abandoned the system within months due to technical failures . Postal banking serves rural communities at 10% of CBDC costs . Most damningly, their vaunted $120 billion in savings assumes perfect adoption - but Jamaica's DCash collapse shows how quickly public trust evaporates when systems fail .<br><br>The affirmative's geopolitical argument is equally flawed. The dollar dominates because America respects property rights and avoids financial surveillance - the very principles a CBDC would undermine. China's e-CNY processes $250 billion annually? That's just 1% of China's GDP  - hardly evidence of dollar displacement.<br><br>We don't need to sacrifice liberty for innovation. FedNow provides instant payments without surveillance risks. Postal banking offers inclusion without technical glitches. The American people deserve better than a solution worse than the problems it claims to solve.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s cut through the spin. First, on privacy: tiered anonymity is a Trojan horse. The Federal Reserve’s own 2022 framework admits they’ll track transactions over $600—that’s your rent, medical bills, even car payments. Once that door opens, history shows thresholds always shrink. China started with “only” monitoring large transfers too; now its digital yuan blocks subway rides for protesters, as reported by *The Wall Street Journal* in 2023. The ECB’s vouchers? Limited to €50 per month—barely a week’s groceries. And Venmo selling data? That’s a corporate problem fixable with regulation, not an excuse for state surveillance. Research from *ScienceDirect* in 2021 confirms that even with zero-knowledge proofs—a privacy tool that still leaves traceable metadata—CBDCs inherently compromise privacy, undermining true anonymity.  <br><br>Second, their cost-benefit math doesn’t add up. Nigeria’s 4 million “onboarded” eNaira users? Over half quit within months—real inclusion means sustained use, not sign-ups, according to *Central Bank of Nigeria* data from 2023. Meanwhile, Venmo and Zelle already move $1.6 trillion annually at near-zero cost, as documented by the *Federal Reserve Payments Study* in 2023. Postal banking serves 10 times more unbanked Americans than CBDCs ever could, reaching 90% of unbanked households at 1/10th the cost, per a *USPS Report* in 2024. IBM’s $120 billion savings fantasy assumes 100% adoption—yet even smartphones, after 15 years, only reach 85% penetration .  <br><br>But what about the unbanked? Our opponents ignore the real solution. On cybersecurity: centralization is the risk, not the solution. Yes, commercial banks get hacked—but when one fails, others keep working. A CBDC crash would freeze the entire economy. Project Hamilton’s “military-grade encryption” means nothing when hurricanes knock out power grids or ransomware hits Fed servers—as happened to Jamaica’s DCash, a CBDC that collapsed for months after a 2022 cyberattack. *Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency* reports from 2023 reveal Russia breached Fed systems, proving no encryption is foolproof.  <br><br>Do we need financial inclusion? Absolutely. But throwing tech at systemic poverty is like giving a starving man an iPhone. Nigeria’s eNaira didn’t teach financial literacy or create jobs—it just digitized exclusion. Postal banking plus financial education addresses root causes without CBDC risks. The *Institute of International Finance* in 2023 concluded that a U.S. CBDC would neither be sufficient nor necessary for financial inclusion.  <br><br>Finally, the dollar dominates because America is stable, not because it’s printed on paper. China’s digital yuan processes less than 1% of global trade—the real threat isn’t their tech, but our panic. Digital dollars won’t stop digital yuan any more than paper dollars stopped the euro. Let’s fix real problems: regulate predatory lenders, harden existing payment systems, and expand broadband access. Demand Congress fund postal banking under H.R. 4000 instead of CBDC experiments. Text NO-CBDC to 50409 to contact your senator and oppose this dangerous overreach. A CBDC solves nothing we can’t fix better elsewhere.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chair person and esteemed judges. Today's debate has centered on whether a us cbdc can responsibly advance financial inclusion modernize payments and safeguard monetary sovereign. All while addressing legitimate concerns about privacy security and cost. Let's clarify why are case prevails on these critical battlegrounds. On privacy. The opposition surveillance fears conflate china's authoritarian model with the us system. Unlike china the federal reserve's tiered privacy framework. Aligns with existing us laws cash like anonymity for small transactions anti-money laundering checks for larger ones this mirrors the ecb's vouchers. While private apps like venmo which the opposition endorses monetize user data without consent. The real privacy risk isn't a regulated cbdc. It's unaccountable corporate surveillance. On inclusion. While nigeria's inara faced early adoption challenges it still banked 4 million people. Equivalent to a decade of postal banking progress at comparable costs. Postal banking the valuable cannot match cbdc scalability or integration with mobile first solutions. Research shows digital currencies boost inclusion by 30% in rural areas where brick-and-mortar services lag. On security. The opposition's focus on jamaica's d cash ignores the feds unmatched cybersecurity resources. Project hamilton processed 1.7 million transactions per second with zero failures 6 outperforming private networks. Centralization isn't a weakness it enables coordinated defense against threats that fragment private systems. The imf confirms central banks suffer fewer breaches than commercial banks. On global leadership dismissing china's digital yuan is dangerously shorts. It's mandatory use in 250 billion dollars of belton road trade. A rhodes dollar dominance. A us cbdc isn't about chasing technology.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s cut through the noise: the opposition’s claims don’t hold up. Here’s why a U.S. CBDC is the right path forward.  <br><br>First, on privacy: the Federal Reserve’s 2022 whitepaper guarantees small transactions remain anonymous, mirroring cash protections while targeting illicit activity. Contrast this with private apps—*Consumer Reports* revealed in 2023 that Venmo and PayPal routinely sell user data. A U.S. CBDC doesn’t enable surveillance; it modernizes accountability while outperforming private-sector privacy failures.  <br><br>Second, financial inclusion isn’t just theoretical. Nigeria’s eNaira, launched in 2021, brought 4 million unbanked citizens into the system within months—far surpassing postal banking’s reach. The *World Bank’s 2022 report* confirms these are design challenges, not flaws in the CBDC model itself.  <br><br>Third, efficiency is critical. While Venmo handles $1.6 trillion annually, the *FDIC’s 2023 data* shows it still excludes 15% of rural users. The Fed’s 2023 prototype processes 1.7 million transactions per second—outpacing Visa, slashing fees, and reaching underserved communities by design.  <br><br>Geopolitically, *Bloomberg* reported in 2023 that China’s e-CNY has already hit $250 billion, threatening dollar dominance. Leadership demands innovation, not clinging to outdated systems.  <br><br>This isn’t about technology—it’s about values.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you chairperson and esteemed judges. Today's debate has revealed three critical battlegrounds where our opponents case for us cbdc collapses under scrutiny. Privacy cybersecurity and cost benefit trade-offs. On privacy the affirmatives claim that tiered anonymity protects freedom is dangerously naive. Their own sources admit the fed would track transactions over $600. A threshold guaranteed to shrink just as china. The wall street journal documented how beijing's digital yuan now block subway rides for protesters. The ecb's 50 euro privacy vouchers are equally illusory enough for coffee not rent. This isn't innovation its surveillance cre. Studies in science direct confirm cbdcs inherently compromised anonymity by leaving traceable metadata. If venmo's data sales are problematic regulate venmo don't replace corporate abuse with state over. On cybersecurity centralization is the flaw not the solution. The affirmative boasts about fed encryption. What's sister reports probe russia already breached fed systems. Jamaica's d cash collapsed for months after one cyber attack. Imagine that scaled to the us economy. Commercial banks get hacked too but their failures don't paralyze the entire financial system. Cash doesn't crash during power outages or ransomware. Why gamble resilience for theoretical efficiency? On costs the math is clear. Nigeria zenyara lost over half its users to glitches while postal banking serves 90% of unbanked households at 1:10 the cost for. The affirmatives 120 billion savings fantasy assumes 100% adoption yet even smartphones haven't achieved that after 15 years. Pew research 2024. Meanwhile venmo and zelle already move 1.6 trillion dollars annually without taxpayer-funded experiments 6. The affirmative geopolitical panic is equally misguided.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s confront the truth: a central bank digital currency is an unnecessary risk masquerading as progress. First, on privacy, the Fed’s so-called tiered protections are illusory. According to *Federal Reserve documentation from 2023*, transactions over $600 will be tracked—capturing everything from rent to medical bills. History proves these thresholds shrink. Look at China: what began as minor surveillance now blocks protesters from subway rides. Privacy isn’t a privilege; it’s a right we cannot compromise.  <br><br>Second, cybersecurity claims are dangerously overstated. *Research by the Bank for International Settlements in 2022* confirms centralized systems like Jamaica’s DCash collapsed for months after a single cyberattack. Meanwhile, decentralized platforms like Venmo process $1.6 trillion annually without systemic failures. Resilience isn’t optional—it’s essential.  <br><br>Third, the cost-benefit analysis collapses under scrutiny. *Data from Nigeria’s Central Bank in 2023* shows the eNaira lost half its users within months. Compare that to postal banking, which reaches 90% of unbanked households at a fraction of the cost. Private solutions like Zelle and Venmo already offer instant transfers. Why waste billions on redundancy?  <br><br>Finally, the digital yuan threat is a distraction. *The IMF reported in 2023* that it handles less than 1% of global trade. The dollar’s dominance stems from trust, not technological gimmicks.  <br><br>This isn’t innovation—it’s recklessness. A CBDC jeopardizes privacy, stability, and taxpayer dollars for negligible gains. Demand real solutions: crack down on predatory lenders, expand postal banking. Reject this dangerous gamble. The stakes demand nothing less. Vote no.
