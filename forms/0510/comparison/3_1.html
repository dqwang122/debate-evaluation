                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that the United States should implement a central bank digital currency , defined as a digital form of the U.S. dollar issued and regulated by the Federal Reserve. A CBDC would serve as a public digital payment option, complementing physical cash and commercial bank money while enhancing financial inclusion, payment efficiency, and economic competitiveness.<br><br>Our judging criteria is whether a U.S. CBDC demonstrably improves financial inclusion for unbanked populations, reduces transaction costs and settlement times, and strengthens the dollar's global position against foreign digital currencies and private stablecoins, while maintaining monetary sovereignty and security. <br><br>First, a U.S. CBDC would significantly enhance financial inclusion by providing secure, low-cost banking access to underserved populations. Currently, 5.4 million U.S. households remain unbanked . Research shows that CBDCs accessible via mobile devices, like the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, successfully reduce barriers to financial services by eliminating account minimums and physical branch requirements . Studies indicate that digital currencies can lower transaction costs by up to 80% compared to traditional remittance services, making financial services affordable for low-income households . This directly addresses systemic financial exclusion, a critical social and economic issue.<br><br>Second, implementing a CBDC would revolutionize payment efficiency by enabling near-instant, low-cost transactions. Traditional cross-border payments through intermediaries like SWIFT take 2-5 days and incur fees averaging 6.5% of the transfer amount . In contrast, China's digital yuan  processes 300,000 transactions per second with settlement times under one second . Federal Reserve research confirms that CBDCs could reduce U.S. payment system costs by $100 billion annually by eliminating intermediaries . Such efficiency gains would benefit businesses through faster cash flows and consumers through reduced remittance fees.<br><br>Third, a digital dollar is essential to maintain U.S. monetary leadership amid global CBDC competition. Over 130 countries are developing CBDCs, with China's e-CNY already being used in $12.8 billion of Belt and Road Initiative transactions . The IMF warns that without a digital dollar, the U.S. could lose up to 30% of its dollar-based trade settlement dominance to alternative systems by 2030 . A well-designed U.S. CBDC would preserve dollar hegemony while countering private stablecoins that threaten monetary policy effectiveness .<br><br>In conclusion, the evidence overwhelmingly supports implementing a U.S. CBDC to advance financial inclusion, modernize payment systems, and secure economic leadership. As 98% of central banks now research CBDCs , the United States must act decisively to shape this financial revolution rather than react to it.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a world where sending money is as instant as sending a text message. No waiting days for checks to clear, no hefty wire transfer fees—just seamless, secure transactions at the tap of a button. That’s the promise of a central bank digital currency, or CBDC: a digital dollar issued and backed by the Federal Reserve. Unlike cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, which swing wildly in value, a CBDC’s value is fixed—one digital dollar always equals one paper dollar. It’s stable, government-regulated, and designed to include everyone—from small businesses to seniors on fixed incomes. Countries like China and the Bahamas are already leading the way with their digital yuan and Sand Dollar, proving this isn’t just theory—it’s reality.  <br><br>So how should we judge whether the U.S. should adopt a CBDC? Two key tests: First, does it make our economy more efficient? Second, does it make our financial system more stable? Let’s examine both.  <br><br>First, efficiency. Today’s banking system is like using dial-up internet in a 5G world. A paycheck deposited on Friday might not clear until Tuesday. Cross-border payments can take *days* and cost absurd fees. According to *Ripple’s 2023 analysis*, CBDCs reduce transaction times by 90% compared to traditional systems, settling payments in seconds with minimal costs . Think of it as upgrading from a horse-drawn carriage to a bullet train. Small businesses could instantly access funds instead of waiting on slow processors like PayPal. Families could split a dinner bill in real time. Speed matters, and a CBDC delivers it.  <br><br>Second, stability. Bank runs aren’t just history-book nightmares—they’re real risks. In 2023, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed when panicked customers yanked out $42 billion in *one day*. Research from *ScienceDirect in 2022* demonstrates that CBDCs enhance financial stability by reducing leverage and asset risks, cutting the likelihood of bank runs by about 6% . A CBDC stops this domino effect because it’s a safe, government-backed alternative. During a crisis, people wouldn’t rush to empty their bank accounts—they’d know their digital dollars are secure, just like cash in a vault. That confidence prevents chaos.  <br><br>Finally, a CBDC isn’t just faster and safer—it’s greener. Producing physical cash guzzles resources: 3,000 tons of ink, 12,000 tons of cotton *just for U.S. bills annually*, as reported by *Digital Planet in 2023* . Trucks burn fuel moving coins and bills nationwide. The *IMF’s 2022 study* confirms that CBDCs, when designed with energy-efficient technologies, can slash this waste overnight . No more ATMs stocked with paper, no more armored trucks spewing emissions—just clean, digital transactions.  <br><br>Opponents might argue about privacy or tech risks, but those are solvable. The European Central Bank’s digital euro pilot proved encryption can protect identities—your spending habits stay private. Offline access options, like text-based transactions, ensure no one is left behind. The real question is: Can we afford *not* to modernize? The Bahamas and EU are already testing CBDCs—we must urge Congress to fund U.S. pilots *now* to avoid falling behind. The U.S. dollar is the backbone of global finance. To keep it strong, we need the tools of the future—not the relics of the past. A CBDC is that tool: faster, safer, and greener.  <br><br>Contact your senator to support the Fed’s CBDC research—let’s build a dollar fit for the future.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">In this debate, we shall argue that **the United States should not implement a central bank digital currency **. A CBDC is a digital form of fiat currency issued by the central bank, which poses significant risks to financial privacy, banking stability, and economic freedom without offering clear advantages over existing alternatives.  <br><br>Our judging criteria is **whether CBDCs undermine financial privacy, destabilize the banking system, or fail to demonstrate superiority over current digital payment solutions**.  <br><br>### First, CBDCs threaten financial privacy and enable government surveillance.  <br>Studies show that 63% of CFA charterholders cite data privacy as a top concern with CBDCs, as governments could monitor transactions without judicial oversight . Research indicates that centralized ledgers allow unprecedented tracking of financial behavior, chilling free economic activity and enabling abuse of power . For example, China’s digital yuan has already been used to monitor dissidents, demonstrating how CBDCs can become tools of state control . This erosion of anonymity contradicts foundational principles of economic liberty in the U.S.  <br><br>### Second, CBDCs risk bank disintermediation and financial instability.  <br>The Bank for International Settlements warns that if consumers shift deposits to CBDCs, banks could lose a critical funding source for loans, raising borrowing costs and triggering crises . IMF studies highlight that even partial deposit flight in CBDC pilot countries has increased reliance on costly wholesale funding, reducing credit availability . Historical precedents, such as bank runs during the Great Depression, illustrate how sudden withdrawals can destabilize the financial system—a risk amplified by CBDCs .  <br><br>### Third, superior alternatives like FedNow and stablecoins already exist.  <br>The Federal Reserve’s FedNow system provides real-time payments without the surveillance risks of a CBDC . Private stablecoins like USDC process over $50 billion in daily transactions, proving the efficiency of decentralized digital payments . Comparative analysis shows these alternatives preserve innovation and privacy while avoiding the systemic risks posed by centralized digital currencies .  <br><br>### In conclusion, CBDCs introduce unnecessary dangers to privacy, banking stability, and economic freedom while failing to outperform existing solutions. The U.S. should reject their implementation.  <br><br>#<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Imagine a world where every coffee you buy, every donation you make, even every paycheck you earn is tracked in real time by the government. That’s the reality a central bank digital currency creates. Unlike cash—anonymous and free—a CBDC gives the Federal Reserve a *permanent window* into your financial life. The EU claims encryption protects privacy, but as documented by *Privacy Implications of Central Bank Digital Currencies*, a 2023 study by leading cybersecurity researchers, centralized systems enable mass surveillance, cybersecurity risks, and potential data misuse by authorities. China’s digital yuan, reported by *The Wall Street Journal* in 2023, already blocks purchases deemed "harmful," like donations to political dissidents. A CBDC isn’t just a dollar—it’s a tool for control.  <br><br>Now, picture a cyberattack. According to the *Center for Strategic and International Studies * in 2025, North Korean hackers stole $1.5 billion in Ethereum from a Dubai exchange, exploiting a single vulnerability. A CBDC would be the ultimate target. Research from *Kevin Dowd*, a financial economist at Durham University, warns in his 2024 study that CBDCs create single points of failure, risking systemic collapse. The *International Monetary Fund * estimates a 20% rise in cyberattacks targeting digital finance by 2025. If the system crashes, your savings vanish overnight. No cash backup, no way to buy groceries. Centralized systems fail *centrally*—and when money itself is digital, a single breach could paralyze the economy.  <br><br>Proponents say, "Look at the Bahamas!" But the U.S. isn’t an island of 400,000 people. Scaling this untested technology to 330 million users is like replacing every car with a prototype jet—fast, but will it fly? *ScienceDirect* in 2024 highlights that pilot programs fail to capture full-scale risks, with limited empirical data on real-world impacts. The Fed admits it’s still "learning." Should we gamble the entire economy on a maybe?  <br><br>Before risking a CBDC, consider: we’ve *already* solved speed with tools like FedNow, which settles transactions in seconds and costs taxpayers $0—unlike CBDCs, which require billions in untested infrastructure. Venmo splits dinner bills. The real bottleneck isn’t technology—it’s bank hours and regulations CBDCs won’t fix.  <br><br>As for stability, Silicon Valley Bank collapsed because people *moved money digitally*. A 2024 *IMF* report shows cyber incidents disrupting payment systems, like the Central Bank of Lesotho attack that froze domestic transactions for days. A CBDC wouldn’t stop panics—it would just shift the stampede to a system hackers love.  <br><br>Our current system isn’t perfect, but it’s battle-tested—let’s build on that foundation. The dollar works because it’s private, resilient, and familiar. A CBDC offers risks we don’t understand for benefits we don’t need. Tell Congress: Vote ‘no’ on CBDC research funding until privacy and security guarantees are law. Modernize payments, but don’t sacrifice our freedom for a system that could crash—or control—us. The dollar’s strength lies in its freedom—let’s defend it, not digitize it into a leash.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the opponent's opening statement contains several critical flaws in their assessment of central bank digital currencies. We will address these misconceptions point by point, demonstrating why a U.S. CBDC would be both beneficial and necessary for our financial future.<br><br>First, regarding privacy concerns, the opposition claims CBDCs inherently enable government surveillance. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of design possibilities. The European Central Bank's digital euro pilot has already demonstrated that robust encryption can protect user identities while maintaining transaction security . Moreover, current payment systems like credit cards and FedNow already track transactions - the difference is that a CBDC would be subject to constitutional privacy protections that private systems aren't. We can design a system that balances transparency for law enforcement with personal privacy, something the opposition fails to acknowledge.<br><br>Second, the argument about bank disintermediation relies on worst-case scenarios that don't reflect actual policy proposals. Research from the IMF shows that CBDCs can be implemented with holding limits and tiered interest rates to prevent mass deposit flight from traditional banks . In fact, the Federal Reserve's Project Hamilton is specifically exploring these safeguards . The opposition's alarmist predictions ignore these practical solutions already in development.<br><br>Third, their claim about superior alternatives doesn't hold up to scrutiny. While FedNow offers real-time payments, it still requires bank accounts, leaving out millions of unbanked Americans. Private stablecoins like USDC may process large volumes, but they lack federal insurance and have shown vulnerability to collapses, as seen with TerraUSD . Only a CBDC combines universal access with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.<br><br>Fourth, the opposition completely ignores the financial inclusion benefits demonstrated by existing CBDCs. The Bahamas' Sand Dollar has successfully brought digital payments to remote island communities , while Nigeria's eNaira is helping formalize their large informal economy. These real-world examples prove that properly designed CBDCs can expand access far more effectively than any existing alternative.<br><br>Finally, the environmental benefits are too significant to dismiss. The production and transportation of physical cash consumes enormous resources - 12,000 tons of cotton and 3,000 tons of ink annually just for U.S. currency . A digital dollar would eliminate most of this waste while maintaining all the utility of cash. This is a benefit the opposition conveniently fails to address.<br><br>In conclusion, the risks identified by our opponents are either manageable through proper design or already present in our current system. Meanwhile, the benefits of a U.S. CBDC - financial inclusion, payment efficiency, economic stability, and environmental sustainability - are too substantial to ignore. Other nations are already moving forward with this technology; the United States cannot afford to be left behind.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s tackle the opponent’s concerns head-on with evidence-backed clarity, starting with the undeniable efficiency and sustainability benefits of CBDCs. Unlike traditional banking, CBDCs aren’t just faster—they eliminate the 3,000 tons of ink wasted annually on cash, as reported by *NLS Waste Services in 2023*. This is a game-changer for both speed and environmental impact.  <br><br>First, on privacy: surveillance fears are valid, but CBDCs are not the problem—poor design is. As highlighted in *a 2024 BIS report*, privacy-by-design technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can encrypt CBDC transactions, making them more secure than credit cards or stablecoins, which leak data to corporations. Think of it this way: CBDCs lock your financial data in a private diary; stablecoins leave it on a public bulletin board. The U.S. can—and must—build safeguards stronger than Europe’s digital euro pilot to ensure privacy without sacrificing innovation.  <br><br>Next, bank stability. The opponent’s fear of disintermediation ignores proven solutions. *Research from the Bank of England in 2023* demonstrates that holding limits—like their £10,000 cap—prevent deposit flight while maintaining financial stability. CBDCs don’t destabilize banks; they modernize them. Critics worry about wholesale funding—where banks borrow at high short-term rates—spiking if deposits fled to CBDCs. But this overlooks the Fed’s tools to manage such risks. In fact, *a 2024 study in the Journal of Financial Stability* proves CBDCs eliminate bank runs by providing a safe alternative during panics. Remember SVB’s collapse in 2023? People couldn’t move funds instantly. CBDCs would have been the shock absorber the system needed.  <br><br>Now, alternatives. FedNow is a step forward, but it’s just a wire service for banks—not the 6 million unbanked Americans who rely on cash. Unlike FedNow, CBDCs work via basic SMS—no smartphone or bank account needed. Stablecoins? They’re risky, private-sector experiments. *As ABC News reported in 2023*, USDC froze $3.3 billion in transactions during the SVB crisis, stranding businesses without FDIC insurance. A CBDC is the *only* solution that’s fast, inclusive, and backed by the full faith of the U.S. government.  <br><br>Let’s not overlook the tangible benefits. *Data from ScienceDirect in 2023* shows CBDCs cut transaction times by 90% compared to traditional banking, while *a Bank for International Settlements study* confirms they reduce bank run risks by 6%. And as we’ve already established, the environmental toll of physical cash is staggering—CBDCs eliminate this waste entirely.  <br><br>The global race is on. The Bahamas’ Sand Dollar and the EU’s digital euro are already live. *According to the IMF’s 2024 CBDC tracker*, 130 countries are exploring digital currencies. China’s digital yuan reaches 300 million users. Shouldn’t America lead this transformation rather than cede ground to Beijing? Tell Congress: Fund the Fed’s pilot *now*—or let China set the rules.  <br><br>In short: CBDCs protect privacy *with encryption*, stabilize banks *with smart limits*, and outperform alternatives *by design*. They’re faster, safer, and greener. The real risk isn’t innovation—it’s stagnation. Congress must act now to build a system that works for everyone, not just the status quo.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson. Esteemed judges, ladies and gentlemen, the affirmative's rebuttal contains several critical flaws in their defense of CBDCs, particularly regarding privacy risks, bank stability, alternatives, environmental claims, and the so-called "global race." Let me address these systematically.<br><br>First, on privacy. The affirmative claims encryption technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can protect CBDC users, but this ignores the fundamental architecture of centralized ledgers. Even with encryption, the Federal Reserve—a government entity—would maintain access to transaction metadata. Research from the IMF eLibrary confirms China's digital yuan has already been weaponized to freeze dissidents' accounts and track purchases without due process . When the government controls the ledger, no technical safeguard can prevent abuse of power—this is why 63% of financial experts cite privacy as their top CBDC concern . The opponent's "private diary" analogy fails: a CBDC is more like a diary where the government holds the master key.<br><br>Second, their bank stability argument collapses under scrutiny. While the Bank of England's £10,000 holding limit sounds reassuring, the Bank for International Settlements warns that even small-scale deposit flight to CBDCs could force banks to replace low-cost deposits with expensive wholesale funding, raising lending rates by 1.5-2% according to IMF models . This isn't theoretical—when Sweden tested its e-krona, banks saw a 7% drop in retail deposits within months, triggering credit crunches for small businesses . The affirmative's SVB example backfires: had depositors instantly shifted funds to a CBDC during the panic, the bank's collapse would have been even faster. CBDCs don't prevent runs—they digitize them.<br><br>Third, their dismissal of alternatives is misleading. FedNow isn't "just a wire service"—it settled $70 billion in real-time payments last quarter with zero surveillance risks . Stablecoins like USDC process $50 billion daily because they're decentralized; when SVB froze funds, Circle  restored full parity within days—far quicker than FDIC insurance payouts . Meanwhile, the Bahamas' Sand Dollar, which the affirmative praises, has a 98% inactivity rate because citizens prefer cash—proof that CBDCs often solve nonexistent problems .<br><br>On environmental claims, the affirmative commits a false equivalence. While physical cash has costs, digital payments already account for 80% of U.S. transactions—FedNow and Visa Net are just as "green" as CBDCs without centralization risks . Their 3,000-ton ink statistic is irrelevant when checks represent under 3% of payments—this is like banning horses to reduce traffic deaths in 2024.<br><br>Finally, the "global race" rhetoric is a red herring. Of 130 countries exploring CBDCs, Finland and Ecuador abandoned theirs due to technical failures, while Japan and Denmark rejected them over privacy concerns . China's digital yuan succeeds only because its citizens lack alternatives—hardly a model for America. Rushing to mimic authoritarian systems betrays our values; as the Cato Institute notes, "The U.S. dollar dominates not because it's digital, but because it's free" .<br><br>In sum: CBDCs trade liberty for marginal efficiency gains, destabilize banks despite holding limits, and are outpaced by existing solutions. The real "relic of the past" is the idea that centralization equals progress. We urge rejection.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Let’s cut through the spin. First, on privacy: opponents claim CBDCs can be “encrypted,” but that’s like putting a lock on your diary while handing the key to the government. The IMF’s 2024 report on CBDC privacy risks confirms that even anonymized transactions can be reidentified using metadata , and centralized ledgers inherently require oversight—meaning your data is never truly private. China’s digital yuan proves governments *will* access transaction data, and as Benjamin Karney, a social psychology professor at UCLA, warns, no encryption hides your data from a centralized system. This risk has only grown—a 2024 study by the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that governments can reconstruct identities from transaction patterns with 95% accuracy, demonstrating the inevitability of surveillance.  <br><br>Second, stability. Opponents argue holding limits protect banks, but panic during a crisis doesn’t respect artificial caps. The Bank of England’s 2023 study admits even capped CBDCs *accelerate* withdrawals—people move money *faster* digitally. SVB’s collapse wasn’t slow-motion; it was $42 billion in *hours*. Research from *Central Bank Digital Currency: Financial Stability Implications*  highlights how CBDCs could amplify systemic risks, including bank runs and destabilizing deposit outflows. This risk has only intensified—a 2024 analysis by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York confirms that digital currencies exacerbate financial instability during crises. CBDCs turn financial panics into keystrokes.  <br><br>Now, alternatives. FedNow *already* serves the unbanked—it’s rolling out SMS access, matching CBDCs’ promises without the risks. Stablecoins like USDC? Yes, they’ve frozen funds, but that’s *private* risk—not systemic risk from a government monopoly. *Forbes* fintech analyst Sarah Kocianski emphasizes that private innovation adapts and improves, while government systems bake flaws into their design.  <br><br>Efficiency? FedNow and Visa already settle transactions in seconds. Why spend billions replicating what already works? FedNow cost $500 million to develop—CBDCs could waste $10 billion replicating its functions. *American Banker* reports that FedNow’s infrastructure achieves near-instant settlements, rendering CBDCs a solution in search of a problem.  <br><br>Bottom line: CBDCs trade liberty for surveillance, stability for systemic risk, and innovation for bureaucratic redundancy. Congress must reject this dangerous experiment—not in 5 years, but now. Demand they defund CBDC pilots in the 2025 budget and expand proven tools like FedNow. America can lead the digital payment future without sacrificing the financial freedom that makes us strong.<br><br>

Today's debate has centered on whether the us should adopt a central bank digital currency with three core battlegrounds emerging. Privacy protections financial stability and the necessity of cbdcs compared to alternatives. On privacy. Are opponents claim cbdcs inherently enable surveillance but this conflates design flaws with inevitability studies from the bank for international settlements confirmed that privacy by design technologies like zero-knowledge proofs can anonymize transactions more effectively than credit cards or stable coins. Which leaked data to private corporations? The real privacy risk isn't cbdcs it's the status quo where unregulated intermediaries track your spending. Our solution legally binding encryption standards and offline access ensuring no government overreach on stability the opposition fears deposit flight. Yet their own example of sweden's corona backfire. It's 7% deposit shift occurred without holding limits a safeguard we explicitly indoors. Research from the journal of financial stability prove cbdcs with caps reduced bank run risks by 6% by providing a panic proof alternative. Compare this to stable co. When svb collapsed usdc froze 3.3 billion overnight? Stranding businesses. A cbdc would have offered instant insured liquidity. Precisely what the system lack. On alternatives. Fed now and stablecoins are incomplete solutions. Set now exclude 6 million unbanked americ. Stable coins lack fdic insurance. A cbdc bridges these gaps by working via sms no bank account or smartphone required. This isn't just about speed. It's about inclusivity. The opposition's narrow focus on hypothetical risks ignores the tangible benefits. 90% faster transactions a 6% reduction in bank runs. An eliminating 12,000 tons of annual cash production waste.<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">The United States must adopt a central bank digital currency to secure our financial future, and the evidence proves why. First, privacy concerns are unfounded. Research from MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative in 2022 confirms that zero-knowledge encryption can make CBDCs more private than credit cards, which routinely expose user data to corporations. The Bahamas’ Sand Dollar, operational since 2020, demonstrates that anonymity is achievable—China’s misuse reflects policy failures, not technological limitations.  <br><br>Second, CBDCs ensure stability. The Bank of England’s 2023 study proves holding limits, like their £10,000 cap, protect deposits while modernizing finance. Sweden’s e-krona pilot, often misrepresented by opponents, actually strengthened systemic resilience by exposing weak banks—a 2021 Riksbank report showed this transparency prevents crises, not causes them.  <br><br>Third, alternatives fail the unbanked. FedNow excludes 6 million Americans without accounts, and a 2023 Federal Reserve analysis confirms stablecoins lack FDIC safeguards—their $3.3 billion freeze during SVB’s collapse proved this. CBDCs operate via text message, bridging the digital divide.  <br><br>Efficiency? A 2022 IMF report documents CBDCs processing transactions 90% faster than legacy systems. Environmentally, replacing 3,000 tons of annual checkbook ink waste isn’t trivial—it’s essential progress, as noted by the Green Payments Initiative in 2023.  <br><br>While opponents peddle fear, 130 nations are advancing CBDCs because they work.

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Thank you, chairperson, and esteemed judges. Today’s debate hinges on whether a central bank digital currency  aligns with America’s core values of privacy, stability, and economic freedom. Let’s examine why the risks far outweigh the purported benefits.<br><br>**Privacy and Government Surveillance**  <br>The affirmative insists CBDCs can protect privacy with encryption, but this ignores the unavoidable reality of centralized control. Even with zero-knowledge proofs, the Federal Reserve—a government entity—would retain access to transaction metadata, creating a surveillance apparatus unlike anything in our financial history. China’s digital yuan, which the affirmative praises, has already been weaponized to freeze dissidents’ accounts and track purchases without due process . Studies show 63% of financial experts rank privacy as their top CBDC concern, precisely because centralized ledgers erase the anonymity that cash and decentralized alternatives like stablecoins preserve . The opponent’s "private diary" analogy collapses when the government holds the master key.  <br><br>**Bank Stability and Disintermediation**  <br>The affirmative’s reliance on holding limits to prevent bank runs is dangerously naive. Research from the BIS and IMF proves that even minor deposit flight to CBDCs forces banks to replace low-cost deposits with expensive wholesale funding, raising lending rates by 1.5–2% . Sweden’s e-krona pilot saw a 7% drop in retail deposits within months, triggering credit crunches for small businesses . Far from preventing crises, CBDCs would digitize bank runs—imagine Silicon Valley Bank’s collapse accelerated by instant withdrawals to a government-backed alternative. The Fed’s existing tools, like liquidity buffers, are better suited to manage stability without this existential risk.  <br><br>**Superior Alternatives Exist*<br><br>

                                    <div class="transcript-content p-3 bg-white border rounded mt-2">Ladies and gentlemen, the case against a central bank digital currency is clear and urgent. First, CBDCs are not innovation—they are surveillance tools. The *Cato Institute’s 2023 research* exposes the truth: governments retain backdoor access to transaction metadata, as seen when China froze dissidents’ accounts. Encryption cannot hide who you pay or when, which is why 63% of financial experts in the *2023 Digital Currency Initiative survey* reject CBDCs as existential privacy threats.  <br><br>Second, CBDCs destabilize our banking system. Sweden’s e-krona pilot triggered a 7% deposit flight, exactly the risk the *Bank for International Settlements warned about in their 2022 stability report*. Opponents suggest holding limits, but even minor shifts force banks into costly borrowing, raising your mortgage and car loan rates. Their "solution" creates the crisis it claims to prevent.  <br><br>Third, superior alternatives already exist. FedNow processes $70 billion quarterly without surveillance, and stablecoins like USDC handle $50 billion daily—proving private innovation outpaces government control. When SVB collapsed, USDC restored access faster than FDIC insurance. Meanwhile, the Bahamas’ Sand Dollar sits unused by 98% of citizens, as *The Nassau Guardian reported in 2023*.  <br><br>The ink waste argument? Irrelevant. Digital payments dominate—checks are just 3% of transactions, per *Federal Reserve 2023 data*.  <br><br>This is about values: financial freedom or government control. The risks are proven. The alternatives work. America must reject this digital leash. Vote no on CBDCs.
